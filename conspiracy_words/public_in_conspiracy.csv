he wrote a White House official that he was in favor of a "National Endowment in support of free institutions throughout the world" >The NED was initially placed under the auspices of the National Security Council and one Walter Raymond Jr a CIA propaganda expert who according to the late Robert Parry for years acted as liaison between the program and Casey Raymond also drew charming doodles like this depicting himself as a literal puppeteer controlling many different strings >The organization was stacked with prominent neoconservatives like Lane Kirkland John Richardson and Allen Weinstein Carl Gershman a longtime professional anticommunist was its first and so far only president One of its current board members Elliott Abrams is a war criminal with a history of subverting democracy overseas >To prevent the odor of US imperialism from contaminating the NEDs work the Reagan administration made it a private organization that in turn funded several more private institutions including the NDI and IRI But the fact that it was routinely staffed with former US officials and got its funding from the US government has always made this a dubious conceit >Equally dubious was the idea that its task was simply to promote democracy Two of its "core grantees"  which receive around 70 percent of its funding  are explicitly right wing: the IRI which is a GOP-led institution that once described its goals as advancing "democracy the rule of law and free-market economics"; and the Center for International Private Enterprise a project of the **US Chamber of Commerce** Even the Solidarity Center (formerly the Free Trade Union Institute) which is affiliated with the **AFL-CIO** went on to support conservative causes Only the NDI the Democrats arm could be said to be anywhere left of center Overall the NEDs track record tilts decidedly to the right CIPE and The Solidarity Center are two of the four grantees of the [NED](https://wwwsolidaritycenterorg/national-endowment-for-democracy-ned-ndi-iri-cipe-and-solidarity-center-welcome-increased-funding-from-congress/) NED does what the CIA used to do behind closed doors I thought the NED was pretty interesting considering Time Magazines story about the secret shadow campaign to save the [2020 election](https://timecom/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/) The article mentions multiple times how the group was working to protect and save Democracy (democracy is used ~33 times in the article) The article also outlines an alliance that included the AFL-CIO and the US Chamber of Commerce: >The pact was formalized in a terse little-noticed joint statement of the US Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO published on Election Day This article from [socialismcom](https://socialismcom/fs-article/betrayal-from-venezuela-to-iraq-the-afl-cio-and-the-national-endowment-for-democracy/) discusses how NED is a CIA front is funded by the US government and works closely with the leaders of the AFL-CIO: >A little-known far-right organization with a warm and fuzzy name the National Endowment for Democracy is up to no good in at least 40 countries That is bad enough especially given that the money for NEDs dirty deeds comes from working taxpayers courtesy of the US Congress Truly appalling however is the role that leaders of the AFL-CIO the largest US labor federation play in carrying out the work of this agency > A CIA front is born During the late 1970s the CIA was exposed for its active sabotage of numerous governments and progressive labor movements abroad Not so publicized was the AFL-CIOs role in aiding the CIA >Operating through the American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD) the AFL-CIO aided the overthrow of democratically elected governments in Guyana in 1963 Brazil in 1964 the Dominican Republic in 1965 and Chile in 1973 These are just a few examples of labor officialdoms shameful record in helping to carry out corporate-propelled US foreign policy >In 1983 after the CIA was widely discredited Ronald Reagans administration created a new agency the NED to take care of old business As an NED founder Allen Weinstein put it in 1991: "A lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA" >In his hard-hitting book Rogue State: A Guide to the Worlds Only Superpower William Blum describes some of the agencys activities "NED successfully manipulated elections in Nicaragua in 1990 and Mongolia in 1996 helped to overthrow democratically elected governments in Bulgaria in 1990 and Albania in 1991 and 1992 and was busy working in Haiti in the late 1990s on behalf of rightwing groups **NED like the CIA before it calls what it does supporting democracy** The governments and movements whom the NED targets call it destabilization" From the [Time 2020 election story:](https://timecom/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/) >"The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation" says Norm Eisen >The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation >The system didnt work magically Democracy is not self-executing" >And they believe the public needs to understand the systems fragility in order to ensure that democracy in America endures,Settlemente,16187557890,1

gxactiw,n6w42q,There are 17 transnational companies at the top who control well over 42 trillion dollars in investments They have board members of around 200 people that make all the decisions for these companies and they set the financial policies for the world All of the billionaires multimillionaires and most of the millionaires are invested in these companies These people know each other or know of each other Theyre kids go to the same schools While they are competitive they also love money They have discovered that they can make unholy amounts of money not by competing but by working together They collaborate collude to price fix rig scam steal plunder and buy laws that enrich and protect them They use their combined interests in a thug/mafia/mercenary style use of the us army to force countries to bend to their will or else They fill all the important positions in the us government with their own people to further and protect their interests There are other transnational firms very large who also follow what they do They have more money then they know what to do with The problem they have is finding a safe investment with consistent and good returns because they own most everything already This has led them push for and to prolong wars one of the best and safest investment for long term profits This has also led them to take on riskier investments which has been wrecking the economy but they know the government will bail them out The lack of good places to invest has led them to start buying up public institutions for example they want to bankrupt the post office so they can privatize it They want to privatize government infrastructure and the military They are desperately trying to find new ways to bring profits but they have more money than worthwhile places to invest it Bezos gatesmusk and all the names you know are part of these institutions that control the financial system of nearly the entire planet They are not working for the betterment of mankind or for the people They control the us government and nearly all governments to their own enrichment while the names you know contribute to our problems they are not at the top of the power structure they have a voice and play a role in the ruination of lives and planet The real power structure are the transnational investment firms that represent the "combined rich" and decide whats bests for their investments and control both the governments and the laws This doesnt mean the rich cant/wont use their money/power but it means that the bigger power is not what a single billionaire is doing but what the combined group is doing together All billionaires and multi billionaires are heavily invested in at least one of these firms and most millionaires but not all are also invested Theyre business interests are interwoven with each other so trying to interfere or stop them you are not just taking on one of them but these firms have the resources of unimaginable wealth and power behind them They can not be stopped,34831,16204034560,1

The occult meaning for that: Not knowing the difference between right & wrong Police officers owners and they *do* have owners put that symbolism there intentionally as a form of mockery They put it directly around police officers brains Their owners laugh hysterically about this behind closed doors The problem is those who work in law enforcement have confused man-made law with actual justice (Natural Law) They dont see the difference - and there is an *enormous* difference They need an understanding of Natural Law and there is a lot of effort put forth to hide knowledge of Natural Law from the public Natural Law is logic-based and contains absolute truths about morality Man-made laws on the other hand involve people writing down that they have "authority" over others and then mind-controlling the public into believing that makes that authority real Of course it doesnt in reality But the reason things like Epsteins death are allowed to happen is because the people working in law enforcement simply do as theyre told by their higher-ups regardless of whether its actually right or wrong No real improvement will occur for humanity in terms of all these conspiracies until far more people begin understanding Natural Law and applying it to their actions instead of believing in the supposed "authority" of government Thats the root of the problem for *all* conspiracies - and the solution We are quickly running out of time to do this And the vast majority of people believe in the legitimacy of the authority of government right now That needs to change Were nowhere near where we need to be with not much time left Anyone reading this please help spread the word about Natural Law Look into it for yourself if you dont know about it,Law_of_1,16197586280,3

h67hnxn,opbmcz,IS ANYONE APOLOGIZING TO GARY WEBB? by Michael Levine (DEA-RET) Gary Webb just in case youve already forgotten him was the journalist who in a well researched understated article entitled "The Dark Alliance" linked the CIA supported Contras to cocaine and weapons being sold to a California street gang and ended up literally being hounded out of journalism by every mainstream news peddling organization in the Yellow Pages Even his own employer The San Jose Mercury piled on for the kill And guess what? The CIA finally admitted yesterday in the New York Times no less that they in fact did "work with" the Nicaraguan Contras while they had information that they were involved in cocaine trafficking to the United States An action known to us court qualified experts and federal agents as Conspiracy to Import and Distribute Cocainea federal felony punishable by up to life in prison To illustrate how us regular walking around non CIA types are treated when we violate this law while I was serving as a DEA supervisor in New York City I put two New York City police officers in a federal prison for Conspiracy to distribute Cocaine when they looked the other way at their friends drug dealing We could not prove they earned a nickel nor that they helped their friend in any way they merely did not do their duty by reporting him They were sentenced to 10 and 12 years respectively and one of them I was recently told had committed suicide I have spent three decades as a court qualified expert and federal agent and am not aware of any class of American Citizen having special permission to violate the law that we have been taxed over $1 trillion in the past two decades to enforce; the law that every politician bureaucrat and media pundit keeps telling us protects us against the most serious danger to American security in our historyThe interesting thing to me about the Webb article is that the CIA is provably (and now admittedly) responsible for much larger scale drug trafficking than Webb alleged or even imagined in his report In fact according to a confidential DEA report entitled "Operation Hun a Chronology" that I used as part of the proof to back up the undercover experiences detailed in my book The Big White Lie (optioned for a movie by Robert Greenwald Productions) the CIA was actively blocking DEA from indicting many members of the ruling government of Bolivia from 1980-83during a time period that these same people were responsible for producing more than 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States As CIA Inspector General Hitz himself stated before congress it was during this time period that Nicaraguan Contra supporters were buying large amounts of cocaine from these same CIA protected Bolivians Do you think Congress wants to see this proof? The gang that cant spy straight as they are known to my listeners and about whom President Lyndon Johnson once said "When Rich folks dont trust their sons with the family money they send them on down to the CIA" certainly did a lot more damage to this nation than for example computer company owner Will Foster who was sentenced to 93 years in prison for possession of 70 marijuana plants for medicinal use Of course true to their shifty sleazy form while admitting that they did aid and abet Contra drug trafficking they are now refusing to release their own final investigative report which details the damning proof The same report that CIA Inspector General Fredrick Hitz during February 1998 had promised congress and the American people was forthcoming "shortly" because as CIA Director George Tenet now claims CIA does not have enough money in its budget to properly classify it You believe that then I know an old guy with a beard named Fidel wandering the streets of South Miami with an Island about 90 miles off the coast for sale He says the money is for his retirement How you ask do they get away with it? Well for one thing mainstream media the so-called Fourth Estate does all it can to help During the Iran-contra hearings when Senators Kerry and Damato were making pronouncements before the Senate indicating that the CIA was involved with drug trafficking Katherine Graham the owner of The Washington Post addressed a class of CIA recruits at CIAs Langley headquarters in November 1988 by saying: "There are some things the general public does not need to know and shouldnt I believe democracy flourishes when the government can take legitimate steps to keep its secrets and when the press can decide whether to print what it knows" Apparently CIA protection of drug trafficking was among those secrets Thus it should have been no surprise to those CIA agent recruits when Washington Post reporter and drug expert Michael Itsikoff wrote that there was "no credible evidence" linking the CIA supported contras to cocaine trafficking at the same time very credible evidence was being heard by Senator Kerrys committee indicating that the Contras may have been the top purveyors of drugs to Americans in our historyNeither should it have been a surprise to anyone who heard her statement when mainstream media refused to print the news that Oliver North US Ambassador to Costa Rica Lewis Tambs and various top level CIA officers were banned from ever entering Costa Rica by Nobel Prize winning President Oscar Arias for drug running The drugs by the way all going to us Nor should it have been a surprise when Gary Webb was destroyed by mainstream media for doing nothing more or less than telling the truth as he found it And now while CIA admits their felonies to the press but refuses to release the proof and Janet Reno the head of the Obstruction of Justice Department has done the unprecedented by classifying her own departments investigation into CIA drug trafficking the partnership for a Drug Free America is spending $2 billion of our tax money on already-proven-fruitless anti-drug ads And where do you think the money goes? Answer: to every major media corporation on the big board Gary Webb my friend you are owed a huge apology But I doubt that youll get it Not in this lifetime,shylock92008,16270105150,2

h6724ku,opbmcz,From 1982 to 1995 the CIA did not to have to report if they suspected any of their agents of dealing drugs Why? Its the kind of government exchange you assume never actually takes place But it did And it went something like this: CIA Chief: Dear Attorney General Do you mind if CIA agents or informants are dealing drugs? I mean we dont have to tell on them do we? Attorney General: Of course not! Well you did But I just changed the law Dont worry about it CIA Chief: Gee thanks! This may sound absurd but according to a series of recently declassified documents obtained by the MoJo Wire its just what happened in the spring of 1982 Letter From Bill Casey To William French Smith https://webarchiveorg/web/20070613130342/https://wwwciagov/library/reports/general-reports-1/cocaine/contra-story/01gif Letter From William French Smith to Bill Casey https://webarchiveorg/web/20070613154234/https://wwwciagov/library/reports/general-reports-1/cocaine/contra-story/02gif Letter from the DOJ Codifying the MOU https://webarchiveorg/web/20070613051429/https://wwwciagov/library/reports/general-reports-1/cocaine/contra-story/14gif Central Intelligence Agency Director William Caseys request to then-Attorney General William French Smith isnt in the public domain But two letters one from Smith thanking Casey for his request and a follow-up by Casey are both available They were released as part of a internal CIA report that explored allegations of CIA involvement in drug trafficking (The most comprehensive allegations were reported by Gary Webb in a series of San Jose Mercury News reports and a book entitled "Dark Alliance") In the first document Smith thanks Casey for his letter (the one that isnt public) and says: "in view of the fine cooperation the Drug Enforcement Administration has received from CIA no formal requirement regarding the reporting of narcotics violations has been included in these procedures"--William French SmithAttorney General Casey in return thanks the Attorney General for his understanding: "I am pleased that these procedures which I believe strike the proper balance between enforcement of the law and protection of intelligence sources and methods will now be forwarded to other agencies"--William J CaseyDirector Central Intelligence Agency\[See the full document\] The two men then codified their agreement in a Memorandum of Understanding According to the agreement intelligence agencies would not have to report if any of their agents were involved in drug running (By agents the agreement meant CIA sources and informants Full-time employees still couldnt deal drugs) That understanding remained in effect until August of 1995 when current Attorney General Janet Reno rescinded the agreement Its reasonable that the CIA be allowed to keep its mouth shut if it knows that some of its agents are involved in minor illegal affairs Presumably some of the value of informants comes from the fact that they keep company with shady characters who engage in unlawful activities But why would the CIA ask to be exempt specifically from drug enforcement laws? According to Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif) who is calling for full disclosure of the facts "The CIA knew that the Contras were dealing drugs They made this deal with the Attorney General to protect themselves from having to report it" Some of the remaining questions may still be answered The Department of Justice and the CIA have finished separate investigations into possible CIA involvement in drug smuggling But neither report has been made available to the public; the Justice department cites an "ongoing investigation" while the CIA says their report is an internal document and therefore classified Says Congresswoman Waters: "What is it they dont want Americans to see?

h674p5o,opbmcz,1998: CIA Says It Used Nicaraguan Rebels Accused of Drug Tie; By James Risen July 17 1998 ; "The agencys decision to keep those paid agents or to continue dealing with them in some less formal relationship was made by top officials at headquarters in Langley Va" - NYT  https://wwwnytimescom/1998/07/17/world/cia-says-it-used-nicaraguan-rebels-accused-of-drug-tiehtml CIA Says It Used Nicaraguan Rebels Accused of Drug Tie By James Risen July 17 1998 The Central Intelligence Agency continued to work with about two dozen Nicaraguan rebels and their supporters during the 1980s despite allegations that they were trafficking in drugs according to a classified study by the CIA The new study has found that the agencys decision to keep those paid agents or to continue dealing with them in some less formal relationship was made by top officials at headquarters in Langley Va in the midst of the war waged by the CIA-backed contras against Nicaraguas leftist Sandinista Government The new report by the CIAs inspector general criticizes agency officials actions at the time for the inconsistent and sometimes sloppy manner in which they investigated -- or chose not to investigate -- the allegations which were never substantiated by the agency The inspector generals report which has not yet been publicly released also concludes that there is no evidence that any CIA officials were involved in drug trafficking with contra figures The fundamental finding of the report is that there is no information that the CIA or CIA employees ever conspired with any contra organizations or individuals involved with the contras for purposes of drug trafficking a United States intelligence official said The new report is the long-delayed second volume of the CIAs internal investigation into possible connections between the contras and Central American drug traffickers The investigation was originally prompted by a 1996 series in The San Jose Mercury-News which asserted that a dark alliance between the CIA the contras and drug traffickers had helped finance the contra war with profits from drug smuggling The second volume dismisses those specific charges as did the first volume released in January The series charged that the alliance created a drug trafficking network that introduced crack cocaine into South Central Los Angeles It prompted an enormous outcry especially among blacks many of whom said they saw it as confirmation of a Government-backed conspiracy to keep blacks dependent and impoverished The Mercury-News subsequently admitted that the series was flawed and reassigned the reporter In the declassified version of the CIAs first volume the agency said the Mercury-News charges were baseless and mentioned drug dealers who had nothing to do with the CIA But John M Deutch the Director of Central Intelligence at the time had also asked the inspector general to conduct a broader inquiry to answer unresolved questions about the contra program and drug trafficking that had not been raised by The Mercury-News Frederick Hitz then the CIAs inspector general decided to issue a second larger report to deal with those broader issues Many allegations in the second volume track closely with charges that first surfaced in a 1987 Senate investigation The CIA is reluctant to release the complete 500-page second volume because it deals directly with contras the agency did work with According to the report CIA officials involved in the contra program were so focused on the fight against the Sandinistas that they gave relatively low priority to collecting information about the possible drug involvement of contra rebels The report concluded that CIA officers did report on drug trafficking by the contras but that there were no clear guidelines given to field officers about how intensively they should investigate or act upon the allegations In all the CIA received allegations of drug involvement against about 50 contras or supporters during the war against the Sandinistas the report said Some of the allegations may have been specious the result of Sandinista propaganda American intelligence officials said It could not be determined from the CIAs records how many of the 50 cases were fully investigated But the agency continued to work with about two dozen of the 50 contras according to American intelligence officials familiar with the report They said the report had found that the agency was unable to either prove or disprove the charges or did not investigate them adequately American intelligence officials who provided information about the report declined to identify the individual contras who were the subjects of the drug allegations But they did say that in addition to individual cases the report found that drug allegations had been made against one contra organization a group known as 15th of September That group was formed in 1980 and was disbanded in January 1982 The CIAs decision to classify this second volume has already been met with criticism in Congress Senator John Kerry Democrat of Massachusetts who led a 1987 Congressional inquiry into allegations of contra drug connections wrote a letter Thursday to the Director of Central Intelligence George J Tenet asking that the report be immediately declassified Mr Kerry who has reviewed the second volume of the inspector generals report said he believed that CIA officials involved in the contra program did not make a serious effort to fully investigate the allegations of drug involvement by the contras Some of us in Congress at the time in 1985 1986 were calling for a serious investigation of the charges and CIA officials did not join in that effort Mr Kerry said There was a significant amount of stonewalling Im afraid that what I read in the report documents the degree to which there was a lack of interest in making sure the laws were being upheld A version of this article appears in print on July 17 1998 Section A Page 2 of the National edition

I t is now clear that this agreement began with the events described in THE BIG WHITE LIE; that the top drug traffickers in Bolivia then supplying virtually all the worlds cocaine-including Sonia Atala-were CIA assets that had to be protected from our deep cover probe Laura and I still have the proof of this that we used to back up the publication THE BIG WHITE LIE The same proof was later incorporated into other data backing up the publications of DEEP COVER and TRIANGLE OF DEATH [https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/](https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/) Our evidence-which congress has been craning its neck not to see- for instance shows clearly that during Operation Hun (the story in The Big White Lie) secret meetings were held with CIA and Justice Department wherein all indictments of top government officials in Bolivia were blocked We now believe this agreement began because of Operation Hun CIA had to hide the fact that they were supporting the people manufacturing virtually all the cocaine being produced in the world at that time In Deep Cover we showed that during Operation Trifecta-a highly successful deep cover probe into the top of the drug world in three countries (Panama Bolivia and Mexico) -Attorney General of the US Ed Meese found it necessary to warn the Attorney General of Mexico about DEAs case We (undercover DEA agents and Customs agents) found links between top US government officials and the people who murdered DEA agent Kiki Camarena that to this day go unexamined by our congress or anyone else In "TRIANGLE OF DEATH a work of "faction" we showed CIAs real-life involvement in the protection and creation of one of the most murderous criminal organizations to ever plague America an organization created by escaped Nazi fugitives under CIA protection-events occurring long before this alleged CIA Justice agreement And so the dance continues If anyone watched the CNN show you cannot have helped but notice the snickering on the part of Congressional chairman Porter Goss (an ex CIA officer) as congresswoman Maxine Waters spoke Now heres the reason why: Sources of mine who speak to me from inside this veil of secrecy out of conscience and because I am cheaper and more reliable than a psychiatrist have already told me the following: There is secret communication between CIA and members of the Congressional staff-one must keep in mind that Porter Goss the chairman is an ex CIA official- indicating that the whole hearing is just a smoke and mirror show so that the American people-particularly the Black community- can "blow off some steam" without doing any damage to CIA The CIA has been assured that nothing real will be done other than some embarrassing questions being asked That the hearings will result in the CIA receiving even a larger budget than the current $26 billion that they admit to One of the most distressing things for me a 25 year veteran of this business to listen to was when Congresswoman Waters said that the hearings were not about CIA officers being indicted and going to jail "That is not going to happen" she said Almost in the same breath she spoke of a recent case in Miami wherein a Venezuelan National Guard general was caught by Customs agents smuggling more than a ton of cocaine into the US Despite named CIA officers being involved in the plot as Congresswoman Waters stated the Justice Department will not tell her anything about the case because of "secrecy laws" No wonder chairman Goss was snickering She could not have played more neatly into CIA hands than to surrender before the battle was engaged For the entire existence of CIA they have gotten away with doing more damage to the American people than all our traditional enemies combined precisely because no one was ever prosecuted From the CIA protection of Nazi criminals from war crimes prosecution as they set up criminal organizations that preyed on America (Triangle of Death) to their lies to President Kennedy that dragged us into Bay of Pigs to their lies to President Johnson that dragged us into the Vietnam War to their creation of a pan Arab army of American hating drug trafficking terrorists during the Afghan War to the Church Commission hearings to MK-Ultra to the Bolivian Cocaine Coup ("The Big White Lie") to their protection of the worlds top cocaine traffickers as they laid waste to American streets (Deep cover) the CIA has acted exactly as Senator Frank Church once described them: "a runaway rogue elephantcompletely unresponsive to Congressthey (the CIA) have not only been unproductive they have been contra productive they have brought great shame on America" And the dance continues &#x200B;

hrfghyd,rwkj3w,The worst is yet to come My religion (Orthodox) had prophecies about this and so far around 8-9 of them came true (theres more but they are some smaller ones so I wouldnt mention them) The one that is yet to come true is the one saying "once the humanity is at the point of not knowing what to do as times are getting worse and no solutions are to be found antichrist will appear with a solution" (I tried to translate it as best as I could) Vaccines are proving as failing which is exactly what they want The time will come when they will say publicly that they no longer know what to do and how to deal with the pandemic Thats when a *certain person* will appear with a "solution" to end all problems and he will be throned in UN as the humanitys saviour I made this as brief as I could as it is rather complex and in order to truly understand and believe all this youd need to know a lot of backstory Another huge one said that "there will be a global pandemic before the end" (This one was told about 200-300 years ago iirc) We live in the end times sadly You may or may not believe me but Ive been following advices that my religion told me due to these prophecies and I havent regretted a single decision I made thus far Ive simply been following prophecies and what they tell us to do and Im making it work Havent and wont take the vax as I know what it is leading towards,HRCK0,16414291920,2

We literally have satellites that can confirm identities indoors surveillance tech to collect data from all local cell phones a la Nolan Batman and can subpoena any tech company for their gathered data on pretty much everything else about your life if you carry a cell phone And yet 200 days later and the best they can do is hold a political trial in Congress Which is just judicial theater pulling on the heartstrings of voters and the wallets of corporate interests We didnt give bin Laden or McVeigh the luxury of hiding behind public perception I will NOT advocate for the same treatment to insurrectionists at this time but its hard to support this egregious lack of any action in a country where we have already had to sacrifice so much in the name of fasci I mean law and order,50kent,16274396460,1
h1em3pz,nx014g,uummm - i thought it caused ovarian cancer - - - & also though there is a *suggestion* of a possible link there is no conclusive data to presently back up that claim - - - https://wwwcancerorg/cancer/cancer-causes/talcum-powder-and-cancerhtml & btw - no one "puts" asbestos in a product - talc & asbestos are natural occurring substances that often form alongside each other in nature & therefore are mined together & yes J&J knew of this for at least 50yrs & basically didnt take action until litigation occurred J&J still sells talc-based baby powder outside of the US i think if none of you think that other corporations dont weigh litigation costs against profits - then you all are living in a dream world in a capitalistic world everything has either a cost-benefit or a cost-detriment which affects the most primal benefit - profit **Everything** - so even if a thing has a statistical potential of being life-threatening - if the cost-benefit is better then the making of the product will continue capitalism has no "morals" or "ethics" in any real sense - those words only mean something in the advertising sense - ie good or bad publicity,cjgager,16234211910,3

h1ekr1n,nx014g,Insane they dont care about a single American None of big corporations give a damn except profits and market share The root of all evil is corporate America and politicians in DC,RepublicKev,16234205660,2
h1cr7mi,nx014g,You dont get to the top of a company like J&J and control the levels of power without being ruthless You have to think about this from their end Its a simple transaction The upper crust at J&J get new summer homes in the Hamptons and millions of plebs get colon cancer and die in agony You see how it balances out in the end? Oh wait you dont? Thats probably because you have a soul unlike whoever decided to knowingly sell asbestos tainted BABY powder for over 60 years! The fact that they can then push an experimental vaccine to a huge percentage of the public after this assault on our trust is so mind numbingly depressing for society I dont even want to think about it anymore,keanenk,16233763330,2
