ho28zkv,rdg5q3,I guess no one read the article; it makes a great point The problem is the child sex trafficking conspiracies are all fake Its worse than that Theyre blatant misinformation designed to win elections They say only Democrats are pedophiles yet we keep seeing the conservatives are often the ones getting caught with the children Theres pedophiles on both sides unfortunately These people even said Ruth Bader Ginsberg was a pedo when she was like 116 years old If you cant see though this as a blatant marketing campaign idk what to tell you other than you may need to work on your critical thinking Of course Ghislaine Maxwell and Epstein did fucked up shit That doesnt mean the world is ran by a bunch of Democrats who all have sex with kids and inject adrenochrome Its almost as if the people pointing their fingers are trying to get the heat off them Classic projection The GOP assumes that since they like to fuck little kids that everyone else is doing it too,jeremicci,16391849840,4
ho16sji,rdg5q3,So here is my take Ive been reading about satanic sex cults and Pizzagate for about 5 years But Ive really never been given any hard evidence that it all exists What I have found is that the Religious right is very obsessed with grouping sex workers and pornography with "sex trafficking of minors" into the same group this makes it a LOT easier to condemn all 3 and harder to fight against legislation that limits say strip clubs Because if a strip club is a possible "sex ring" then we cant be opposed to THAT right? My conspiracy theory is that the religious nazis are using sex trafficking as a front to go after sex workers and pornography thoughts?,wellmaybe24,16391689150,1
ho2utmd,rdg5q3,What I dont get about these sex trafficking stories is that they usually involve very rich men About 10 years ago I knew a Jewish guy in LA that was very rich He was a perv but he got much better women than Jeffrey He would just put ads on Craigslist for people that wanted a sugar daddy He got thousands of replies from all types of hot people From those he picked the hottest He consistently had very hot fwbs When he got tired of one hed get a new one The participants were all willing They loved the sugar Everything was legal I dont get why these rich guys dont just do that Why sex traffic when you can find hotter people by just being a sugar daddy? Even if they like the underage look They just look for women that are 18 but look underage Everytime I see one of jeffrey epsteins girls I wonder why hed sex traffic THAT They are not even that hot If all he wanted was sex orgies with super hot women all he needed to do was to supply sugar My friend got much hotter women from his Craigslist ads,Twiottle,16391950700,-1

he wrote a White House official that he was in favor of a "National Endowment in support of free institutions throughout the world" >The NED was initially placed under the auspices of the National Security Council and one Walter Raymond Jr a CIA propaganda expert who according to the late Robert Parry for years acted as liaison between the program and Casey Raymond also drew charming doodles like this depicting himself as a literal puppeteer controlling many different strings >The organization was stacked with prominent neoconservatives like Lane Kirkland John Richardson and Allen Weinstein Carl Gershman a longtime professional anticommunist was its first and so far only president One of its current board members Elliott Abrams is a war criminal with a history of subverting democracy overseas >To prevent the odor of US imperialism from contaminating the NEDs work the Reagan administration made it a private organization that in turn funded several more private institutions including the NDI and IRI But the fact that it was routinely staffed with former US officials and got its funding from the US government has always made this a dubious conceit >Equally dubious was the idea that its task was simply to promote democracy Two of its "core grantees"  which receive around 70 percent of its funding  are explicitly right wing: the IRI which is a GOP-led institution that once described its goals as advancing "democracy the rule of law and free-market economics"; and the Center for International Private Enterprise a project of the **US Chamber of Commerce** Even the Solidarity Center (formerly the Free Trade Union Institute) which is affiliated with the **AFL-CIO** went on to support conservative causes Only the NDI the Democrats arm could be said to be anywhere left of center Overall the NEDs track record tilts decidedly to the right CIPE and The Solidarity Center are two of the four grantees of the [NED](https://wwwsolidaritycenterorg/national-endowment-for-democracy-ned-ndi-iri-cipe-and-solidarity-center-welcome-increased-funding-from-congress/) NED does what the CIA used to do behind closed doors I thought the NED was pretty interesting considering Time Magazines story about the secret shadow campaign to save the [2020 election](https://timecom/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/) The article mentions multiple times how the group was working to protect and save Democracy (democracy is used ~33 times in the article) The article also outlines an alliance that included the AFL-CIO and the US Chamber of Commerce: >The pact was formalized in a terse little-noticed joint statement of the US Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO published on Election Day This article from [socialismcom](https://socialismcom/fs-article/betrayal-from-venezuela-to-iraq-the-afl-cio-and-the-national-endowment-for-democracy/) discusses how NED is a CIA front is funded by the US government and works closely with the leaders of the AFL-CIO: >A little-known far-right organization with a warm and fuzzy name the National Endowment for Democracy is up to no good in at least 40 countries That is bad enough especially given that the money for NEDs dirty deeds comes from working taxpayers courtesy of the US Congress Truly appalling however is the role that leaders of the AFL-CIO the largest US labor federation play in carrying out the work of this agency > A CIA front is born During the late 1970s the CIA was exposed for its active sabotage of numerous governments and progressive labor movements abroad Not so publicized was the AFL-CIOs role in aiding the CIA >Operating through the American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD) the AFL-CIO aided the overthrow of democratically elected governments in Guyana in 1963 Brazil in 1964 the Dominican Republic in 1965 and Chile in 1973 These are just a few examples of labor officialdoms shameful record in helping to carry out corporate-propelled US foreign policy >In 1983 after the CIA was widely discredited Ronald Reagans administration created a new agency the NED to take care of old business As an NED founder Allen Weinstein put it in 1991: "A lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA" >In his hard-hitting book Rogue State: A Guide to the Worlds Only Superpower William Blum describes some of the agencys activities "NED successfully manipulated elections in Nicaragua in 1990 and Mongolia in 1996 helped to overthrow democratically elected governments in Bulgaria in 1990 and Albania in 1991 and 1992 and was busy working in Haiti in the late 1990s on behalf of rightwing groups **NED like the CIA before it calls what it does supporting democracy** The governments and movements whom the NED targets call it destabilization" From the [Time 2020 election story:](https://timecom/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/) >"The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation" says Norm Eisen >The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation >The system didnt work magically Democracy is not self-executing" >And they believe the public needs to understand the systems fragility in order to ensure that democracy in America endures,Settlemente,16187557890,1

Barrs father wrote a sci-fi book about alien politicsgeo-political allegory that according to SNOPES "matter of factly" deals with the rape of young slaves https://wwwsnopescom/fact-check/bill-barr-jeffrey-epstein-book/ Heres an AP story where Barr calls the Epstein suicide "a perfect storm of screw-ups" and details some of the investigation (odd stick that he would use phrasing similarly to Q) https://wwwnbcnewscom/news/us-news/barr-calls-jeffrey-epstein-s-death-perfect-storm-screw-ups-n1089451 Bill Barr interviewed JEs last cellmate https://wwwbizpacreviewcom/2021/01/05/ag-bill-barr-personally-questioned-last-cellmate-of-jeffrey-epstein-before-alleged-suicide-source-says-1012813/ Bill Barr really wants us/US to believe Jeffrey killed himself And had some weird connections to JE And upon further timeline investigations seems to live and breathe DC https://videofoxnewscom/v/6031965836001#sp=show-clips Started in 73 with the CIA Almost 50 years later and this the dude that ruled it a "suicide",GlamSpell,16206584870,95

gxlsebc,n908zu,Ya I was on my honeymoon in greece(how I miss traveling) and my wife was like "hey that guy you always talk about killed himself" Reading the Epstein story is one big way to peer into what an intelligence agency asset is capable of doing Get jobs for no reason Get billions of dollars from no where Gather blackmail on politicians educators and corporations Be allowed to run the operation globally unchecked for 20+ years Then when the op is over your president who you have blackmail over arrest you and obviously fakes your death As soon as this massive blackmail operation ends the new phase of the agenda begins as a "pandemic" I wonder what his real name is and how many medals/awards he received for his commitment to a 20+ year long undercover operation Thats some serious dedication to a cause,ironlioncan,16206529220,9

Or anyone else since this was a criminal network Way too many people knew what was going on for so few to be held accountable The Clintons and Gates know they can always downplay accusations as conspiracy theory nonsense because no one will even investigate them which is pretty crazy when you consider the fact that we actually did haul him into a courtroom before over a stained dress Underage girls being trafficked in order to gain compromising evidence over politicians and other powerful people? Shit should be the permastory that Trump-Russia was for years being constantly covered and dug into (Funny that theres not an endless supply of secret govt sources giving the media juicy bits huh?)

hiaj2ss,qh1mh5,Amphetamine  Methamphetamine That methyl group makes your body metabolize it a whole lot differently and up its neurotoxic and addictive potential Although there literally is prescription methamphetamine (Desoxyn) its rarely prescribed Ive been on Adderall since I was 21 and it changed my life Ive been on and off it for years at a time due to insurance problems and I know when Im on it I am a better functioning human I have no idea on how I feel about children taking it Im kind of happy I started later in life,Yung-Fern,16353660730,1
hid9v3j,qh1mh5,I believe adderall has many benefits taken as prescribed for those who have ADHD I was the Ritalin generation which was prescribed to me It had its pros and cons My attention span increased and my grades were exponentially better Yet the side effects loss of appetite irritability cold sweats and depression were the reasons I stopped taking it I never did get prescribed adderall yet my boyfriend has been on it for several years He is 59 years old and takes it as prescribed with no ill side effects I have taken it before and I think its hugely helpful in focus I also think it has the ability to open parts of the mind for a person to see things in life they may never have seen because of all the distractions Its not surprising that the diagnosis rate from ADD has become so prevalent The world is full of things that are meant to distract Apps on cellphones and video games are purposefully filled with content that triggers the addiction part of the brain The creators are trying to get you hooked So I believe adderall is far less detrimental and may be beneficial at stopping the triggering effect of all the other manufactured distractions One more thing I want to say about ADD This condition is actually an asset As I have gotten older and learned behavior management I have good multi tasking skills can think outside the box and when I find something of interest I become hyperfocused and will not relent until I figure it out or finish People diagnosis with ADD are some of the most creative and forward thinking people I know,katiekat122,16354207410,1

i0zezv3,tg0kom,I posted this almost a year ago and have kept copying and pasting it because a lot of it has come true since then Ill warn you its long though This is a copy from another post but lines up the events of history that are being copied right now And why so many *Financial Issues* are being disguised (such as climate issues or pandemic issues) But a lot of this has happened before and is being full-on copied from other time periods and how even blackrock (the single largest hedge fund and called "The Fourth Branch of the US Government by Forbes and Bloomberg) [wrote the entire financial blueprint of what was going to happen before covid even started back in August 2019](https://wwwblackrockcom/corporate/literature/whitepaper/bii-macro-perspectives-august-2019pdf) Were seeing a complete system change why we needed to pump out a ton of money (literally 40% of all Dollars in existence were created in the last year) and why we need a WORLDWIDE unique Identification system tied to single individuals and a unique ID (a passport that is financial in its requirement but right now is being pushed through medical global requirements) Corona is a financial issue disguised as a pandemic issue because it can circumvent local laws and force the wordlwide laws Climate change is a financial issue being disguised as an ecosystem issue because again those laws are "bigger" than local laws and can circumvent normal procedures ----- We know "follow the money" to be the oldest and truest sense of deducing whats going on One of the things that stands out is that this event is following exactly the same events of the 20s and 70s Both times marked by huge inflation both times marked by a currency change and a new system and both times marked by a war that took place to get rid of the old system and expand the system while countries are hit hard by inflation But they all follow the same play ook = a massive amount of money was printed out and a certain assets price was then crashed that people were holding onto In the 20s-30s the asset was gold (whos price skyrocketed as money was printed and then crashed right before a market crash) and now with crypto currency (bitcoin was $7200 in january 2020 and got up to $60000 before crashing down to $32000 and flying back up to $65000 again and will probably crash even further once again before the final drop before it raises to crazy levels in ten years) In the case of gold the conspiracy is that two men formed a group and tried to corner the market and then the US released all its gold shares to crash that market and everyone sold their gold the US then used that price to buy gold from people and then backed the dollar with gold and even made owning it illegal alsoone of those two men who tried cornering the market was the Presidents brother in law so it was clearly a setup and a lot of people lost money but the US gained a lot of gold at cheaper prices right before switching the currency to be backed by gold So it was all about currency So why is the same thing happening again? August was the 50th year anniversary of Nixon ending the gold backed dollar in the 70s and starting the petro backed dollar So what does the end of the currency look like? Remember I said there was a crash for gold because the US released all its stores and crashed the market? Well guess [who owns the most bitcoin](https://wwwwiredcom/2013/12/fbi-wallet/)? Well for starters everyone will need a personal wallet (hence a vaccine passport for tracking is going to come sooner or later but this is the best excuse) The current chair of the SEC (Gary Gensler) who was installed in April taught a class about crypto currency at MIT Sloane (which is an enlightening resource if you want to see how officials view crypto currencies) He even talks about bitcoin finishing a 10 year testing phase and how it survived {what does that even mean? I thought Satoshi Nakamoto was an anonymous person I thought crypto was all about a decentralized financial platform and yet the current head of the SEC says it survived a testing phase?} So what else do we know signifies the end of the petro dollar? Weve all seen how much climate change pops up Well plastics are part of the oil system and thats part of the end too is my guess I know people think its an environmental factor for climate change but we all know that the biggest changes arent happening (a very tiny percentage accounts for the most pollutants but nothing is done about those) But following the money its clear that climate change is a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue This is extremely clear because two separate Senate and house committees met with banks in May about climate changewhy would they meet with banks instead of oil companies or manufacturers? Again the evidence points to a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue But theyre pushing us simply to change what system we consume while avoiding the largest climate change pollutants And even ending the oil system next is energy sourcingwell enter in Afghanistan popping up again and the Taliban/ISIS (which is where the largest lithium deposit is) But the key point is that we will move off of seaparate working grids (because even if you steal gasoline it still works on your vehicle) onto one grid that uses unique identification (which electrical vehicles already do but again is part of the movement away from the machine driven system and into the computer/tracking system) And what about the old infrastructure? Have you noticed how all those hacking attacks kept happening to old infrastructure key points? And the hackers keep asking other countries for huge amount of bitcoin? Have you noticed how war keeps popping up involving all those countries on the old system? Must be a complete coincidence Im sure But well know for sure this is the case if the market crashes soon Hyperinflation is close and technically happening but the FED refuses to acknowledge it (crazy how we dont vote for the FED president and yet they control the entire economy) Weve now had the largest 12 month increase in inflation since 1983 The CPI has changed over and over how inflation is measured true inflation is estimated anywhere from 13% - 25% (but you already know that and likely got your rent hiked already up 20% year-over-year) Thats what happened in the 30s right as they switched to a new backing for the dollar (with Gold) and were seeing all the signs present now that this is true If were about to end the machine driven age and start the computer driven stage then we would each need a unique wallet address and a passport can accompany that It would be the easiest way to install worldwide tracking (since crypto provides a ledger for everything) Also well know bitcoin prices will shoot through the roof after a crash if all this is true and happens Either way this ties corona (an excuse for mass printing of money) the vaccine (more money and a unique wallet tied to ID) end of petro dollar and machine age (climate change is a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue end of plastics from oil) end of the retail to stores system and move to full digital marketplace the beginning of the crypto dollar and crashing the crypto markets (already happened but still can drop much farther along with the rest of the market similar to exact same scenarios in the past) Were entering into the most tracked age of all time everything on the planet will be tracked back to unique ids and monitored on a blockchain/verified by a computer "The Great Reset" might sound like a conspiracy meme but thats an awful lot of coordination to happen in a short period of time Even better since I wrote this the IMF and 10 countries got together in Israel and [Simulated a Cyber Attack that would shut down the Global Financial System](https://financeyahoocom/news/exclusive-imf-10-countries-simulate-133015124html) Im sure thats just a coincidence too! Im sure once it happens everyone will be shocked and demand answersthat they already have Its coming my guess is at the start of Bidens second term since thats when they did it with Nixon Ill keep writing this and if Im wrong I will stop but weve been checking off each point from that paper by Blackrock ever since corona started Every company put money back into their company and was given a massive amount with the PPP loans and every country matched financial and monetary policies and was given massive amounts of money during corona Soif the market started showing signs of a massive failure in 2019 and this paper was put out in August 2019 and weve followed every item line by line of this outline since then and it came before coronathen what does that say about corona This was the single largest robbery in history and unless you are in the 1% then you are going to be the one paying for it You paid for it not just with two full years of your life hearing about this you didnt just pay by having communities torn apart or having to hear people argue about things that arent the actual problem you didnt just pay for it by having to actually stay in solitary confinement that includes the ability to watch your phone and the internetyou literally are going to actually pay for the rest of your life with the inflation costs and debt Well see if this is rightbut weve already checked off most the points from that paper The rich got so insanely rich since this happened It was literally the best year for Wall Street but how was it for most people?,garthsworld,16474938020,2

h9a3aa2,p5wmdj,Its not the fault of any one person As a country over 70% of us wanted to invade Afghanistan after 9/11 I was one of those people Until 2009 over 70% of us thought we should stay There are legitimate criticisms that can be leveled at Trump Biden Obama and Bush but it should not stop there We sent 2 trillion dollars of our money over there thousands of lives and altered life for countless American families But it all collapsed in 10 days No matter how bad the president is he isnt bad enough to be responsible for ineptitude on such a massive scale We knew there was a massive problem when we first began to train their soldiers International Security Assistance Force or better known as ISAF is where the major problem lies For one our military personnel quickly gave ISAF a new moniker "I suck at fighting" The majority of the recruits that joined the Afghan military were extremely poor recruits Take a look at this video of our troops training Afghans to do jumping jacks https://youtube/QdggP7rw0mg To be fair there were exceptions to this rule and some Afghans turned out to be great fighters The problem however is that they were few and far between The next issue is that all of this was thought up by a group of bureaucrats who played it like they would in any Western country To give ISAF "credibility" they sought out local "authorities" to sign on Those authorities were the mujiahdeen warlords These are the same warlords that started the Afghan civil war in the 90s So these warlords used ISAF as a piggy bank for the next 20 years Providing token compliance but nothing more This is all to say that our plans should have changed years ago We tried one strategy and it sucked but we couldnt admit we were wrong so we just kept pumping resources into it Im short Afghanistan is the sunk cost fallacy on a monumental scale Anyone responsible for propping this plan up are the real ones we need to blame Yes our presidents are in that group but they are far from the only ones,rhm54,16292019550,2

hv1n1ts,sh2zq9,Back in my day the "banned books" were the books on the school reading list and teachers would just refer to them as such so the kids would think they were edgy We even had "banned book week" and were all supposed to read To Kill a Mockingbird or something else that was controversial in the South 70 years ago I always thought that if a kid brought in The Turner Diaries or something by David Irving then the teachers would shit themselves,SnooStrawberries9414,16436634370,6

gw6iow2,n0evko,I dont give 2 shits about what a president says they aALL lie I care about what he does Trump presided over the greatest economy this country has ever known He had the lowest unemployment numbers across the board for every demographic except white men There were at least 4-7 million people that came off of welfare during his tenure He signed a tax cut that benefitted over 90% of the population that actually pays taxes He had illegal immigration to a trickle He had China on its heels and finally paying their share on imports and exports North Korea wasnt testing bombs Iran wasnt talking shit Put programs in place like operation warp speed to get a vaccine developed and to the public in less than a year which is unheard of And much more And were talking about a guy with 0 years of politics In comparison Biden who has been in politics for well over 40 years and what has he done besides grope kids in front of their fucking parents and smell womens hair oh and pretty much coerce Ukraine into firing a prosecutor that was investigating his fucking pedophile crackhead sons employment in an industry he had no knowledge of in a country he knows nothing about And dont forget to give "the big guy" his cutya know ;-) And theres people out there that really think that senile old fuck got 80 million votes,LordClaranceMcDonald,16196230910,1
hmgdleq,r45a5n,I remember when this was first discovered/posted on r/conspiracy back when she was arrested in 2020 and the account suddenly went dark It was fascinating to watch it come together in real time This information had better be a part of the prosecutions case in the trial Ill tell you why Im 99% sure personally that /u/maxwellhill was Lady Ghislaine herself I also am about 75% sure Aaron Swartz unearthed EVERYTHING related to Jeffrey&Ghislaine/Intelligence Agencies/human trafficking/political blackmail/Moloch when he hacked the MIT research lab which Jeffrey was a prominent associate of Aaron hacked the private servers there and found something he was NOT supposed to find and was soon charged with such extreme punishments by the court system which led to his suicide (I have no reason to think he was assassinated but of course it wouldnt surprise me Look up [the relationship between Courtney Love and her father/The Grateful Dead/CIA/MKUltra](https://covertactionmagazinecom/2021/07/21/u-s-intelligence-coverup-newly-declassified-fbi-file-on-nirvanas-kurt-cobain-compounds-evidence-implicating-his-wifes-role-in-his-murder/) Kurt was likely assassinated by these forces for being a political thorn in their side to a much lesser degree than Aaron was becoming Smart skilled young men who competently buck the system are their worst nightmare and must be *crucified*) Aaron died in 2013 and /u/maxwellhill IIRC showed up as a high level account around 2012 The SOPA/PIPA protests spearheaded by Aaron and others in his circle were around 2012 and their success put Aaron on the elites map in a bad way Then when he found whatever he found hacking MIT he became a HUGE problem for their scheme Poor kid probably had no idea what to do with himself 26 years old and to discover all this by yourself and to live with it alone? Think of the emotional trauma we have all endured in the last years as all this has come out and weve had each other to get through it all Aaron had no one He was probably absolutely fucked in the head/heart by the time he died You know maybe I dont know 100% if any of this is true But it sure does add up Also the McGraw-Hill textbook company (the makers of all our K-12 school history textbooks) is owned by the Maxwell family So /u/maxwellhill controls the narrative just as McGraw-Hill does Its a cute pun Ill give her that,umbertostrange,16381375500,124

i0dfu6d,tcdedn,I understand your sentiment so much suffering on both sides But Ukraine was invaded that is the difference Sadly the Russian people will suffer also because their leader is and insane narcissist But at least the Russians can sleep in their own beds and give birth in a hospital or drive down the street without worrying about being bombed The Russian people will suffer economically for years to come becuase of the action of their government but most will survive as will their countrys infrastructure The Russian people dont have to run in fear from their homes leaving everything sometimes even pets behind as they seek some sort of safety The Russian people dont have to flee on foot to other countries hoping someone will take pity on them and provide warmth food and shelter as they leave their sons and husbands behind Imagine those pregnant women in the hospital or the tiny babies in the NICU being rushed through rubble to a basement where nurses desperately try to keep them safe and alive with bombs dropping around them That is real terror Ukraine is being invaded and leveled only because one man wants the land But you are right in that both Ukrainian and Russian people are suffering but it is not equal levels of suffering Its ok to feel empathy and sadness for both no one is making you "love" one side and "hate" the other You can stand with Ukraine AND hate what Putin is doing to his own people I personally feel such pain for the Russians who have no idea whats going on and are losing access to money food even stuff that gets them through the day like McDonalds and video games Its not fair to the citizens Sanctions like that are meant to squeeze the citizens who would then put pressure on the government which in this case does not care one bit what happens to the millions of people they are tasked with looking after Its horrible and unfair to the Russians but Ukraine is not the one doing these things to the Russians Ukraine is simply trying to survive right now I think we can all agree that Putin and his corrupt government are the bad guy here yes? TL:DR: Its ok to feel sad for the citizens of both countries but there is clearly one Country who is the aggressor and one being mercilessly attacked But the average Russian citizen is not to blame and its ok to have empathy for them as well,thisistherightname,16470964080,1

h6bceli,oq0kxg,For those that complain of capitalism or communism or what not the real issue is the kid raising system Lets pretend you want to be a millionaire by 30 In a college system with $100k of debt starting at 22 you basically need to earn around $150k per year after taxes and expenses to get to $1 Mil by 30 if investments go well etc (about doubling) Now remove college all together Instead of $150k you need like $90k Now imagine you take a kid and instead of the asinine question what do you want to do (all girls : animals community kids environment all boys : outdoor guy what my dad did) - and instead say what do you want to have This is what I do They always want a nice car vs shit car They want a happy spouse with kids vs alone and desperate They want to be able to afford medicines vs bothering family with a go fund me Its a relatively easy decision; lots of money better There are actually a LOT of careers that pay $90k without a degree Now if you plan for this you get them as an apprentice BUT ONLY for careers that pay $60k base and $200k tops like computers legal finance media & medical I had a dancing girlfriend that became a doctor simply by working at Walgreens She of course had no concept of what being a doctor was but after the pharmacist kept giving her money driving a nice car and invited her to her nice house - boom she became a doctor (internally) It was easy But more to the point I got this trailer kid that I sponsored over a few years who will be making $60k at 18 in computers - all I had to do was pay him $100 or so at a time for computer work here and there roughly what I would have paid someone else He *might* be a millionaire by 30 working full time in computers at 18 with what is normally referred to as the best resume theyve seen - and thats even when he slacked off (his dad gets him drunk weekly and his aunt keeps telling him to spend the next several years getting high and going to music shows thats what life is about!) - I did help him start his own business but he never did the professional networking meetings I suggested And the Key to all this? Benjamin Franklins Autobiography!!! Seriously!!! In it is a quick self study guide (13 virtues) to teach you to not be a dick Then there is the Junto system to make you network and listen to others and learn from them share with them in a constructive way And the final piece of the Benjamin Franklin system was to teach kids (nephews in his day) your skills when they were about 15 Then invest in them enough to start a shop (like $20K say) Then they pay you 50% of profits the next several years In Franklins system he went from poor as fuck to worker (18) - $30k (in todays money) - to extremely good worker living healthy connected and disciplined - shop manager (21) $60k - But the kicker at 32 he invested in 3 nephews basically This is where he made all his money Those nephews were also printers like him By 37 he was retired - and most of his inventions & political involvement happened after 37 (1740) And it was Franklin *the most* responsible for the AM Revolution cause he taught people how to make a fuck ton of money basically (and not to be assholes - EI self governing) Meh dribble but if you do something similar to what the Swiss do today where the average professional salary *is actually* $200000 then ALL of economics solves itself But they force kids into smart apprenticeship programs at 15 Thats the biggest difference The good kids are in professional clubs by 17 This is 100% normal Making $60k out of a Swiss high school is absolutely the norm and the reason the main reason they have such immense wealth Literally every nation could copy this approach and not take away from anyone else but we dont for whatever reason but you should do so with your kids always,Bitcoin1776,16270878610,1
h6azoh2,oq0kxg,No one takes out 200k at 17 most of the people taking out that much in student loans are in medical/pharmacy/veterinary school possibly Graduate programs And are therefore not 17 more like 22-23 at that point after bachelors Most of these people are making 100-200k a year after residency and can easily pay off their loan if they were disciplined and/or financially literate and is a great RoR on the money borrowed and will not have difficulty finding employment The people loaning know this A business loan is a lot more risky most small businesses go out of business is the sad reality Undergraduate loans are another beast but at the same time there is an element of personal responsibility to consider here You have the ability to choose where you go you dont have to pay 40k a year to go to a private college when you can go to a college that is just as good for 10k You can go to community college for the first 2 years and save tons of money You can live off campus and work to pay rent and food and gas you dont have to get a housing loan At the end of the day you have a lot of control over how much you choose to borrow you also have control over what major you study and understanding the job market and what businesses are looking for those skills how you can market in the job place So when people complain about their huge undergrad loans and cant find a job well Im not saying the system isnt broken but there is an element of personal responsibility objectivity and neutrality that I feel needs to be embedded into this discussion,MissionIll0,16270811450,-1

I really do not remember in any history of a war undertaken with such combined injustice and baseness Ordinary wars of conquest are to me far less wicked than to go to war in order to maintain smuggling and that smuggling consisting in the introduction of a demoralizing drug which the government of China wishes to keep out and which we for the lucre of gain want to introduce by force; and in this quarrel are going to burn and slay in the pride of our supposed superiority  Thomas Arnold to W W Hull March 18 1840 http://wwwvictorianweborg/history/empire/opiumwars/opiumwars1html 3 https://webarchiveorg/web/20180311121505/https://sacuorg/opium2html See also Opium in China In 1997 the colony of Hong Kong was returned to China Hong Kong Island became a British possession as a direct result of the Opium War the opening shots of which were fired 150 years ago All Chinese regardless of political ideology have condemned this armed confrontation as an unjust and immoral contest As far as they are concerned Britians waging a war for the sake of selling a poisonous drug constitutes the most shameful leaf of human history In the hindsight provided by subsequent events in China it is perhaps easy to condemn this act of British aggression but it is less certain that the event was seen in the same condemnatory light by Chinese and foreign observers a century and a half ago 4 Article on opium trade in 1920s Shanghai http://streetsofshanghaipbworkscom/w/page/18638691/Opium Opium (yapian ) Shanghai was built on the opium trade Before the 1850s Shanghai was the terminal port for coastal opium traffic Shanghai was opened to foreign trade on November 11th 1843 and very soon afterwards Jardines (the biggest British company in China at the time) set up a branch there and hired Chinese compradors one of whom was solely concerned with the supervision of opium By 1845 the opium moving through Shanghai constituted almost half of all the opium imported into China In 1880 nearly 13000000 pounds of opium came into China mainly from India By 1900 imports declined because China was now producing an average of 45000000 pounds of opium per annum itself There were at least 15000000 Chinese opium addicts  in Chengdu there was one opium den for every 67 inhabitants of the city In Shanghai some foreign missionaries began to complain that their homes were almost entirely surrounded by opium dens behind bamboo fences The city had more than eighty shops where the drug was sold openly in its crude form and there were over 1500 opium housesThe owners of these establishments bought their supplies from three major opium firms in the International Settlement  the Zhengxia Guoyu and Liwei All three were owned by Swatow (Chaozhou) merchants who formed a consortium This consortium obtained its opium from four foreign merchant houses: David Sassoon & Co ED Sassoon SJ David and Edward Ezra 5 Opium financed British rule in India http://newsbbccouk/2/hi/south\_asia/7460682stm What did you discover in the course of your research? How big was the trade? Opium steadily accounted for about 17-20% of Indian revenues If you think in those terms \[the fact that\] one single commodity accounted for such an enormous part of your economy is unbelievable extraordinary How and when did opium exports out of India to China begin? The idea of exporting opium to China started with Warren Hastings (the first governor general of British India) in 1780 The situation was eerily similar to \[what is happening\] today There was a huge balance of payments problem in relation to China China was exporting enormous amounts but wasnt interested in importing any European goods That was when Hastings came up with idea that the only way of balancing trade was to export opium to China,shylock92008,16270047200,2
h67hnxn,opbmcz,IS ANYONE APOLOGIZING TO GARY WEBB? by Michael Levine (DEA-RET) Gary Webb just in case youve already forgotten him was the journalist who in a well researched understated article entitled "The Dark Alliance" linked the CIA supported Contras to cocaine and weapons being sold to a California street gang and ended up literally being hounded out of journalism by every mainstream news peddling organization in the Yellow Pages Even his own employer The San Jose Mercury piled on for the kill And guess what? The CIA finally admitted yesterday in the New York Times no less that they in fact did "work with" the Nicaraguan Contras while they had information that they were involved in cocaine trafficking to the United States An action known to us court qualified experts and federal agents as Conspiracy to Import and Distribute Cocainea federal felony punishable by up to life in prison To illustrate how us regular walking around non CIA types are treated when we violate this law while I was serving as a DEA supervisor in New York City I put two New York City police officers in a federal prison for Conspiracy to distribute Cocaine when they looked the other way at their friends drug dealing We could not prove they earned a nickel nor that they helped their friend in any way they merely did not do their duty by reporting him They were sentenced to 10 and 12 years respectively and one of them I was recently told had committed suicide I have spent three decades as a court qualified expert and federal agent and am not aware of any class of American Citizen having special permission to violate the law that we have been taxed over $1 trillion in the past two decades to enforce; the law that every politician bureaucrat and media pundit keeps telling us protects us against the most serious danger to American security in our historyThe interesting thing to me about the Webb article is that the CIA is provably (and now admittedly) responsible for much larger scale drug trafficking than Webb alleged or even imagined in his report In fact according to a confidential DEA report entitled "Operation Hun a Chronology" that I used as part of the proof to back up the undercover experiences detailed in my book The Big White Lie (optioned for a movie by Robert Greenwald Productions) the CIA was actively blocking DEA from indicting many members of the ruling government of Bolivia from 1980-83during a time period that these same people were responsible for producing more than 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States As CIA Inspector General Hitz himself stated before congress it was during this time period that Nicaraguan Contra supporters were buying large amounts of cocaine from these same CIA protected Bolivians Do you think Congress wants to see this proof? The gang that cant spy straight as they are known to my listeners and about whom President Lyndon Johnson once said "When Rich folks dont trust their sons with the family money they send them on down to the CIA" certainly did a lot more damage to this nation than for example computer company owner Will Foster who was sentenced to 93 years in prison for possession of 70 marijuana plants for medicinal use Of course true to their shifty sleazy form while admitting that they did aid and abet Contra drug trafficking they are now refusing to release their own final investigative report which details the damning proof The same report that CIA Inspector General Fredrick Hitz during February 1998 had promised congress and the American people was forthcoming "shortly" because as CIA Director George Tenet now claims CIA does not have enough money in its budget to properly classify it You believe that then I know an old guy with a beard named Fidel wandering the streets of South Miami with an Island about 90 miles off the coast for sale He says the money is for his retirement How you ask do they get away with it? Well for one thing mainstream media the so-called Fourth Estate does all it can to help During the Iran-contra hearings when Senators Kerry and Damato were making pronouncements before the Senate indicating that the CIA was involved with drug trafficking Katherine Graham the owner of The Washington Post addressed a class of CIA recruits at CIAs Langley headquarters in November 1988 by saying: "There are some things the general public does not need to know and shouldnt I believe democracy flourishes when the government can take legitimate steps to keep its secrets and when the press can decide whether to print what it knows" Apparently CIA protection of drug trafficking was among those secrets Thus it should have been no surprise to those CIA agent recruits when Washington Post reporter and drug expert Michael Itsikoff wrote that there was "no credible evidence" linking the CIA supported contras to cocaine trafficking at the same time very credible evidence was being heard by Senator Kerrys committee indicating that the Contras may have been the top purveyors of drugs to Americans in our historyNeither should it have been a surprise to anyone who heard her statement when mainstream media refused to print the news that Oliver North US Ambassador to Costa Rica Lewis Tambs and various top level CIA officers were banned from ever entering Costa Rica by Nobel Prize winning President Oscar Arias for drug running The drugs by the way all going to us Nor should it have been a surprise when Gary Webb was destroyed by mainstream media for doing nothing more or less than telling the truth as he found it And now while CIA admits their felonies to the press but refuses to release the proof and Janet Reno the head of the Obstruction of Justice Department has done the unprecedented by classifying her own departments investigation into CIA drug trafficking the partnership for a Drug Free America is spending $2 billion of our tax money on already-proven-fruitless anti-drug ads And where do you think the money goes? Answer: to every major media corporation on the big board Gary Webb my friend you are owed a huge apology But I doubt that youll get it Not in this lifetime,shylock92008,16270105150,2

1975) CIA Chief in Laos Theodore Shackly was in the drug business having contacts with the Opium Warlord Lor Sing Han and his followers Santo Trafficante acted as his buying and transporting agent while Richard Armitage handled the financial section with the Banks in Australia Even after the Vietnam War ended when Richard Armitage was being posted to the US Embassy in Thailand his dealings in the drug business continued as before He was then acting as the US government official concerning with the drug problems in Southeast Asia After 1979 Richard Armitage resigned from the US Embassys posting and set up the "Far East Trading Company" as a front for his continuation in the drug trade and to bribe CIA agents in Laos and around the world Soon after Daniel Arnold was made to handle the drug business as well as the transportation of arms sales Jerry Daniels then took over the drug trade from Richard Armitage For over 10 years Armitage supported his men in Laos and Thailand with the profits from his drug trade and most of the cash were deposited with the Banks in Australia which was to be used in buying his way for quicker promotions to higher positions Within the month of July 1980 Thailands english newspaper "Bangkok Post" included a news report that CIA agents were using Australia as a transit-base for their drug business and the banks in Australia for depositing transferring the large sum of money involved Verifications of the news report can be made by the US Justice Department with Bangkok Post and in Australia Other facts given herewith have been drawn out from out Secret Reports files so as to present to you of the real facts as to why the drug problem is being prolonged till today 3 Finally we sincerely hope in the nearest future to be given the opportunity to actively take part in helping the US government the Americans and people of the world in eradication and uprooting the drug problems I remain Yours Respectively Khun Sa Vice Chairman Thailand Revolutionary Council (TRC),shylock92008,16270028910,1

I t is now clear that this agreement began with the events described in THE BIG WHITE LIE; that the top drug traffickers in Bolivia then supplying virtually all the worlds cocaine-including Sonia Atala-were CIA assets that had to be protected from our deep cover probe Laura and I still have the proof of this that we used to back up the publication THE BIG WHITE LIE The same proof was later incorporated into other data backing up the publications of DEEP COVER and TRIANGLE OF DEATH [https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/](https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/) Our evidence-which congress has been craning its neck not to see- for instance shows clearly that during Operation Hun (the story in The Big White Lie) secret meetings were held with CIA and Justice Department wherein all indictments of top government officials in Bolivia were blocked We now believe this agreement began because of Operation Hun CIA had to hide the fact that they were supporting the people manufacturing virtually all the cocaine being produced in the world at that time In Deep Cover we showed that during Operation Trifecta-a highly successful deep cover probe into the top of the drug world in three countries (Panama Bolivia and Mexico) -Attorney General of the US Ed Meese found it necessary to warn the Attorney General of Mexico about DEAs case We (undercover DEA agents and Customs agents) found links between top US government officials and the people who murdered DEA agent Kiki Camarena that to this day go unexamined by our congress or anyone else In "TRIANGLE OF DEATH a work of "faction" we showed CIAs real-life involvement in the protection and creation of one of the most murderous criminal organizations to ever plague America an organization created by escaped Nazi fugitives under CIA protection-events occurring long before this alleged CIA Justice agreement And so the dance continues If anyone watched the CNN show you cannot have helped but notice the snickering on the part of Congressional chairman Porter Goss (an ex CIA officer) as congresswoman Maxine Waters spoke Now heres the reason why: Sources of mine who speak to me from inside this veil of secrecy out of conscience and because I am cheaper and more reliable than a psychiatrist have already told me the following: There is secret communication between CIA and members of the Congressional staff-one must keep in mind that Porter Goss the chairman is an ex CIA official- indicating that the whole hearing is just a smoke and mirror show so that the American people-particularly the Black community- can "blow off some steam" without doing any damage to CIA The CIA has been assured that nothing real will be done other than some embarrassing questions being asked That the hearings will result in the CIA receiving even a larger budget than the current $26 billion that they admit to One of the most distressing things for me a 25 year veteran of this business to listen to was when Congresswoman Waters said that the hearings were not about CIA officers being indicted and going to jail "That is not going to happen" she said Almost in the same breath she spoke of a recent case in Miami wherein a Venezuelan National Guard general was caught by Customs agents smuggling more than a ton of cocaine into the US Despite named CIA officers being involved in the plot as Congresswoman Waters stated the Justice Department will not tell her anything about the case because of "secrecy laws" No wonder chairman Goss was snickering She could not have played more neatly into CIA hands than to surrender before the battle was engaged For the entire existence of CIA they have gotten away with doing more damage to the American people than all our traditional enemies combined precisely because no one was ever prosecuted From the CIA protection of Nazi criminals from war crimes prosecution as they set up criminal organizations that preyed on America (Triangle of Death) to their lies to President Kennedy that dragged us into Bay of Pigs to their lies to President Johnson that dragged us into the Vietnam War to their creation of a pan Arab army of American hating drug trafficking terrorists during the Afghan War to the Church Commission hearings to MK-Ultra to the Bolivian Cocaine Coup ("The Big White Lie") to their protection of the worlds top cocaine traffickers as they laid waste to American streets (Deep cover) the CIA has acted exactly as Senator Frank Church once described them: "a runaway rogue elephantcompletely unresponsive to Congressthey (the CIA) have not only been unproductive they have been contra productive they have brought great shame on America" And the dance continues &#x200B;

hrfghyd,rwkj3w,The worst is yet to come My religion (Orthodox) had prophecies about this and so far around 8-9 of them came true (theres more but they are some smaller ones so I wouldnt mention them) The one that is yet to come true is the one saying "once the humanity is at the point of not knowing what to do as times are getting worse and no solutions are to be found antichrist will appear with a solution" (I tried to translate it as best as I could) Vaccines are proving as failing which is exactly what they want The time will come when they will say publicly that they no longer know what to do and how to deal with the pandemic Thats when a *certain person* will appear with a "solution" to end all problems and he will be throned in UN as the humanitys saviour I made this as brief as I could as it is rather complex and in order to truly understand and believe all this youd need to know a lot of backstory Another huge one said that "there will be a global pandemic before the end" (This one was told about 200-300 years ago iirc) We live in the end times sadly You may or may not believe me but Ive been following advices that my religion told me due to these prophecies and I havent regretted a single decision I made thus far Ive simply been following prophecies and what they tell us to do and Im making it work Havent and wont take the vax as I know what it is leading towards,HRCK0,16414291920,2

Last month my husband lost his job of 10 years He had had been their model employee the golden boy so to speak Operating heavy equipment was just so natural for him and he had not ever Been written up or had one accident in the 10 years he was there Once when the company had been slacking and hadnt put rails on all the equipment my husband was blown off and landed directly on his neck breaking two vertebra He didnt even think of suing of seeking retribution he loved his job and it was good to us he said Well ultimately he was dismissed amidst a swarm of lawyers at the beginning of December The kids are seniors and we plan to leave Colorado after graduation for a more free state Still we have never thought even twice that getting the jab was even a option Everything concerning this vaccine has been unnatural since the beginning how did people not see this?  Hardship isnt over but we got this :) PS I couldnt say my whole family because my oldest that served in the Navy and is just in the reserves now was scared of the threats they gave and got vaccinated I cried and cried that day ,aliah358,16413881250,5

Now 1 month later they send her another threat and it is obvious that they didnt even READ her justification and are now only accepting an excuse directly from a doctor! They are also ONLY listing allergies to the vaccine as a medical excuse I know she is scared to death Ive heard her balling her eyes out asking her superiors at the company to speak up for her and advocate They are all too afraid to be viewed as "antivaxxer" themselves and have done nothing to help her so far Dont want to piss off daddy tech These superiors also had NO IDEA that this mandate was even in place at the company They knew nothing about these threats being sent to unvaccinated workers She is the top performer in her team This is the best job she has ever had by far and she is scared to death of losing it To the point where she is now thinking of getting the vaccine even though she knows it is highly risky for her health in particular! She has done everything right to justify not getting the vaccine and they are completely ignoring her! If anyone in the US knows of any recourse we could take against this measure please tell me! I know that this is illegal and the courts will MAYBE eventually side with basic fucking ethics but she cant wait for that At the end of this month she will be vaccinated or unemployed all so she can continue working from home around nobody else Again if anyone has advice please give itand keep in mind the company is stonewalling her and not even answering her questions,billyjk93,16414124040,1

h4wj858,oibtiu,BOOM Our government has its priorities fucked Up IMO And thats obvious and has been for decades They are more worried about controlling the people and making sure theyre secrets and crimes dont come to light Some of these people have been in congress 30+ years And youve never heard of them Wanna know why?

h4x1ngf,oibtiu,I agree that you shouldnt be required to purchase anything for the right to vote However who doesnt have an ID in 2021? Seriously what can you do without an ID? You need an ID to get a job get healthcare (private insurance or Medicaid) get government assistance buy cigarettes or alcohol drive a car buy a car get a mortgage rent a house or apartment and the list goes on and on Before people start talking about poor rural people I live in rural MS and in my 45 years I honestly cant recall anyone who doesnt have an ID My grandmother never drove a car in her life and she had an ID I grew up in a very poor county that was predominantly black and I know some people who would slap the taste out of your mouth for even implying that they were too backward to get an ID So every time a politician gets up talking about how some people are too poor or too dumb to get an ID I instantly know that they have no idea what theyre talking about If that really is the case then heres a novel idea fund a nationwide campaign to make government-issued Ids free But you wont see them doing that or even suggesting it #nocommensenseinwashington,HighMaint,16260962850,1

hx76r25,st9i06,Yeah because the protesting of those measures was never even remotely political in nature until recently Taking ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine is not taking a stand against the government overreach for the vaccine due to principle its saying "La La La I cant hear you" and then flipping the bird to any semblance of principles OP is unironically calling people brainwashed sheep lmfaooooo This sub has gone full-on "fuck the libs" and is mindlessly parroting talking points from people like that then has the stunning arrogance to call people sheep (even if they still disagree with all of the government overreach) because theyre vaccinated against the deadliest pandemic in 100 years,hashtagswagfag,16450335200,1
h6pkkef,osmlz4,the conspiracy here is that after 9/11 they said it will help find terrorist in airports and alot of frightened confused sheeps said "YES TAKE MY FREEDOM GIVE MORE POWER TO GOVERNMENT WE WANT TO BE HARRESSED" &#x200B; over the years we seen nothing but perversion from the TSA and yet this news article will not wake up people to what this fake agency is doing - intimidate citizens and instill FEAR in the minds of all travelers,xkingxkaosx,16273956450,154

h6q11v7,osmlz4,I remember an article a couple years ago where it showed the dollars per life calculations done by the government for the various post 911 stuff Locking cockpit doors was #1 at like $1000 and the TSA was last at like a billion dollars a person I still stand by that all new planes should have the cockpit completely separate from the passengers Then just git rid of security all together,cobolNoFun,16274031210,25

h6rv9lh,osmlz4,TSA was just a scheme from the beginning Have you seen how often TSA fails to catch weapons?

hvkh0g5,skbxuh,I really wish that layman would take the time to properly contextualize what "science" actually means in humanitys quest in understanding the universe The reason scientists dont listen to this "argument" is because its the same level of "insightfulness" that fledgling scientists in their first few years of Uni have Those students who are struggling to come to terms with the shock and betrayal (or a full blown existential crises) due to their naive expectations for what answers science can actually provide or not "Arguments" like these are just you choosing to throw the baby out with the bath water because you think youre ahead of the scientists but youre not Youre the same level of naive as the people screaming at you that science is the end all be all But then again I guess this is mostly a debate between layman so you have to speak at each others level I do like that (almost) the whole world -regardless of education- now has the opportunity to think about the philosophy of knowledge and science but I just worry that its being tainted with politics and inflammatory reactions that there isnt enough meaningful introspection,Tachy0n4,16439870870,3
