ho1fm7h,rdg5q3,If anyone thinks that child sex trafficking is fake news then you havent been paying attention to what happens every year in our country and the poorest countries around the world! These people prey on the poor just as they abuse them for work they also use them for their own devious purposes! This is as old as our history MEN have sought out the vulnerable and taken advantage of them and abused them for whatever purpose they wanted! As a survivor of this type of destructive behavior it has taken me a long time to realize that it wasnt my fault but it breaks you down piece by piece until you start self medicating and then you are deemed a delinquent though the judges and lawyers know what happens when a child is thrust into something like this they have no compassion for the children they add abuse on top of the abuse! We have tried to bury this stuff for too long and it is time for those who are elected to protect and serve have to be held accountable and forced to start doing their job! I could tell all of the heart wrenching stories but it will not help to change some of the peoples minds that are in charge! The only time that they come close to caring is when it happens to a child of status and even then they try to bury it! They have the money to pay off the officials in the right places and it just keeps happening! I spent most of my life with anger and self medication and it hasnt really been much help I hope that this is a start to holding them accountable maybe this one woman will open the door for all to see just how pervasive this really is but she is going to have to draw a roadmap to how these people do the things they do!

Even if they like the underage look They just look for women that are 18 but look underage Everytime I see one of jeffrey epsteins girls I wonder why hed sex traffic THAT They are not even that hot If all he wanted was sex orgies with super hot women all he needed to do was to supply sugar My friend got much hotter women from his Craigslist ads,Twiottle,16391950700,-1

guq7l4g,ms2o0d,I didnt appreciate how destructive private healthcare is until I got epilepsy If I had to pay out of pocket for the years of tests and hospitalizations Ive had I would quite literally be on the street Having chronic medical issues feels unfair enough in the first place If it had me in debt for life on top of that I would lose my mind Sure universal healthcare can be slow as fuck sometimes but it wont cost you your home,mozzarella_lavalamp,16185832420,110
guqfr1c,ms2o0d,What gets me its a couple things about how the system is fucked 1- we tax payers give grant money to smaller pharmaceutical companies The big companies dont want to do research and make medicine for very specific diseases that are rare and only affect a smaller pool of the population they want big net many fish So these smaller companies know this so they know they only way they can compete Id by looking for what disease is getting ignored/not being addressed directly so that becomes their niche But they dont have the money so they get a grant from the government This boosts their budget they increase employment and research and voila theyve created a treatment Now here comes the bigger pharmaceutical companies they see the need medicine and buy out the smaller company They then in turn self the new product at an outrageous price Talk about a winning scenario All you got to do is wait for a smaller company to get grant money do all the work and just buy them So we as tax payers pay to have these medicines made just to then pay for them at a steeper price and we dont get the grant money back 2- There is so much money in lobbying from Pharmaceutical companies (#1 lobbying industry by far) that they were able to convince Congress to vote against themselves being able to negotiate Medicare pharmaceutical prices with those companies A major reason these companies love America is because every other first world country has a system in place to make sure prices dont get out of hand We are their cash cow 3- Along with the pharmaceutical industry the health insurance industry (another top lobbying industry) is also a giant racket that takes advantage of us all These companies have done an amazing job to label things like universal healthcare as "socialist" and yea it might be but they dont care about that they just want you to be afraid of it because it would lead to them losing money The other thing that gets me is people who say "I dont want to pay for your insurance" thing is you already do we already do When an uninsured person goes to the ER they have to be treated When they cant pay the hospital gets that money through the insured by up charging everything Healthcare shouldnt be a for profit business at least to a point Healthcare doesnt fit the traditional supply and demand economic model of capitalism because the demand is always going to be high People are willing to spend whatever it takes to be alive You cant put a price on your life and theres companies know this Need a new heart? Well there isnt a discount store for that heres your bill Need life saving insulin? Well pay our prices because we convinced the government its illegal to go to Canada for 1/10 the price Healthcare and medicine shouldnt be political We put the most into our broken system than any other country and we get the least out of it All we have to do is follow the money and see whos profiting because odds are theyre the ones who stand to lose the most by changing the system Its the same thing with all the sentiment against renewable energy Whos profiting now and whos going to lose out by going to renewable energy?

he wrote a White House official that he was in favor of a "National Endowment in support of free institutions throughout the world" >The NED was initially placed under the auspices of the National Security Council and one Walter Raymond Jr a CIA propaganda expert who according to the late Robert Parry for years acted as liaison between the program and Casey Raymond also drew charming doodles like this depicting himself as a literal puppeteer controlling many different strings >The organization was stacked with prominent neoconservatives like Lane Kirkland John Richardson and Allen Weinstein Carl Gershman a longtime professional anticommunist was its first and so far only president One of its current board members Elliott Abrams is a war criminal with a history of subverting democracy overseas >To prevent the odor of US imperialism from contaminating the NEDs work the Reagan administration made it a private organization that in turn funded several more private institutions including the NDI and IRI But the fact that it was routinely staffed with former US officials and got its funding from the US government has always made this a dubious conceit >Equally dubious was the idea that its task was simply to promote democracy Two of its "core grantees"  which receive around 70 percent of its funding  are explicitly right wing: the IRI which is a GOP-led institution that once described its goals as advancing "democracy the rule of law and free-market economics"; and the Center for International Private Enterprise a project of the **US Chamber of Commerce** Even the Solidarity Center (formerly the Free Trade Union Institute) which is affiliated with the **AFL-CIO** went on to support conservative causes Only the NDI the Democrats arm could be said to be anywhere left of center Overall the NEDs track record tilts decidedly to the right CIPE and The Solidarity Center are two of the four grantees of the [NED](https://wwwsolidaritycenterorg/national-endowment-for-democracy-ned-ndi-iri-cipe-and-solidarity-center-welcome-increased-funding-from-congress/) NED does what the CIA used to do behind closed doors I thought the NED was pretty interesting considering Time Magazines story about the secret shadow campaign to save the [2020 election](https://timecom/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/) The article mentions multiple times how the group was working to protect and save Democracy (democracy is used ~33 times in the article) The article also outlines an alliance that included the AFL-CIO and the US Chamber of Commerce: >The pact was formalized in a terse little-noticed joint statement of the US Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO published on Election Day This article from [socialismcom](https://socialismcom/fs-article/betrayal-from-venezuela-to-iraq-the-afl-cio-and-the-national-endowment-for-democracy/) discusses how NED is a CIA front is funded by the US government and works closely with the leaders of the AFL-CIO: >A little-known far-right organization with a warm and fuzzy name the National Endowment for Democracy is up to no good in at least 40 countries That is bad enough especially given that the money for NEDs dirty deeds comes from working taxpayers courtesy of the US Congress Truly appalling however is the role that leaders of the AFL-CIO the largest US labor federation play in carrying out the work of this agency > A CIA front is born During the late 1970s the CIA was exposed for its active sabotage of numerous governments and progressive labor movements abroad Not so publicized was the AFL-CIOs role in aiding the CIA >Operating through the American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD) the AFL-CIO aided the overthrow of democratically elected governments in Guyana in 1963 Brazil in 1964 the Dominican Republic in 1965 and Chile in 1973 These are just a few examples of labor officialdoms shameful record in helping to carry out corporate-propelled US foreign policy >In 1983 after the CIA was widely discredited Ronald Reagans administration created a new agency the NED to take care of old business As an NED founder Allen Weinstein put it in 1991: "A lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA" >In his hard-hitting book Rogue State: A Guide to the Worlds Only Superpower William Blum describes some of the agencys activities "NED successfully manipulated elections in Nicaragua in 1990 and Mongolia in 1996 helped to overthrow democratically elected governments in Bulgaria in 1990 and Albania in 1991 and 1992 and was busy working in Haiti in the late 1990s on behalf of rightwing groups **NED like the CIA before it calls what it does supporting democracy** The governments and movements whom the NED targets call it destabilization" From the [Time 2020 election story:](https://timecom/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/) >"The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation" says Norm Eisen >The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation >The system didnt work magically Democracy is not self-executing" >And they believe the public needs to understand the systems fragility in order to ensure that democracy in America endures,Settlemente,16187557890,1

Each when viewed dispassionately and in isolation are terrible outcomes - an innocent man lost his life on one hand and rampant child exploitation on the other One caused by police the other caused by an elite group of dirty fucks operating in secret Due process required in BOTH cases But it sure does seem that the MSM loves pedos,1159,16190541040,16

gwmpirj,n2nxhj,The totality of evidence surrounding Private Johnsons execution-style murder strongly suggests that the person who killed her is former four-star Army General **Kevin P Byrnes** He was third in seniority among the Armys eleven generals at the time Byrnes who was appointed to his command position by President George W Bush in November 2002 headed the Armys Training and Doctrine Command (1st Cavalry Division) or TRADOC command In this capacity Byrnes supervised the recruitment and academic programs at thirty-three Army schools from basic training to the war colleges Private Johnson met General Byrnes in July 2005 just a couple of days before her death As fate would have it Private Johnson wrote his name in her personal notepad and told her father about her one-on-one conversation with him She had no way of knowing at the time that Byrnes (a) was engaged in an extramarital affair with a civilian female and (b) had been ordered by **General Peter J Schoomaker** the Armys Chief of Staff to end the affair Byrnes who was married willfully disobeyed Schoomakers order and instead elected to make his love affair more clandestine In doing so Byrnes risked being court-martialed for disobeying Schoomakers lawful and direct order Extramarital affairs among military generals while strictly prohibited by the military are not unusual Sometimes these affairs lead to reckless impulsive and even criminal conduct as the participants do everything within their power to indulge in the affairs under a cloak of secrecy The torrid love affair between **General David Petreaus** and his lover **Paula Broadwell** is a recent high profile example of this type of deceitful reckless conduct and criminal conduct Like Petreaus General Byrnes TRADOC command gave him the means and opportunity to practice the deception that accompanied his adultery Like Petreaus Byrnes found ways to evade the Pentagons scrutiny of his extramarital affair particularly after Byrnes was ordered to stop his affair Byrnes illicit love affair came to light only after his unanticipated encounter with Private Johnson caused its exposure During the early morning hours of July 19th Private Johnson inadvertently encountered General Byrnes engaging in the very romance he had been ordered to stop She was alone at the time because the Army never assigned Private Johnson a "battle buddy" to accompany her around the base Private Johnsons discovery of Byrnes continued adultery left him startled afraid and desperate Byrnes snapped and became violent toward Private Johnson who did not fight back because she was as shocked as he was and because Byrnes was her TRADOC commander During his assault on Private Johnson Byrnes knocked some of her teeth backwards broke her nose fractured her neck and inflicted other serious injuries on her body Private Johnson was then dragged into a contractors tent where Byrnes staged the crime scene to make it look like Private Johnson had committed suicide,jdhyp13,16199356390,5

h2m38om,o543q5,Hey Fuck banks I had an account with SunTrust and some of their policies were straight up scams The one that got me was how they dont accept deposits after 9pm but they will absolutely clear pending charges at all times of the night So when I deposited cash through the ATM the deposit didnt clear into morning But some pending charges all went through at night which overdrafted my account But then also the overdraft fee comes out before the deposit Another good one Your "current balance" in their app can be totally inaccurate Ive had them tell me this The current balance may not always be accurate So you have to keep track yourself Then what good is your stupid app? And my favorite conspiracy theory on banks? I swear banks intentionally hold pending charges when your account gets below a certain point And wait until you make another purchase Then bam! Send all the pending charges through at once overdrafting your account with the last purchase I cant prove this but Ive seen charges sit pending in my account for 2-3 weeks Then all go through all at once after I use my debit card thinking the charges have cleared And another conspiracy theory How do we know banks arent skimming fractions of pennies from every charge from every customer?

gwfrqxh,n1sfuh,I love that this sub deals with the conspiracies in plain view! So cool to see people in this mindset - that our economic and political system is a kind of open-air conspiracy I heard Snowden said something to this effect recently - that the biggest conspiracies are in plain sight The whole idea that we have to stick to the status quo that change is threatening this is like the Matrix that keeps us all trapped as collaborators with the powers principalities and archons who wield power from behind the scenes\* \*As Tracy Jordan said in the early 2000s sitcom 30 Rock "the government is injecting HIV into our chicken nuggets -- thats a metaphor!!" At the deepest level I dont believe in the dichotomization of mankind into three categories: (1) Mentally enslaved peasants who see a facade world (2) Elite rulers who understand the real workings of power and (3) enlightened sages who operate outside the system In reality I think were all more like the mentally enslaved peasants Human rationality is pretty limited and it burns insane amounts of calories time and effort to engage with any aspect of reality No one can do it for long People who have political and social power are lucky freaks who have latched onto some heuristics that work (for the moment) They dont really know whats going on either Their power wont last forever and their hurtful choices are often the product of their being as limited and finite as the rest of us Human society looks (to me) like a weird churn of groups of people rising and falling - like a chaotic washing machine Randos figure it out (like the Romans) they rise then they fall as their systems break or their principles become outdated and new groups rise (like Visgoth invasion of Roman Empireand the eventual emergence of the Feudal societythen the consolidation of Church powerand then the fragmentation of the Church and the rise of the nation state) Today we see it in the US The tumbling has made {China United States} {Amazon Google Facebook Haliburton Skynet} {the CIA The Democratic Party & Republic Party} these incredible locuses of power at their respective levels which crudely co-exist in a tense dynamism that is always tumbling around equilibrium But they wont last forever - someday Jeff Bezzos will be dead and the robot or clone they trot out as proof of his immortality will be only nominally Jeff Bezzos Amazon will be a footnote in history the CIA will be gone replaced probably by something even weirder Even the United States will dissolve or be invaded by a foreign power or slide into irrelevancy (perhaps along with the nation-state itselfheres hoping that the era of large-power wars is over and the nation state will slide into irrelevance opening the gates for more and more independent communities and expanding the possibilities for human freedom without bringing about decentralized forms of micro-slavery) Even within any given community theres an unstable hierarchy Join a Church get a corporate job or join a professional organization even in a seemingly flat and parodical organization like your local chapter of Hash House Harriers you still see that theres a churn of people at the top and people not And even seemingly smart or lovable or hard-working folks cant guarantee their spot forever All any of us can do is keep grinding away in our search for truth and goodness trying to be better asking the Benevolent Higher Power(s) for aide and assistance helping others rinse wash and repeat What a world We are lucky to be here If we are,DoktorSpengler,16197978280,2

gv4vq22,mu01bz,I bet one could change the statistical likelihood of mass shootings by adjusting what we see in our news feeds If you went through the view history of the people that ended up commiting past mass shootings it would probably validate this belief I dont think they can necessary choose who will shoot what To a degree its up to chance but I bet you gun violence is more associated with how often a person sees news articles of mass shootings than it is to access to guns I also dont doubt that a tech company if they wanted to could use user phone data to know what personality types are most susceptible to this influence and could adjust those peoples feeds accordingly Humans are pretty simple;monkey see monkey do If they can use an advertisement to make a percentage of the population more likely to eat stake then they could use one to make them more likely to go on a shooting The media attention the crying parents the name in the news paper Every time I click on my newsfeed Im bombarded by news articles It looks almost like positive re-enforcement In theory I dont doubt they could double or triple the mass shooting rate at any moment they want Now would any entity have the balls to do this? I dont know I just know it could be done Remember though its not really as common as it seems on tv Even if they could double or triple the rate you are still much more likely to be effected by smoking or heart disease All they would need is two or three separate instances a week to influence the psyche of the nation,FailOsprey,16188707140,1

h88st99,p0j98z,The world is like a ride in an amusement park and when you choose to go on it you think its real because thats how powerful our minds are The ride goes up and down around and around it has thrills and chills and its very brightly colored and its very loud and its fun for a while Many people have been on the ride a long time and they begin to wonder "Hey is this real or is this just a ride?" And other people have remembered and they come back to us and say "Hey dont worry; dont be afraid ever because this is just a ride" And we  kill those people "Shut him up! Ive got a lot invested in this ride shut him up! Look at my furrows of worry look at my big bank account and my family This has to be real" Its just a ride But we always kill the good guys who try and tell us that you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok  But it doesnt matter because its just a ride And we can change it any time we want Its only a choice No effort no work no job no savings of money Just a simple choice right now between fear and love The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors buy guns close yourself off The eyes of love instead see all of us as one Heres what we can do to change the world right now to a better ride Take all that money we spend on weapons and defenses each year and instead spend it feeding and clothing and educating the poor of the world which it would pay for many times over not one human being excluded and we could explore space together both inner and outer forever in peace,QuotesBillHicks,16284780350,29

h88guas,p0j98z,Mental illness is rising for 2 reasons 1) better identification and more diverse diagnostic criteria Back in the day your cousin was just "melancholic" rather than clinically depressed Thankfully weve moved to a more person centred therapy model for the most part that can identify increments of disorder 2) we love in a post capitalism hellscape where children are forced to run lemonade stands to pay for their insulin Non-clinical depression could be reduced dramatically if people were provided with more money less pressure and more time for self care But an exhausted and overstressed population has no energy to fight So were kept perpetually in crisis so were to scared to want change Covid probably threatened this balance more than any other event in recent history because our leaders *needed* to act or theyd be seen as incompetent and the only clear course of action gave many people a chance to relax recharge and see how much better the world could be Yes there was increased stress but after seeing how it could have been handled weve all started to realise how ripped off weve been for decades Thats why Ill never understand this idea that Covid is some tool of control its actually quite the opposite The more effective tool of control has been the squashing of critical thinking skills and the advanced propaganda techniques surrounding conspiracies Global elites can now hide anything in a conspiracy because theres a conspiracy about everything I think they learnt this around the 911 conspiracy time If left unchecked conspiracies get wilder and weirder until none of it seems plausible They just need whatever their doing to be on the bottom end of believable and well create the smoke screen for them by talking about lizard people and sacrificial children magic,Valor816,16284716440,1

h1qdgrf,nzlzfq,Youre absolutely right but its a much more extensive issue that your post taps into: namely the way that the environmental movement (and all of the various environmental groups like Greenpeace) was hijacked by corporations to push the global warming narrative which has completely overshadowed every other environmental issue for activists and which pins the blame on workers and lower classes and lets the corporations escape blame justice or all responsibility for cleaning up the damage they have done to the planet It started with the Thatcher government in the UK she deliberately funded research to prove carbon emissions had a negative impact so that she could break the backs of the coal miners who were striking It was a deliberate strategy to completely destroy organized labour and it worked and her counterpart in USA Ronnie Ray-Gun was busy doing the same thing dismantling any corporate controls and regulations while simultaneously destroying organized labour Both were agents of the new corporate tyranny The Gilets Jaunes movement in France encapsulates this perfectly: how its a class issue and how the global warming legislation hurts working class people Environmental Activists used to protest major corporations and financial institutions and government institutions nuclear power plant protests factory farms oil refineries hijacking pipelines etc but what happened with this psyop is that the shift led to the faux activism of Greta and Extinction Rebellion (which again attacks working class people by blocking them from going to work etc) which mostly replaced and distracted from the real issues The entire debate has been reframed with "deniers" on one side and on the other side if you care about the environment then you affirm the official narrative and therefore agree with the laws Both sides are incorrect because the entire framing is incorrect The way I approach it is I simply focus on the more existential and urgent environmental issues like microplastics in every living being on the plant for instance and 99% of the time these are the direct result of multinational corporations So take the environmental position but just sidestep the framing and address the real issues: nobody can attack you for actually caring about the environment and instead of getting distracted by entangling yourself in the pro or con global warming game just step back and realize its a psyop People are being pushed to fear something that isnt concretely evident to them a narrative that isnt intuitive (the idea that carbon which is necessary for plants is dangerous and an existential threat -- which by the way Im neither affirming nor denying Im simply stating that you cant see it with your own eyes so it becomes a "trust the experts" issue) while the things that are concretely evident like plastic pollution are being demoted to the bottom of the concern list But people can see with their own eyes the way that giant corporations are destroying the planet The evidence is overwhelming Now the next step is to realize that this exact same formula and process applies to every other major issue from war to immigration Start with the shift from class to race/ identity: From 2008-10 there was mass mobilization of workers and activism focused on class (the 99% vs the 1%) where the masses were joining together and attacking wallstreet and giant corporations So again we see the exact same pattern: the Occupy movement being hijacked and overshadowed by BLM and LGBTQ identity politics and also the exact same formula applies to the Covid-19 narrative and the risks and dangers of the virus and also the vaccine The MO is the same (and it also happened in the 60s with COINTELPRO) Its crystal clear once you put it together Chomskys Manufacturing Consent outlines the Modus Operandi for all of these propaganda and psyop campaigns pushed through by corporate media,FruitFlavor12,16236799210,53

i0zezv3,tg0kom,I posted this almost a year ago and have kept copying and pasting it because a lot of it has come true since then Ill warn you its long though This is a copy from another post but lines up the events of history that are being copied right now And why so many *Financial Issues* are being disguised (such as climate issues or pandemic issues) But a lot of this has happened before and is being full-on copied from other time periods and how even blackrock (the single largest hedge fund and called "The Fourth Branch of the US Government by Forbes and Bloomberg) [wrote the entire financial blueprint of what was going to happen before covid even started back in August 2019](https://wwwblackrockcom/corporate/literature/whitepaper/bii-macro-perspectives-august-2019pdf) Were seeing a complete system change why we needed to pump out a ton of money (literally 40% of all Dollars in existence were created in the last year) and why we need a WORLDWIDE unique Identification system tied to single individuals and a unique ID (a passport that is financial in its requirement but right now is being pushed through medical global requirements) Corona is a financial issue disguised as a pandemic issue because it can circumvent local laws and force the wordlwide laws Climate change is a financial issue being disguised as an ecosystem issue because again those laws are "bigger" than local laws and can circumvent normal procedures ----- We know "follow the money" to be the oldest and truest sense of deducing whats going on One of the things that stands out is that this event is following exactly the same events of the 20s and 70s Both times marked by huge inflation both times marked by a currency change and a new system and both times marked by a war that took place to get rid of the old system and expand the system while countries are hit hard by inflation But they all follow the same play ook = a massive amount of money was printed out and a certain assets price was then crashed that people were holding onto In the 20s-30s the asset was gold (whos price skyrocketed as money was printed and then crashed right before a market crash) and now with crypto currency (bitcoin was $7200 in january 2020 and got up to $60000 before crashing down to $32000 and flying back up to $65000 again and will probably crash even further once again before the final drop before it raises to crazy levels in ten years) In the case of gold the conspiracy is that two men formed a group and tried to corner the market and then the US released all its gold shares to crash that market and everyone sold their gold the US then used that price to buy gold from people and then backed the dollar with gold and even made owning it illegal alsoone of those two men who tried cornering the market was the Presidents brother in law so it was clearly a setup and a lot of people lost money but the US gained a lot of gold at cheaper prices right before switching the currency to be backed by gold So it was all about currency So why is the same thing happening again? August was the 50th year anniversary of Nixon ending the gold backed dollar in the 70s and starting the petro backed dollar So what does the end of the currency look like? Remember I said there was a crash for gold because the US released all its stores and crashed the market? Well guess [who owns the most bitcoin](https://wwwwiredcom/2013/12/fbi-wallet/)? Well for starters everyone will need a personal wallet (hence a vaccine passport for tracking is going to come sooner or later but this is the best excuse) The current chair of the SEC (Gary Gensler) who was installed in April taught a class about crypto currency at MIT Sloane (which is an enlightening resource if you want to see how officials view crypto currencies) He even talks about bitcoin finishing a 10 year testing phase and how it survived {what does that even mean? I thought Satoshi Nakamoto was an anonymous person I thought crypto was all about a decentralized financial platform and yet the current head of the SEC says it survived a testing phase?} So what else do we know signifies the end of the petro dollar? Weve all seen how much climate change pops up Well plastics are part of the oil system and thats part of the end too is my guess I know people think its an environmental factor for climate change but we all know that the biggest changes arent happening (a very tiny percentage accounts for the most pollutants but nothing is done about those) But following the money its clear that climate change is a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue This is extremely clear because two separate Senate and house committees met with banks in May about climate changewhy would they meet with banks instead of oil companies or manufacturers? Again the evidence points to a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue But theyre pushing us simply to change what system we consume while avoiding the largest climate change pollutants And even ending the oil system next is energy sourcingwell enter in Afghanistan popping up again and the Taliban/ISIS (which is where the largest lithium deposit is) But the key point is that we will move off of seaparate working grids (because even if you steal gasoline it still works on your vehicle) onto one grid that uses unique identification (which electrical vehicles already do but again is part of the movement away from the machine driven system and into the computer/tracking system) And what about the old infrastructure? Have you noticed how all those hacking attacks kept happening to old infrastructure key points? And the hackers keep asking other countries for huge amount of bitcoin? Have you noticed how war keeps popping up involving all those countries on the old system? Must be a complete coincidence Im sure But well know for sure this is the case if the market crashes soon Hyperinflation is close and technically happening but the FED refuses to acknowledge it (crazy how we dont vote for the FED president and yet they control the entire economy) Weve now had the largest 12 month increase in inflation since 1983 The CPI has changed over and over how inflation is measured true inflation is estimated anywhere from 13% - 25% (but you already know that and likely got your rent hiked already up 20% year-over-year) Thats what happened in the 30s right as they switched to a new backing for the dollar (with Gold) and were seeing all the signs present now that this is true If were about to end the machine driven age and start the computer driven stage then we would each need a unique wallet address and a passport can accompany that It would be the easiest way to install worldwide tracking (since crypto provides a ledger for everything) Also well know bitcoin prices will shoot through the roof after a crash if all this is true and happens Either way this ties corona (an excuse for mass printing of money) the vaccine (more money and a unique wallet tied to ID) end of petro dollar and machine age (climate change is a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue end of plastics from oil) end of the retail to stores system and move to full digital marketplace the beginning of the crypto dollar and crashing the crypto markets (already happened but still can drop much farther along with the rest of the market similar to exact same scenarios in the past) Were entering into the most tracked age of all time everything on the planet will be tracked back to unique ids and monitored on a blockchain/verified by a computer "The Great Reset" might sound like a conspiracy meme but thats an awful lot of coordination to happen in a short period of time Even better since I wrote this the IMF and 10 countries got together in Israel and [Simulated a Cyber Attack that would shut down the Global Financial System](https://financeyahoocom/news/exclusive-imf-10-countries-simulate-133015124html) Im sure thats just a coincidence too! Im sure once it happens everyone will be shocked and demand answersthat they already have Its coming my guess is at the start of Bidens second term since thats when they did it with Nixon Ill keep writing this and if Im wrong I will stop but weve been checking off each point from that paper by Blackrock ever since corona started Every company put money back into their company and was given a massive amount with the PPP loans and every country matched financial and monetary policies and was given massive amounts of money during corona Soif the market started showing signs of a massive failure in 2019 and this paper was put out in August 2019 and weve followed every item line by line of this outline since then and it came before coronathen what does that say about corona This was the single largest robbery in history and unless you are in the 1% then you are going to be the one paying for it You paid for it not just with two full years of your life hearing about this you didnt just pay by having communities torn apart or having to hear people argue about things that arent the actual problem you didnt just pay for it by having to actually stay in solitary confinement that includes the ability to watch your phone and the internetyou literally are going to actually pay for the rest of your life with the inflation costs and debt Well see if this is rightbut weve already checked off most the points from that paper The rich got so insanely rich since this happened It was literally the best year for Wall Street but how was it for most people?,garthsworld,16474938020,2

Who is or isnt invited "We have to invite so & so because of this frivolous empty reason" Combine the 2 & you have phoniness on top of phoniness Best example I can think of is Howard Stern He had Chevy Chase & Donald Trump at his 2007 wedding He had Trump on the show but they were never social And he had just "made up" with Chevy after a feud & immediately gives him an invite while snubbing long time show staff & friends With her connections its not crazy that she was there on a superficial level Again I do think they conspired But I dont think this is a big deal to point to,SiriusC,16230724380,35

gwe22ao,n13x8h,Law enforcement in itself is not about justice Theyre order-followers And order-followers do as theyre told with no thought of their own about whether its right or wrong - for a paycheck Once you understand who is *really* giving the orders the Epstein situation makes perfect sense Heres a clue: Notice the black & white chess-board symbolism police wear around their heads? The occult meaning for that: Not knowing the difference between right & wrong Police officers owners and they *do* have owners put that symbolism there intentionally as a form of mockery They put it directly around police officers brains Their owners laugh hysterically about this behind closed doors The problem is those who work in law enforcement have confused man-made law with actual justice (Natural Law) They dont see the difference - and there is an *enormous* difference They need an understanding of Natural Law and there is a lot of effort put forth to hide knowledge of Natural Law from the public Natural Law is logic-based and contains absolute truths about morality Man-made laws on the other hand involve people writing down that they have "authority" over others and then mind-controlling the public into believing that makes that authority real Of course it doesnt in reality But the reason things like Epsteins death are allowed to happen is because the people working in law enforcement simply do as theyre told by their higher-ups regardless of whether its actually right or wrong No real improvement will occur for humanity in terms of all these conspiracies until far more people begin understanding Natural Law and applying it to their actions instead of believing in the supposed "authority" of government Thats the root of the problem for *all* conspiracies - and the solution We are quickly running out of time to do this And the vast majority of people believe in the legitimacy of the authority of government right now That needs to change Were nowhere near where we need to be with not much time left Anyone reading this please help spread the word about Natural Law Look into it for yourself if you dont know about it,Law_of_1,16197586280,3

I really dont buy the idea that shed be afraid for her life I dont think she wants to spend years in prison and probably sees that as a fate worse than death,TallGrayAndSexy,16408743500,193

hqkr163,rs1onc,Its like nobody in /r/conspiracy follows any news but /r/conspiracy Epstein was having sex with these teenage girls Epstein (sometimes with Maxwells help) recruited them and paid them for sex ie rape That is trafficking Years ago before he killed himself Epstein was convicted on sex charges; again recruiting and paying girls to come to his Palm Springs mansion and massage him and provide sexual favors ie rape That is also trafficking Apparently Epstein also coerced some of these girls to have sex with his friends or acquaintances Prince Andrew and Alan Dershowitz That is also trafficking Epstein wasnt kidnapping children from third-world villages and selling them on the dark web Epstein did not run a "pedophile ring" You can imagine that everyone who ever met or was in a photo with Jeffrey Epstein was constantly gang-raping children (and apparently thats what this sub is for) but there is simply no evidence to suggest that Epstein was trafficking girls other than for *his own* enjoyment and perhaps eventually a couple of his acquaintances Thats it folks Calm your conspiracy boners,Natural-Born_Easman,16408886500,1

He was responsible for keeping the words largest child sex ring trafficker alive to testify! Whats even sketchier is that Trumps DOAs dad was best buds with Epstein and got Epstein important positions that he was professionally unqualified for Oh yeah the same father also wrote a book about a billionaire pedophile sex ring alien slave cult To summarize: William Barr was the Trump Attorney General at the time His father Donald Barr was long-term good friends with Epstein and even got him high paying jobs that he wasnt qualified for Trump used to hang out with Epstein all the time in the 90s and 00s they even threw a private party with Trump Epstein and multiple of Epsteins prostitutes My opinion: Trump and Barr killed Epstein because Barr was protecting his father/himself and Trump obviously protecting his own skin,blarn_draper,16408985320,-1
hqkvtkf,rs1onc,Although a good number of people are being blackmailed theres another group of people who subscribe to an epicurean do what thou wilt philosophy and so see nothing wrong with having a little "fun" Even if the kids is hurt or traumatized "who cares"? It doesnt really matter in the end Nothing does And this philosophy of "nothing really matters in the end" - this is the ontological heart of western liberalism Its all a bunch of ad-hoc "guesstimating" which may be sophisticated in its planning but completely stupid at its philosophical foundation I remember watching a lecture a long long time ago when I was a different person On one side of the debate was the fiery Rabbi Meir Kahane notorious for his impassioned zionism and his own aspirations to become a leader in Israeli politics Kahane had a very charismatic personality as it was impossible not to like him; also he seemed to understand the decadence at the core of western civilization philosophy and culture which spoke to me On the other hand Kahane was militantly jingoistic in much of his rhetoric and often advocated policies that seemed a bit insane - like totally inviting the rancor of the surrounding world upon the Jewish state On the other side of the debate was a poinderextery Alan Dershowitz With his curly hair bushy mustache short posture and his trademark brazenness Dershowitz was arguing on the side of "liberalism" and its value to human life It was a good debate Interesting It was Kahanes charmisma versus Dershowitz yelling And despite being such a short and unattractive guy - there is something unusually energetic about Dershowitz If you listen to this man speak he really seems to believe exactly what he says It seems impossible to think that he is simply "lawyering" you yet this is what hes doing What kind of minds do people like alan dershowitz have? It seems strange and unusually Unnerving even Something odd Uncanny unfamiliar Could it be this man speaks with a forked tongue? How many politicians convey what seems like sincerity - and is indeed sincerity - yet is a false sincerity a weaponized sincerity a killing you with kindness type of orientation A person who experiences his embodiment as a tool to be used and not something to be identified with In short it is simply astonishing how utterly different a human life can feel On one end are the aggrandizers who *weaponize kindness love and compassion to suit their own aggrandizing ends* Its astonishingly disingenuous cold and cruel These people feel in short fundamentally invulnerable On the other end is the reverse situation; people so enfeebled and tortured by life that they will adopt any posture rule and quality - typically will abide by the structure of reality - in order to live unmolested by negative feelings To feel peace in other words - albeit such peace necessitating a tolerant attitude to experiences of discomfort and pain,SockMaximum,16408904710,0

hmgdleq,r45a5n,I remember when this was first discovered/posted on r/conspiracy back when she was arrested in 2020 and the account suddenly went dark It was fascinating to watch it come together in real time This information had better be a part of the prosecutions case in the trial Ill tell you why Im 99% sure personally that /u/maxwellhill was Lady Ghislaine herself I also am about 75% sure Aaron Swartz unearthed EVERYTHING related to Jeffrey&Ghislaine/Intelligence Agencies/human trafficking/political blackmail/Moloch when he hacked the MIT research lab which Jeffrey was a prominent associate of Aaron hacked the private servers there and found something he was NOT supposed to find and was soon charged with such extreme punishments by the court system which led to his suicide (I have no reason to think he was assassinated but of course it wouldnt surprise me Look up [the relationship between Courtney Love and her father/The Grateful Dead/CIA/MKUltra](https://covertactionmagazinecom/2021/07/21/u-s-intelligence-coverup-newly-declassified-fbi-file-on-nirvanas-kurt-cobain-compounds-evidence-implicating-his-wifes-role-in-his-murder/) Kurt was likely assassinated by these forces for being a political thorn in their side to a much lesser degree than Aaron was becoming Smart skilled young men who competently buck the system are their worst nightmare and must be *crucified*) Aaron died in 2013 and /u/maxwellhill IIRC showed up as a high level account around 2012 The SOPA/PIPA protests spearheaded by Aaron and others in his circle were around 2012 and their success put Aaron on the elites map in a bad way Then when he found whatever he found hacking MIT he became a HUGE problem for their scheme Poor kid probably had no idea what to do with himself 26 years old and to discover all this by yourself and to live with it alone? Think of the emotional trauma we have all endured in the last years as all this has come out and weve had each other to get through it all Aaron had no one He was probably absolutely fucked in the head/heart by the time he died You know maybe I dont know 100% if any of this is true But it sure does add up Also the McGraw-Hill textbook company (the makers of all our K-12 school history textbooks) is owned by the Maxwell family So /u/maxwellhill controls the narrative just as McGraw-Hill does Its a cute pun Ill give her that,umbertostrange,16381375500,124

i0egqpb,tcdedn,This is not truth this stance doesnt even make sense to me this is just a pussy way to say that you are afraid of Russia and you blame Ukraine and the US for "poking the bear" Its an attempt to show a neutral stance but shows a lack of recognition of events UN/NATO never threatened Russian sovereignty or the country at all Ukraine never threatened Russian sovereignty The US never threatened Russian sovereignty However Russia threatens Ukrainian sovereignty and the sovereignty of other nations like Georgia since 2008 and Moldova Putin is threatening nuclear war if we dont let him get what he wants Russia has waged proxy wars similar to the Ukrainian proxy war that started in 2014 that made the recognition of the DPR and LPR areas possible for a long time Ukraine voted 92% in favor of independence from Russia when the USSR fell NATO is a defensive alliance and independent countries should be able to choose their security agreements Especially considering these smaller countries (that are smaller than Ukraine) are obviously at risk from Russian interest Ukraine used to be Russia but by that logic alot of our countries would not be considered legitimate The US did back a coup in Ukraine in 2014 against a man Putin put in charge the same way he rigs his own elections all these years The Ukrainian people fought for the change in government so they could have their own and I find it funny how many Americans want to criticize wanting to change their government with help from another country As if American independence wasnt funded by France The only threat NATO poses to Russia is to Russian oligarch interest in invading countries or waging proxy wars to gain territory for "security" or resources So the reason why its offensive is bc its stupid,BigDisco6,16471117520,1
i0ct57w,tcdedn,yup this isnt our fight but we are being made to fight it with our wallets with our dollars with our purchasing power and with our general overall national sentiment anyone that isnt from that part of the world or doesnt have family in that part of the world have no say in the matter not even those fiscally involved because you can uninvolve yourself very easily you cant just stop being ukranian or russian theres going to be a massive wave of asylum seekers from both countries shortly its only going to get uglier for europe as time goes on and itd get worse if we got more involved i sympathize for everyone involved but frankly i do not care about russia i do not care about ukraine i barely care enough about my own survival yet im being asked to care about one side or another fuck everyone and everything that tells you how to feel thats on the internet man,phragmatic,16470814020,-6
i0dd1oh,tcdedn,So I dont understand what the Ukrainian government did in this case other than defend themselves I agree with the sentiment of concern for the people of both nations but if we compare the Ukrainian actions with the Russian actions we dont have an apples to apples thing If a bully starts beating someone up in school and that someone fights back yes both get in trouble for fighting I think that is bullshit too Lets not get so woke with our "for the people" circle jerk that we forget that there are governments on a whole different scale of asshole from other governments,smedley89,16470950050,0
i0dfu6d,tcdedn,I understand your sentiment so much suffering on both sides But Ukraine was invaded that is the difference Sadly the Russian people will suffer also because their leader is and insane narcissist But at least the Russians can sleep in their own beds and give birth in a hospital or drive down the street without worrying about being bombed The Russian people will suffer economically for years to come becuase of the action of their government but most will survive as will their countrys infrastructure The Russian people dont have to run in fear from their homes leaving everything sometimes even pets behind as they seek some sort of safety The Russian people dont have to flee on foot to other countries hoping someone will take pity on them and provide warmth food and shelter as they leave their sons and husbands behind Imagine those pregnant women in the hospital or the tiny babies in the NICU being rushed through rubble to a basement where nurses desperately try to keep them safe and alive with bombs dropping around them That is real terror Ukraine is being invaded and leveled only because one man wants the land But you are right in that both Ukrainian and Russian people are suffering but it is not equal levels of suffering Its ok to feel empathy and sadness for both no one is making you "love" one side and "hate" the other You can stand with Ukraine AND hate what Putin is doing to his own people I personally feel such pain for the Russians who have no idea whats going on and are losing access to money food even stuff that gets them through the day like McDonalds and video games Its not fair to the citizens Sanctions like that are meant to squeeze the citizens who would then put pressure on the government which in this case does not care one bit what happens to the millions of people they are tasked with looking after Its horrible and unfair to the Russians but Ukraine is not the one doing these things to the Russians Ukraine is simply trying to survive right now I think we can all agree that Putin and his corrupt government are the bad guy here yes? TL:DR: Its ok to feel sad for the citizens of both countries but there is clearly one Country who is the aggressor and one being mercilessly attacked But the average Russian citizen is not to blame and its ok to have empathy for them as well,thisistherightname,16470964080,1

It doesnt stop bullets It doesnt bring loved ones back and if I am being honest it doesnt put gas in anyones tankwellnot your average civilians anyway None of this gets remedied until those who are responsible are held accountable The problem with this is that 9 out of 10 times (if not more) we are dealing with "strawmen and figureheads" Those who create and control these catalysts arent celebrity politicians posing on mainstream media And this is why people get annoyed by this fluff It isnt bringing awareness It isnt exposing anything Its just "I have feelings" Great you have feelings Now what?,I_Am_Contrivance,16471066640,1

h6bceli,oq0kxg,For those that complain of capitalism or communism or what not the real issue is the kid raising system Lets pretend you want to be a millionaire by 30 In a college system with $100k of debt starting at 22 you basically need to earn around $150k per year after taxes and expenses to get to $1 Mil by 30 if investments go well etc (about doubling) Now remove college all together Instead of $150k you need like $90k Now imagine you take a kid and instead of the asinine question what do you want to do (all girls : animals community kids environment all boys : outdoor guy what my dad did) - and instead say what do you want to have This is what I do They always want a nice car vs shit car They want a happy spouse with kids vs alone and desperate They want to be able to afford medicines vs bothering family with a go fund me Its a relatively easy decision; lots of money better There are actually a LOT of careers that pay $90k without a degree Now if you plan for this you get them as an apprentice BUT ONLY for careers that pay $60k base and $200k tops like computers legal finance media & medical I had a dancing girlfriend that became a doctor simply by working at Walgreens She of course had no concept of what being a doctor was but after the pharmacist kept giving her money driving a nice car and invited her to her nice house - boom she became a doctor (internally) It was easy But more to the point I got this trailer kid that I sponsored over a few years who will be making $60k at 18 in computers - all I had to do was pay him $100 or so at a time for computer work here and there roughly what I would have paid someone else He *might* be a millionaire by 30 working full time in computers at 18 with what is normally referred to as the best resume theyve seen - and thats even when he slacked off (his dad gets him drunk weekly and his aunt keeps telling him to spend the next several years getting high and going to music shows thats what life is about!) - I did help him start his own business but he never did the professional networking meetings I suggested And the Key to all this? Benjamin Franklins Autobiography!!! Seriously!!! In it is a quick self study guide (13 virtues) to teach you to not be a dick Then there is the Junto system to make you network and listen to others and learn from them share with them in a constructive way And the final piece of the Benjamin Franklin system was to teach kids (nephews in his day) your skills when they were about 15 Then invest in them enough to start a shop (like $20K say) Then they pay you 50% of profits the next several years In Franklins system he went from poor as fuck to worker (18) - $30k (in todays money) - to extremely good worker living healthy connected and disciplined - shop manager (21) $60k - But the kicker at 32 he invested in 3 nephews basically This is where he made all his money Those nephews were also printers like him By 37 he was retired - and most of his inventions & political involvement happened after 37 (1740) And it was Franklin *the most* responsible for the AM Revolution cause he taught people how to make a fuck ton of money basically (and not to be assholes - EI self governing) Meh dribble but if you do something similar to what the Swiss do today where the average professional salary *is actually* $200000 then ALL of economics solves itself But they force kids into smart apprenticeship programs at 15 Thats the biggest difference The good kids are in professional clubs by 17 This is 100% normal Making $60k out of a Swiss high school is absolutely the norm and the reason the main reason they have such immense wealth Literally every nation could copy this approach and not take away from anyone else but we dont for whatever reason but you should do so with your kids always,Bitcoin1776,16270878610,1

h6azoh2,oq0kxg,No one takes out 200k at 17 most of the people taking out that much in student loans are in medical/pharmacy/veterinary school possibly Graduate programs And are therefore not 17 more like 22-23 at that point after bachelors Most of these people are making 100-200k a year after residency and can easily pay off their loan if they were disciplined and/or financially literate and is a great RoR on the money borrowed and will not have difficulty finding employment The people loaning know this A business loan is a lot more risky most small businesses go out of business is the sad reality Undergraduate loans are another beast but at the same time there is an element of personal responsibility to consider here You have the ability to choose where you go you dont have to pay 40k a year to go to a private college when you can go to a college that is just as good for 10k You can go to community college for the first 2 years and save tons of money You can live off campus and work to pay rent and food and gas you dont have to get a housing loan At the end of the day you have a lot of control over how much you choose to borrow you also have control over what major you study and understanding the job market and what businesses are looking for those skills how you can market in the job place So when people complain about their huge undergrad loans and cant find a job well Im not saying the system isnt broken but there is an element of personal responsibility objectivity and neutrality that I feel needs to be embedded into this discussion,MissionIll0,16270811450,-1

hhi7pzn,qcsqbl,reminds me of the time previous to the 2016 election when we saw a similar flavor of astroturfing There was a huge frontpage post titled something like "Former Trump supporters of reddit what was the final straw for you?" Meanwhile a low key protest was brewing behind the scenes where thousands literally thousands of users made identical posts "Former Hillary supporters of reddit what was the final straw for you?" The posts were absolutely flooding the new queue for like 12 hours but of course they were all rapidly being deleted as soon as they came in Anyone else remember this? I actually made this post myself completely unaware at the time it was happening because I thought the Trump post was such propagandistic bullshit that I felt compelled to act But after seeing people immediately crying fanatically for me to stop in my post replies and realizing what was going on I of course proceeded to flood the queue a few more times with a few dupe accounts This current account might even be one of those dupes Im too lazy to check Fun shit tho,Herpa_Derpa_Island,16348326620,4

If you mention Jesus or anything you shouldnt be a politician because you cannot make policies based in religion (like abortion) when most of the country isnt even religious anymore Its time for this to end Im cool with getting rid of both parties and starting over hell there are some really good things I think Republicans stand for I was a republican all throughout highschool and college But your party has lost its way and is letting a little handed man who likes to be peed on take over Its really sad and pathetic how much some Republicans worship him You do know once he dies the Republican party is pretty much done,forgotmyemail19,16348474830,-5

OPIUM WARS - The Original NARCO-COLONIALISM - The Original State Sponsored Drug TrafficStarting in in the mid-1700s the British began trading opium grown in India in exchange for silver from Chinese merchants Opium  an addictive drug that today is refined into heroin  was illegal in England but was used in Chinese traditional medicine 1 https://enwikipediaorg/wiki/Opium\_Wars https://enwikipediaorg/wiki/First\_Opium\_War https://enwikipediaorg/wiki/Second\_Opium\_War 2 This war with China really seems to me so wicked as to be a national sin of the greatest possible magnitude and it distresses me very deeply Cannot any thing be done by petition or otherwise to awaken mens minds to the dreadful guilt we are incurring? I really do not remember in any history of a war undertaken with such combined injustice and baseness Ordinary wars of conquest are to me far less wicked than to go to war in order to maintain smuggling and that smuggling consisting in the introduction of a demoralizing drug which the government of China wishes to keep out and which we for the lucre of gain want to introduce by force; and in this quarrel are going to burn and slay in the pride of our supposed superiority  Thomas Arnold to W W Hull March 18 1840 http://wwwvictorianweborg/history/empire/opiumwars/opiumwars1html 3 https://webarchiveorg/web/20180311121505/https://sacuorg/opium2html See also Opium in China In 1997 the colony of Hong Kong was returned to China Hong Kong Island became a British possession as a direct result of the Opium War the opening shots of which were fired 150 years ago All Chinese regardless of political ideology have condemned this armed confrontation as an unjust and immoral contest As far as they are concerned Britians waging a war for the sake of selling a poisonous drug constitutes the most shameful leaf of human history In the hindsight provided by subsequent events in China it is perhaps easy to condemn this act of British aggression but it is less certain that the event was seen in the same condemnatory light by Chinese and foreign observers a century and a half ago 4 Article on opium trade in 1920s Shanghai http://streetsofshanghaipbworkscom/w/page/18638691/Opium Opium (yapian ) Shanghai was built on the opium trade Before the 1850s Shanghai was the terminal port for coastal opium traffic Shanghai was opened to foreign trade on November 11th 1843 and very soon afterwards Jardines (the biggest British company in China at the time) set up a branch there and hired Chinese compradors one of whom was solely concerned with the supervision of opium By 1845 the opium moving through Shanghai constituted almost half of all the opium imported into China In 1880 nearly 13000000 pounds of opium came into China mainly from India By 1900 imports declined because China was now producing an average of 45000000 pounds of opium per annum itself There were at least 15000000 Chinese opium addicts  in Chengdu there was one opium den for every 67 inhabitants of the city In Shanghai some foreign missionaries began to complain that their homes were almost entirely surrounded by opium dens behind bamboo fences The city had more than eighty shops where the drug was sold openly in its crude form and there were over 1500 opium housesThe owners of these establishments bought their supplies from three major opium firms in the International Settlement  the Zhengxia Guoyu and Liwei All three were owned by Swatow (Chaozhou) merchants who formed a consortium This consortium obtained its opium from four foreign merchant houses: David Sassoon & Co ED Sassoon SJ David and Edward Ezra 5 Opium financed British rule in India http://newsbbccouk/2/hi/south\_asia/7460682stm What did you discover in the course of your research? How big was the trade? Opium steadily accounted for about 17-20% of Indian revenues If you think in those terms \[the fact that\] one single commodity accounted for such an enormous part of your economy is unbelievable extraordinary How and when did opium exports out of India to China begin? The idea of exporting opium to China started with Warren Hastings (the first governor general of British India) in 1780 The situation was eerily similar to \[what is happening\] today There was a huge balance of payments problem in relation to China China was exporting enormous amounts but wasnt interested in importing any European goods That was when Hastings came up with idea that the only way of balancing trade was to export opium to China,shylock92008,16270047200,2
h67hnxn,opbmcz,IS ANYONE APOLOGIZING TO GARY WEBB? by Michael Levine (DEA-RET) Gary Webb just in case youve already forgotten him was the journalist who in a well researched understated article entitled "The Dark Alliance" linked the CIA supported Contras to cocaine and weapons being sold to a California street gang and ended up literally being hounded out of journalism by every mainstream news peddling organization in the Yellow Pages Even his own employer The San Jose Mercury piled on for the kill And guess what? The CIA finally admitted yesterday in the New York Times no less that they in fact did "work with" the Nicaraguan Contras while they had information that they were involved in cocaine trafficking to the United States An action known to us court qualified experts and federal agents as Conspiracy to Import and Distribute Cocainea federal felony punishable by up to life in prison To illustrate how us regular walking around non CIA types are treated when we violate this law while I was serving as a DEA supervisor in New York City I put two New York City police officers in a federal prison for Conspiracy to distribute Cocaine when they looked the other way at their friends drug dealing We could not prove they earned a nickel nor that they helped their friend in any way they merely did not do their duty by reporting him They were sentenced to 10 and 12 years respectively and one of them I was recently told had committed suicide I have spent three decades as a court qualified expert and federal agent and am not aware of any class of American Citizen having special permission to violate the law that we have been taxed over $1 trillion in the past two decades to enforce; the law that every politician bureaucrat and media pundit keeps telling us protects us against the most serious danger to American security in our historyThe interesting thing to me about the Webb article is that the CIA is provably (and now admittedly) responsible for much larger scale drug trafficking than Webb alleged or even imagined in his report In fact according to a confidential DEA report entitled "Operation Hun a Chronology" that I used as part of the proof to back up the undercover experiences detailed in my book The Big White Lie (optioned for a movie by Robert Greenwald Productions) the CIA was actively blocking DEA from indicting many members of the ruling government of Bolivia from 1980-83during a time period that these same people were responsible for producing more than 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States As CIA Inspector General Hitz himself stated before congress it was during this time period that Nicaraguan Contra supporters were buying large amounts of cocaine from these same CIA protected Bolivians Do you think Congress wants to see this proof? The gang that cant spy straight as they are known to my listeners and about whom President Lyndon Johnson once said "When Rich folks dont trust their sons with the family money they send them on down to the CIA" certainly did a lot more damage to this nation than for example computer company owner Will Foster who was sentenced to 93 years in prison for possession of 70 marijuana plants for medicinal use Of course true to their shifty sleazy form while admitting that they did aid and abet Contra drug trafficking they are now refusing to release their own final investigative report which details the damning proof The same report that CIA Inspector General Fredrick Hitz during February 1998 had promised congress and the American people was forthcoming "shortly" because as CIA Director George Tenet now claims CIA does not have enough money in its budget to properly classify it You believe that then I know an old guy with a beard named Fidel wandering the streets of South Miami with an Island about 90 miles off the coast for sale He says the money is for his retirement How you ask do they get away with it? Well for one thing mainstream media the so-called Fourth Estate does all it can to help During the Iran-contra hearings when Senators Kerry and Damato were making pronouncements before the Senate indicating that the CIA was involved with drug trafficking Katherine Graham the owner of The Washington Post addressed a class of CIA recruits at CIAs Langley headquarters in November 1988 by saying: "There are some things the general public does not need to know and shouldnt I believe democracy flourishes when the government can take legitimate steps to keep its secrets and when the press can decide whether to print what it knows" Apparently CIA protection of drug trafficking was among those secrets Thus it should have been no surprise to those CIA agent recruits when Washington Post reporter and drug expert Michael Itsikoff wrote that there was "no credible evidence" linking the CIA supported contras to cocaine trafficking at the same time very credible evidence was being heard by Senator Kerrys committee indicating that the Contras may have been the top purveyors of drugs to Americans in our historyNeither should it have been a surprise to anyone who heard her statement when mainstream media refused to print the news that Oliver North US Ambassador to Costa Rica Lewis Tambs and various top level CIA officers were banned from ever entering Costa Rica by Nobel Prize winning President Oscar Arias for drug running The drugs by the way all going to us Nor should it have been a surprise when Gary Webb was destroyed by mainstream media for doing nothing more or less than telling the truth as he found it And now while CIA admits their felonies to the press but refuses to release the proof and Janet Reno the head of the Obstruction of Justice Department has done the unprecedented by classifying her own departments investigation into CIA drug trafficking the partnership for a Drug Free America is spending $2 billion of our tax money on already-proven-fruitless anti-drug ads And where do you think the money goes?

I mean we dont have to tell on them do we? Attorney General: Of course not! Well you did But I just changed the law Dont worry about it CIA Chief: Gee thanks!

According to Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif) who is calling for full disclosure of the facts "The CIA knew that the Contras were dealing drugs They made this deal with the Attorney General to protect themselves from having to report it" Some of the remaining questions may still be answered The Department of Justice and the CIA have finished separate investigations into possible CIA involvement in drug smuggling But neither report has been made available to the public; the Justice department cites an "ongoing investigation" while the CIA says their report is an internal document and therefore classified Says Congresswoman Waters: "What is it they dont want Americans to see?

h674p5o,opbmcz,1998: CIA Says It Used Nicaraguan Rebels Accused of Drug Tie; By James Risen July 17 1998 ; "The agencys decision to keep those paid agents or to continue dealing with them in some less formal relationship was made by top officials at headquarters in Langley Va" - NYT  https://wwwnytimescom/1998/07/17/world/cia-says-it-used-nicaraguan-rebels-accused-of-drug-tiehtml CIA Says It Used Nicaraguan Rebels Accused of Drug Tie By James Risen July 17 1998 The Central Intelligence Agency continued to work with about two dozen Nicaraguan rebels and their supporters during the 1980s despite allegations that they were trafficking in drugs according to a classified study by the CIA The new study has found that the agencys decision to keep those paid agents or to continue dealing with them in some less formal relationship was made by top officials at headquarters in Langley Va in the midst of the war waged by the CIA-backed contras against Nicaraguas leftist Sandinista Government The new report by the CIAs inspector general criticizes agency officials actions at the time for the inconsistent and sometimes sloppy manner in which they investigated -- or chose not to investigate -- the allegations which were never substantiated by the agency The inspector generals report which has not yet been publicly released also concludes that there is no evidence that any CIA officials were involved in drug trafficking with contra figures The fundamental finding of the report is that there is no information that the CIA or CIA employees ever conspired with any contra organizations or individuals involved with the contras for purposes of drug trafficking a United States intelligence official said The new report is the long-delayed second volume of the CIAs internal investigation into possible connections between the contras and Central American drug traffickers The investigation was originally prompted by a 1996 series in The San Jose Mercury-News which asserted that a dark alliance between the CIA the contras and drug traffickers had helped finance the contra war with profits from drug smuggling The second volume dismisses those specific charges as did the first volume released in January The series charged that the alliance created a drug trafficking network that introduced crack cocaine into South Central Los Angeles It prompted an enormous outcry especially among blacks many of whom said they saw it as confirmation of a Government-backed conspiracy to keep blacks dependent and impoverished The Mercury-News subsequently admitted that the series was flawed and reassigned the reporter In the declassified version of the CIAs first volume the agency said the Mercury-News charges were baseless and mentioned drug dealers who had nothing to do with the CIA But John M Deutch the Director of Central Intelligence at the time had also asked the inspector general to conduct a broader inquiry to answer unresolved questions about the contra program and drug trafficking that had not been raised by The Mercury-News Frederick Hitz then the CIAs inspector general decided to issue a second larger report to deal with those broader issues Many allegations in the second volume track closely with charges that first surfaced in a 1987 Senate investigation The CIA is reluctant to release the complete 500-page second volume because it deals directly with contras the agency did work with According to the report CIA officials involved in the contra program were so focused on the fight against the Sandinistas that they gave relatively low priority to collecting information about the possible drug involvement of contra rebels The report concluded that CIA officers did report on drug trafficking by the contras but that there were no clear guidelines given to field officers about how intensively they should investigate or act upon the allegations In all the CIA received allegations of drug involvement against about 50 contras or supporters during the war against the Sandinistas the report said Some of the allegations may have been specious the result of Sandinista propaganda American intelligence officials said It could not be determined from the CIAs records how many of the 50 cases were fully investigated But the agency continued to work with about two dozen of the 50 contras according to American intelligence officials familiar with the report They said the report had found that the agency was unable to either prove or disprove the charges or did not investigate them adequately American intelligence officials who provided information about the report declined to identify the individual contras who were the subjects of the drug allegations But they did say that in addition to individual cases the report found that drug allegations had been made against one contra organization a group known as 15th of September That group was formed in 1980 and was disbanded in January 1982 The CIAs decision to classify this second volume has already been met with criticism in Congress Senator John Kerry Democrat of Massachusetts who led a 1987 Congressional inquiry into allegations of contra drug connections wrote a letter Thursday to the Director of Central Intelligence George J Tenet asking that the report be immediately declassified Mr Kerry who has reviewed the second volume of the inspector generals report said he believed that CIA officials involved in the contra program did not make a serious effort to fully investigate the allegations of drug involvement by the contras Some of us in Congress at the time in 1985 1986 were calling for a serious investigation of the charges and CIA officials did not join in that effort Mr Kerry said There was a significant amount of stonewalling Im afraid that what I read in the report documents the degree to which there was a lack of interest in making sure the laws were being upheld A version of this article appears in print on July 17 1998 Section A Page 2 of the National edition

I t is now clear that this agreement began with the events described in THE BIG WHITE LIE; that the top drug traffickers in Bolivia then supplying virtually all the worlds cocaine-including Sonia Atala-were CIA assets that had to be protected from our deep cover probe Laura and I still have the proof of this that we used to back up the publication THE BIG WHITE LIE The same proof was later incorporated into other data backing up the publications of DEEP COVER and TRIANGLE OF DEATH [https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/](https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/) Our evidence-which congress has been craning its neck not to see- for instance shows clearly that during Operation Hun (the story in The Big White Lie) secret meetings were held with CIA and Justice Department wherein all indictments of top government officials in Bolivia were blocked We now believe this agreement began because of Operation Hun CIA had to hide the fact that they were supporting the people manufacturing virtually all the cocaine being produced in the world at that time In Deep Cover we showed that during Operation Trifecta-a highly successful deep cover probe into the top of the drug world in three countries (Panama Bolivia and Mexico) -Attorney General of the US Ed Meese found it necessary to warn the Attorney General of Mexico about DEAs case We (undercover DEA agents and Customs agents) found links between top US government officials and the people who murdered DEA agent Kiki Camarena that to this day go unexamined by our congress or anyone else In "TRIANGLE OF DEATH a work of "faction" we showed CIAs real-life involvement in the protection and creation of one of the most murderous criminal organizations to ever plague America an organization created by escaped Nazi fugitives under CIA protection-events occurring long before this alleged CIA Justice agreement And so the dance continues If anyone watched the CNN show you cannot have helped but notice the snickering on the part of Congressional chairman Porter Goss (an ex CIA officer) as congresswoman Maxine Waters spoke Now heres the reason why: Sources of mine who speak to me from inside this veil of secrecy out of conscience and because I am cheaper and more reliable than a psychiatrist have already told me the following: There is secret communication between CIA and members of the Congressional staff-one must keep in mind that Porter Goss the chairman is an ex CIA official- indicating that the whole hearing is just a smoke and mirror show so that the American people-particularly the Black community- can "blow off some steam" without doing any damage to CIA The CIA has been assured that nothing real will be done other than some embarrassing questions being asked That the hearings will result in the CIA receiving even a larger budget than the current $26 billion that they admit to One of the most distressing things for me a 25 year veteran of this business to listen to was when Congresswoman Waters said that the hearings were not about CIA officers being indicted and going to jail "That is not going to happen" she said Almost in the same breath she spoke of a recent case in Miami wherein a Venezuelan National Guard general was caught by Customs agents smuggling more than a ton of cocaine into the US Despite named CIA officers being involved in the plot as Congresswoman Waters stated the Justice Department will not tell her anything about the case because of "secrecy laws" No wonder chairman Goss was snickering She could not have played more neatly into CIA hands than to surrender before the battle was engaged For the entire existence of CIA they have gotten away with doing more damage to the American people than all our traditional enemies combined precisely because no one was ever prosecuted From the CIA protection of Nazi criminals from war crimes prosecution as they set up criminal organizations that preyed on America (Triangle of Death) to their lies to President Kennedy that dragged us into Bay of Pigs to their lies to President Johnson that dragged us into the Vietnam War to their creation of a pan Arab army of American hating drug trafficking terrorists during the Afghan War to the Church Commission hearings to MK-Ultra to the Bolivian Cocaine Coup ("The Big White Lie") to their protection of the worlds top cocaine traffickers as they laid waste to American streets (Deep cover) the CIA has acted exactly as Senator Frank Church once described them: "a runaway rogue elephantcompletely unresponsive to Congressthey (the CIA) have not only been unproductive they have been contra productive they have brought great shame on America" And the dance continues &#x200B; &#x200B; https://npredditcom/r/NarcoFootage/comments/nthcsy/dea6\_by\_dea\_hector\_berrellez\_wayne\_schmidt\_opr/ The KIKI Camarena murder was tied to the use of US intelligence using drug cartel ranches for Contra military training AND Contra/DOD/NSC/Oliver North drug smuggling ring at the same time MEREX Corp supplied arms and other items to the cartel/ It was owned by a Ex Nazi CIA agent named Gerhard Mertins the company also employed Klaus Barbie,shylock92008,16270103370,1

hw32nkr,snj9i6,When people say the seatbelt analogy (I usually hear it used as analogy for masks) I reverse it on them  yeah its exactly like a seatbelt A seatbelt made of soggy tissue paper you must now keep strapped on at all times Even when youre not in a vehicle even when youre nowhere near another human And you wear it strapped over your face forever That seems to end the argument lol,__MEOWFACE__,16443305670,-1
hw35c1p,snj9i6,Heres a better analogy: Look at the vaccination as street heroine It makes your pain go away temporarily causes terrible health impacts if you do it a lot and probably wont kill you the first time you take it That means that we should force unwilling people to take the drugs because it makes us feel smarter for willingly taking the drugs!,Mankowitz-,16443317260,1
hw32v4b,snj9i6,Wearing a seatbelt is the law Its in place bc wearing a seatbelt can save lives There are lots of laws in place to protect peoples health Seatbelts no smoking inside no drunk driving you need a license to operate heavy machinery cars need to be inspected before they can drive on the road OSHA rules and regulations expiration dates on food and on and on Do all these laws keep people safe 100% of the time- nope Do these laws save millions of lives every year- yes Please look up the information on vaccine side effects throughout history Its negligible compared to their effectiveness for saving lives What exactly are yall gonna say down the road when all vaccinated are fine and we havent been implanted with a disease or 5g chip?

hw497h0,snj9i6,You seem misinformed on the vaccine in general The reason comparing a seatbelt to the vaccine is an analogy is because its similar in some ways but the two are not exactly same And you must remember the context the seatbelt analogy is often brought up as an answer to "why do I need to wear a mask if I already have a vaccine" the answer of course being that we wear seatbelts as well as airbags because we want to improve our chances of not only not passing it on but also not dying You also seem to think that the risk of blood clots in the vaccine are bad would it surprise you to know that the coronavirus as a much much (x10) higher chance of blood clots "necrological disorders" and all manor of other side effects? You also seem to think theyre are some secret "long term results" were still waiting for but this is a strange thought No vaccine before has ever been present in the body for more than 6 months at the absolute most Vaccines as you know are there to train the immune system and dont stay in the body long usually around a month or less With 2 billion+ doses administered we still have no addition side effects so it seems strange to wait for these Covid on the other hand seems very capable of permanently damaging a lot of lung ear nose and throat systems with long term effects like difficult breathing lung capacity smell and taste and many more just being permanently changed Im not sure what "hiding the safety data" the cdc and all the drug agencies have been very forthcoming on all their trials You all even got mad at the cdc for saying there was no evidence of airborne contagion early on and then changing that stance after they researched it and got evidence Same thing with when they said dont wear masks at first as they were no thought at the time to be necessary but new data came out and the cdc adapted its message to the studies The cdc has been reflective of the data from the begining You might be talking about the preprint studies and the VAERS database stuff Those Im sure you have heard are flawed for many reasons their results may be correct or not but we need more data before we can say anything If the researchers and doctors at the head of the preprints or VAERS claims believed that they would want to wait for these studies But we did this cycle with monocoidal antibodies ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine and each time they put in the work for a big double blind study these drugs are reveal to do nothing or so little as to be nothing You also seem very concerned about the companies themselves but for all your conspiracy you dont look at the positives These companies are looking to make big money from government contracts and to get the biggest ones you need an effective vaccine as verified by the FDA and the 40 other countries the vaccine will go too including France Britain Germany and even our enemies China and Russia It in their best interest to make a working vaccine especially because they must compete in a hot market theyre now like 7 different vaccines from different companies so competition is fierce I mean just ask yourself if the vaccine was truly dangerous why wouldnt Russia or China talk about it Or the hundreds of journalists looking for hot stories or any of our allied countries to alter their friends or peoples or the competing companies after their government contract All these people and more would have to work together its impossible,rascalrhett1,16443466010,-4
hw378p6,snj9i6,This is completely missing the primary point of when most people are bringing up the seatbelt analogy Yes some people bring it up as a pure example of a mandated safety rule But the primary point of the seatbelt analogy is in explaining to people how a vaccine can be working but that the majority of people in some places who are hospitalized are vaccinated Thats because the ratios matter The analogy then is to how seatbelts work to reduce risk in crashes but far more people end up in hospitals from car crashes who were wearing seatbelts than who werent because almost everyone wears a seatbelt The only other context the seatbelts are sometimes used is analogous to masks and then the analogy works pretty well even in the use-case So this primarily seems to be an argument being directed at what is fundamentally a misunderstanding of the main reason seatbelts get mentioned,JoshuaZ1,16443325170,-7

hw75us4,snj9i6,I cant account for everytime somebody has used this as an analogy but the way I use it is as an error of inference Lets take a quote: "but you dont know if the vaccine is gonna save YOU" it would be like saying "but we dont know wether seatbelts actually work until it does" Yes we do because the statistics shows that hospitalization and deaths are much more likely to happen to unvaccinated Or simply using anecdotes "People I know got survived perfectly fine from covid" you would stop using seatbelts because somebody you know who survived without a seatbelt because statistically people actually survive using seatbelts all the time This is how I use it to point out errors in conclusions,EddyEdmund,16443924310,1

The old lady gave him an eerie look and responded: "Plague is my name and it is my turn visiting your city" "How many will you take with you this time?" asked the priest "Few only one thousand" the plague responded After a week( and meanwhile having informed for the situation in his city) the priest was returning and in the entrance of the city he encountered the plague that was leaving "You lied to me" he said " You told me that you will take with you one thousand and yet you killed five thousand" And she responded: " I didnt lie I only took one thousand The rest were killed by stress and fear",supernatural1789,16414219620,2

hrfghyd,rwkj3w,The worst is yet to come My religion (Orthodox) had prophecies about this and so far around 8-9 of them came true (theres more but they are some smaller ones so I wouldnt mention them) The one that is yet to come true is the one saying "once the humanity is at the point of not knowing what to do as times are getting worse and no solutions are to be found antichrist will appear with a solution" (I tried to translate it as best as I could) Vaccines are proving as failing which is exactly what they want The time will come when they will say publicly that they no longer know what to do and how to deal with the pandemic Thats when a *certain person* will appear with a "solution" to end all problems and he will be throned in UN as the humanitys saviour I made this as brief as I could as it is rather complex and in order to truly understand and believe all this youd need to know a lot of backstory Another huge one said that "there will be a global pandemic before the end" (This one was told about 200-300 years ago iirc) We live in the end times sadly You may or may not believe me but Ive been following advices that my religion told me due to these prophecies and I havent regretted a single decision I made thus far Ive simply been following prophecies and what they tell us to do and Im making it work Havent and wont take the vax as I know what it is leading towards,HRCK0,16414291920,2

hka0i22,qruujv,It looks like they have started running the CCP AI app on YouTube This morning it was sending me some propaganda that is supposed to start their #HelterSkelter agenda They just slip random propaganda in your timeline with lots of fake AI bot chatter trying to convince you in their #HegelianDialect agenda The data suggests they have finite targets for the brainwashing Their looking for people just not thorough or not detail-oriented enough and subject to peer-pressure # Many will fall victim to the #HERMETECISM,westsan,16366810400,-5
hkary8h,qruujv,I know its tough for people to boycott YouTube Its tough for me But what about if we boycott the companies that advertise on YouTube?

Im going to start doing it! Whos with me?,Chichipato69,16366944050,0
hi7jskt,qgmft6,I sincerely think that whatever "standard retirement age" is at the time should be the end of their political careers Id rather have term limits but nobody with a "forever job" is going to vote to make it limited But if we set a "retire by 68" rule in our political system we may actually give incentive to get stuff done!,LochNessMansterLives,16353090190,138

hi8wzts,qgmft6,Its scary but boomers are still the largest voting block even as they are handing over the largest living generation to millennials or xenials or something like that They dont vote yet Its not shocking that from the time boomers have been voting adults that most of our politicians have been boomers We will only see younger elected politicians as boomers are no longer able to vote or die Generation X will probably be mostly skipped over for any time as the reigning generation because they are sandwiched between two much larger generations,HeligKo,16353429580,3

hi96pvr,qgmft6,"By owning and/or operating a network of logistical nodes across Asia Europe and Africa China can control a significant portion of its inbound supply chain for essential commodities and outbound trade routes for its exports" Bartholomew said during the Oct 17 hearing "In the event of conflict China could use its control over these and other ports to hinder trade access to other countries" Bartholomew cited data revealing that at least two-thirds of the worlds top 50 container ports are owned by the Chinese or supported by Chinese investments up from roughly 20% a decade ago Those investments include terminals at major US container ports in Los Angeles and Seattle Officials at the Chinese state-owned COSCO among the worlds largest container shipping lines acknowledged in 2018 that the company had connected its shipping routes along its Maritime Silk Road with emerging regional markets in West Africa Northern Europe the Caribbean and the US "to form a more comprehensive and balanced globalized network layout" US ports reliance on Chinese manufacturers for container gantry cranes is part of the investment concern according to Rep Alan Lowenthal D-Calif whose district includes the Port of Long Beach Lowenthal pointed out during the hearing that because of that reliance US ports have pleaded with the Trump administration to exempt gantry cranes from Chinese tariffs,heymingming,16353470740,1
