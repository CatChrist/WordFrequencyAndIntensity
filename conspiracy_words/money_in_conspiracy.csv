These people prey on the poor just as they abuse them for work they also use them for their own devious purposes! This is as old as our history MEN have sought out the vulnerable and taken advantage of them and abused them for whatever purpose they wanted! As a survivor of this type of destructive behavior it has taken me a long time to realize that it wasnt my fault but it breaks you down piece by piece until you start self medicating and then you are deemed a delinquent though the judges and lawyers know what happens when a child is thrust into something like this they have no compassion for the children they add abuse on top of the abuse! We have tried to bury this stuff for too long and it is time for those who are elected to protect and serve have to be held accountable and forced to start doing their job! I could tell all of the heart wrenching stories but it will not help to change some of the peoples minds that are in charge! The only time that they come close to caring is when it happens to a child of status and even then they try to bury it! They have the money to pay off the officials in the right places and it just keeps happening! I spent most of my life with anger and self medication and it hasnt really been much help I hope that this is a start to holding them accountable maybe this one woman will open the door for all to see just how pervasive this really is but she is going to have to draw a roadmap to how these people do the things they do!

Wrong they or their family just were willing to kill or do what ever was necessary to gain the power Even though shit doesnt make since to these normies its to difficult to except how fucked we are I guess or maybe they relate to the evil people and would do the same things if they had the chance I could never blindly listen and obey I question everything around me in the pursuit of knowledge and enlightenment Constantly thinking about how I can improve and better myself with my main focus being to spread love and happiness unity Unfortunately normies are to busy hating each other taking every word said on their favorite MSM source like its the holy gospel It really saddens me how bad this has gotten Dont just believe anything someone is telling you everyone has their own agenda My agenda is to unite and for The People to see how loving each other can change our lives and that we can easily do so much better then the evil people in power Their is only on thing more powerful then hate and that is love The agenda of the evil people who have worked very hard doing what ever neccessary to gain power and money is to keep that power,dillmayne2sweet,16249647110,3

guqfr1c,ms2o0d,What gets me its a couple things about how the system is fucked 1- we tax payers give grant money to smaller pharmaceutical companies The big companies dont want to do research and make medicine for very specific diseases that are rare and only affect a smaller pool of the population they want big net many fish So these smaller companies know this so they know they only way they can compete Id by looking for what disease is getting ignored/not being addressed directly so that becomes their niche But they dont have the money so they get a grant from the government This boosts their budget they increase employment and research and voila theyve created a treatment Now here comes the bigger pharmaceutical companies they see the need medicine and buy out the smaller company They then in turn self the new product at an outrageous price Talk about a winning scenario All you got to do is wait for a smaller company to get grant money do all the work and just buy them So we as tax payers pay to have these medicines made just to then pay for them at a steeper price and we dont get the grant money back 2- There is so much money in lobbying from Pharmaceutical companies (#1 lobbying industry by far) that they were able to convince Congress to vote against themselves being able to negotiate Medicare pharmaceutical prices with those companies A major reason these companies love America is because every other first world country has a system in place to make sure prices dont get out of hand We are their cash cow 3- Along with the pharmaceutical industry the health insurance industry (another top lobbying industry) is also a giant racket that takes advantage of us all These companies have done an amazing job to label things like universal healthcare as "socialist" and yea it might be but they dont care about that they just want you to be afraid of it because it would lead to them losing money The other thing that gets me is people who say "I dont want to pay for your insurance" thing is you already do we already do When an uninsured person goes to the ER they have to be treated When they cant pay the hospital gets that money through the insured by up charging everything Healthcare shouldnt be a for profit business at least to a point Healthcare doesnt fit the traditional supply and demand economic model of capitalism because the demand is always going to be high People are willing to spend whatever it takes to be alive You cant put a price on your life and theres companies know this Need a new heart? Well there isnt a discount store for that heres your bill Need life saving insulin? Well pay our prices because we convinced the government its illegal to go to Canada for 1/10 the price Healthcare and medicine shouldnt be political We put the most into our broken system than any other country and we get the least out of it All we have to do is follow the money and see whos profiting because odds are theyre the ones who stand to lose the most by changing the system Its the same thing with all the sentiment against renewable energy Whos profiting now and whos going to lose out by going to renewable energy?

guqmsco,ms2o0d,Amen brother The poorest of the poor can afford this because the government pays for their healthcare The rich can afford it because theyre well rich The people that suffer are the working class If they either allowed universal healthcare or actual competition the price would drop down to what its actually worth The American system however combines the negative aspects of both socialism and capitalism The prices are controlled by the government via regulations to reduce competition increase prices and create artificial scarcity This whole emergency response to covid is a testament more to the inadequacy of our healthcare system than to the actual danger posed by the virus Hospitals actually limit supplies and space to save money and keep people from being treated Its easy to justify refusing to treat poor people if one "doesnt have the supplies to treat them",FailOsprey,16185898100,3

hnv1iju,rc13h3,My theory for a long time now is that Epstein and Maxwell were part of a CIA or other black group operation The goal wasnt the teens They were a means to an ends -- extortion For both money and control Video evidence of you with a minor - whether you knew she was or not - could _ruin_ you You have little choice but to play ball I also think it was part of a larger plot to manipulate the stock market That Epstein wasnt a guru he was just part of a network of operatives who abused the stock market to generate black funds That the more money he controlled the more such funds could be generated Hence the need for extortion,Gr1pp717,16390641810,3

guyyunc,mtavfr,Check out the [National Endowment for Democracy](https://wwwnedorg/) which is a [a CIA front/group ](https://wwwjacobinmagcom/2018/03/trump-national-endowment-democracy-foreign-policy): >Awary Congress only agreed to create the NED in 1983 on the condition that the CIA not be involved something then-CIA director William Casey promised but didnt follow through on: at the last minute he had language prohibiting the involvement of CIA personnel removed from the bill The NED also appears to have been Caseys idea in the first place; he wrote a White House official that he was in favor of a "National Endowment in support of free institutions throughout the world" >The NED was initially placed under the auspices of the National Security Council and one Walter Raymond Jr a CIA propaganda expert who according to the late Robert Parry for years acted as liaison between the program and Casey Raymond also drew charming doodles like this depicting himself as a literal puppeteer controlling many different strings >The organization was stacked with prominent neoconservatives like Lane Kirkland John Richardson and Allen Weinstein Carl Gershman a longtime professional anticommunist was its first and so far only president One of its current board members Elliott Abrams is a war criminal with a history of subverting democracy overseas >To prevent the odor of US imperialism from contaminating the NEDs work the Reagan administration made it a private organization that in turn funded several more private institutions including the NDI and IRI But the fact that it was routinely staffed with former US officials and got its funding from the US government has always made this a dubious conceit >Equally dubious was the idea that its task was simply to promote democracy Two of its "core grantees"  which receive around 70 percent of its funding  are explicitly right wing: the IRI which is a GOP-led institution that once described its goals as advancing "democracy the rule of law and free-market economics"; and the Center for International Private Enterprise a project of the **US Chamber of Commerce** Even the Solidarity Center (formerly the Free Trade Union Institute) which is affiliated with the **AFL-CIO** went on to support conservative causes Only the NDI the Democrats arm could be said to be anywhere left of center Overall the NEDs track record tilts decidedly to the right CIPE and The Solidarity Center are two of the four grantees of the [NED](https://wwwsolidaritycenterorg/national-endowment-for-democracy-ned-ndi-iri-cipe-and-solidarity-center-welcome-increased-funding-from-congress/) NED does what the CIA used to do behind closed doors I thought the NED was pretty interesting considering Time Magazines story about the secret shadow campaign to save the [2020 election](https://timecom/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/) The article mentions multiple times how the group was working to protect and save Democracy (democracy is used ~33 times in the article) The article also outlines an alliance that included the AFL-CIO and the US Chamber of Commerce: >The pact was formalized in a terse little-noticed joint statement of the US Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO published on Election Day This article from [socialismcom](https://socialismcom/fs-article/betrayal-from-venezuela-to-iraq-the-afl-cio-and-the-national-endowment-for-democracy/) discusses how NED is a CIA front is funded by the US government and works closely with the leaders of the AFL-CIO: >A little-known far-right organization with a warm and fuzzy name the National Endowment for Democracy is up to no good in at least 40 countries That is bad enough especially given that the money for NEDs dirty deeds comes from working taxpayers courtesy of the US Congress Truly appalling however is the role that leaders of the AFL-CIO the largest US labor federation play in carrying out the work of this agency > A CIA front is born During the late 1970s the CIA was exposed for its active sabotage of numerous governments and progressive labor movements abroad Not so publicized was the AFL-CIOs role in aiding the CIA >Operating through the American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD) the AFL-CIO aided the overthrow of democratically elected governments in Guyana in 1963 Brazil in 1964 the Dominican Republic in 1965 and Chile in 1973 These are just a few examples of labor officialdoms shameful record in helping to carry out corporate-propelled US foreign policy >In 1983 after the CIA was widely discredited Ronald Reagans administration created a new agency the NED to take care of old business As an NED founder Allen Weinstein put it in 1991: "A lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA" >In his hard-hitting book Rogue State: A Guide to the Worlds Only Superpower William Blum describes some of the agencys activities "NED successfully manipulated elections in Nicaragua in 1990 and Mongolia in 1996 helped to overthrow democratically elected governments in Bulgaria in 1990 and Albania in 1991 and 1992 and was busy working in Haiti in the late 1990s on behalf of rightwing groups **NED like the CIA before it calls what it does supporting democracy** The governments and movements whom the NED targets call it destabilization" From the [Time 2020 election story:](https://timecom/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/) >"The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation" says Norm Eisen >The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation >The system didnt work magically Democracy is not self-executing" >And they believe the public needs to understand the systems fragility in order to ensure that democracy in America endures,Settlemente,16187557890,1

ha4m0dc,p0j98z,Well its abundantly clear that 9/11 was at least partly orchestrated by the US govt so I would not be remotely surprised if it were true There is no reasonable explanation for tower 7s instant collapse straight down into its own footprint aside from controlled demolition nor the other 2 towers but particularly tower 7 Dozens of high-rise buildings have been hit by planes and engulfed in flames you know how many have collapsed? The towers are the only ones There was a building engulfed in blazing hot fire for nearly 24 hours in the UK and it didnt collapse so how did a 57 story building fall from a "few office fires" in the top few floors? How do the 50 floors below just collapse in on themselves thru the path of greatest resistance thru 40000 tons of steel? The only way buildings fall straight down like that is if [every single column breaks within a fraction of a second of each other both support and core columns](https://wwwgooglecom/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://wwwnistgov/document/ae911truth-nist-written-submission12-18-07pdf&ved=2ahUKEwiw-KzA78jyAhVTHM0KHbpMDmUQFnoECBgQAQ&usg=AOvVaw02eXlOMUOMnDI8BFiE9YVB) Nevermind the plethora of residue found that was made up of all the components of thermite the cutting charge used to melt steel and demo buildings Or the molten steel that was running for literally 21 days **after** the attack or the 1340 temperature reading on the top of a pile of rubble with *much* hotter temps below literally not possible unless there were something like thermite used because "oxygen-starved hydrocarbon fires burn at no more than 600-800" And I find it *very* strange that just the day before the towers and the Pentagon were hit (the latter of which there was zero evidence of a plane) [Donald Rumsfeld had gone to Congress to tell them that he/Bushs admin had "lost" $23 TRILLION](https://wwwcity-journalorg/html/americas-missing-money-15725html) And where do you think evidence of the $23 trillion in missing transactions was stored?

h88guas,p0j98z,Mental illness is rising for 2 reasons 1) better identification and more diverse diagnostic criteria Back in the day your cousin was just "melancholic" rather than clinically depressed Thankfully weve moved to a more person centred therapy model for the most part that can identify increments of disorder 2) we love in a post capitalism hellscape where children are forced to run lemonade stands to pay for their insulin Non-clinical depression could be reduced dramatically if people were provided with more money less pressure and more time for self care But an exhausted and overstressed population has no energy to fight So were kept perpetually in crisis so were to scared to want change Covid probably threatened this balance more than any other event in recent history because our leaders *needed* to act or theyd be seen as incompetent and the only clear course of action gave many people a chance to relax recharge and see how much better the world could be Yes there was increased stress but after seeing how it could have been handled weve all started to realise how ripped off weve been for decades Thats why Ill never understand this idea that Covid is some tool of control its actually quite the opposite The more effective tool of control has been the squashing of critical thinking skills and the advanced propaganda techniques surrounding conspiracies Global elites can now hide anything in a conspiracy because theres a conspiracy about everything I think they learnt this around the 911 conspiracy time If left unchecked conspiracies get wilder and weirder until none of it seems plausible They just need whatever their doing to be on the bottom end of believable and well create the smoke screen for them by talking about lizard people and sacrificial children magic,Valor816,16284716440,1

i0zezv3,tg0kom,I posted this almost a year ago and have kept copying and pasting it because a lot of it has come true since then Ill warn you its long though This is a copy from another post but lines up the events of history that are being copied right now And why so many *Financial Issues* are being disguised (such as climate issues or pandemic issues) But a lot of this has happened before and is being full-on copied from other time periods and how even blackrock (the single largest hedge fund and called "The Fourth Branch of the US Government by Forbes and Bloomberg) [wrote the entire financial blueprint of what was going to happen before covid even started back in August 2019](https://wwwblackrockcom/corporate/literature/whitepaper/bii-macro-perspectives-august-2019pdf) Were seeing a complete system change why we needed to pump out a ton of money (literally 40% of all Dollars in existence were created in the last year) and why we need a WORLDWIDE unique Identification system tied to single individuals and a unique ID (a passport that is financial in its requirement but right now is being pushed through medical global requirements) Corona is a financial issue disguised as a pandemic issue because it can circumvent local laws and force the wordlwide laws Climate change is a financial issue being disguised as an ecosystem issue because again those laws are "bigger" than local laws and can circumvent normal procedures ----- We know "follow the money" to be the oldest and truest sense of deducing whats going on One of the things that stands out is that this event is following exactly the same events of the 20s and 70s Both times marked by huge inflation both times marked by a currency change and a new system and both times marked by a war that took place to get rid of the old system and expand the system while countries are hit hard by inflation But they all follow the same play ook = a massive amount of money was printed out and a certain assets price was then crashed that people were holding onto In the 20s-30s the asset was gold (whos price skyrocketed as money was printed and then crashed right before a market crash) and now with crypto currency (bitcoin was $7200 in january 2020 and got up to $60000 before crashing down to $32000 and flying back up to $65000 again and will probably crash even further once again before the final drop before it raises to crazy levels in ten years) In the case of gold the conspiracy is that two men formed a group and tried to corner the market and then the US released all its gold shares to crash that market and everyone sold their gold the US then used that price to buy gold from people and then backed the dollar with gold and even made owning it illegal alsoone of those two men who tried cornering the market was the Presidents brother in law so it was clearly a setup and a lot of people lost money but the US gained a lot of gold at cheaper prices right before switching the currency to be backed by gold So it was all about currency So why is the same thing happening again? August was the 50th year anniversary of Nixon ending the gold backed dollar in the 70s and starting the petro backed dollar So what does the end of the currency look like? Remember I said there was a crash for gold because the US released all its stores and crashed the market? Well guess [who owns the most bitcoin](https://wwwwiredcom/2013/12/fbi-wallet/)? Well for starters everyone will need a personal wallet (hence a vaccine passport for tracking is going to come sooner or later but this is the best excuse) The current chair of the SEC (Gary Gensler) who was installed in April taught a class about crypto currency at MIT Sloane (which is an enlightening resource if you want to see how officials view crypto currencies) He even talks about bitcoin finishing a 10 year testing phase and how it survived {what does that even mean? I thought Satoshi Nakamoto was an anonymous person I thought crypto was all about a decentralized financial platform and yet the current head of the SEC says it survived a testing phase?} So what else do we know signifies the end of the petro dollar? Weve all seen how much climate change pops up Well plastics are part of the oil system and thats part of the end too is my guess I know people think its an environmental factor for climate change but we all know that the biggest changes arent happening (a very tiny percentage accounts for the most pollutants but nothing is done about those) But following the money its clear that climate change is a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue This is extremely clear because two separate Senate and house committees met with banks in May about climate changewhy would they meet with banks instead of oil companies or manufacturers? Again the evidence points to a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue But theyre pushing us simply to change what system we consume while avoiding the largest climate change pollutants And even ending the oil system next is energy sourcingwell enter in Afghanistan popping up again and the Taliban/ISIS (which is where the largest lithium deposit is) But the key point is that we will move off of seaparate working grids (because even if you steal gasoline it still works on your vehicle) onto one grid that uses unique identification (which electrical vehicles already do but again is part of the movement away from the machine driven system and into the computer/tracking system) And what about the old infrastructure? Have you noticed how all those hacking attacks kept happening to old infrastructure key points? And the hackers keep asking other countries for huge amount of bitcoin? Have you noticed how war keeps popping up involving all those countries on the old system? Must be a complete coincidence Im sure But well know for sure this is the case if the market crashes soon Hyperinflation is close and technically happening but the FED refuses to acknowledge it (crazy how we dont vote for the FED president and yet they control the entire economy) Weve now had the largest 12 month increase in inflation since 1983 The CPI has changed over and over how inflation is measured true inflation is estimated anywhere from 13% - 25% (but you already know that and likely got your rent hiked already up 20% year-over-year) Thats what happened in the 30s right as they switched to a new backing for the dollar (with Gold) and were seeing all the signs present now that this is true If were about to end the machine driven age and start the computer driven stage then we would each need a unique wallet address and a passport can accompany that It would be the easiest way to install worldwide tracking (since crypto provides a ledger for everything) Also well know bitcoin prices will shoot through the roof after a crash if all this is true and happens Either way this ties corona (an excuse for mass printing of money) the vaccine (more money and a unique wallet tied to ID) end of petro dollar and machine age (climate change is a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue end of plastics from oil) end of the retail to stores system and move to full digital marketplace the beginning of the crypto dollar and crashing the crypto markets (already happened but still can drop much farther along with the rest of the market similar to exact same scenarios in the past) Were entering into the most tracked age of all time everything on the planet will be tracked back to unique ids and monitored on a blockchain/verified by a computer "The Great Reset" might sound like a conspiracy meme but thats an awful lot of coordination to happen in a short period of time Even better since I wrote this the IMF and 10 countries got together in Israel and [Simulated a Cyber Attack that would shut down the Global Financial System](https://financeyahoocom/news/exclusive-imf-10-countries-simulate-133015124html) Im sure thats just a coincidence too! Im sure once it happens everyone will be shocked and demand answersthat they already have Its coming my guess is at the start of Bidens second term since thats when they did it with Nixon Ill keep writing this and if Im wrong I will stop but weve been checking off each point from that paper by Blackrock ever since corona started Every company put money back into their company and was given a massive amount with the PPP loans and every country matched financial and monetary policies and was given massive amounts of money during corona Soif the market started showing signs of a massive failure in 2019 and this paper was put out in August 2019 and weve followed every item line by line of this outline since then and it came before coronathen what does that say about corona This was the single largest robbery in history and unless you are in the 1% then you are going to be the one paying for it You paid for it not just with two full years of your life hearing about this you didnt just pay by having communities torn apart or having to hear people argue about things that arent the actual problem you didnt just pay for it by having to actually stay in solitary confinement that includes the ability to watch your phone and the internetyou literally are going to actually pay for the rest of your life with the inflation costs and debt Well see if this is rightbut weve already checked off most the points from that paper The rich got so insanely rich since this happened It was literally the best year for Wall Street but how was it for most people?,garthsworld,16474938020,2

hmf22nu,r45a5n,Great work OP I can tell you care about this and damn it do I respect it I do have one small gripe though You suggest that she was working for Epstein Are we 100% sure she wasnt the one that was actually pulling the strings given her familys history and the intelligence connections/family business? I think thats a pretty decent probability in my opinion but Im just throwing it out there as food for thought Not a counter point per se but I think were doing ourselves a disservice if we dont consider some different possibilities with this situation And given the possible manufactured nature of Epsteins persona (nobody knows where he got his money seems to just show up in power circles is handled by law enforcement as an intelligence asset and is disappeared/murdered when captured to name a few) Ive caught myself wondering if Epstein himself was not a propped up ready to go expendable patsy I could even see a scenario where he may have thought he was setting up pedophiles like working for law enforcement Just to be clear Im NOT saying I believe that Im just saying there seems to be a lot more nuance to this situation than a lot of people want to acknowledge That is all I believe in casting a wide net and working from that Nothing more nothing less I think it helps That certainly would not make him a good guy (just to be clear again lol) but when you think of this case that way it opens up some interesting possibilities To believe that Epstein was the pinnacle here (in any way) is to take our eyes off the ball This guy was working for some entity My point in saying this is Epstein most definitely could be just a prop and always a cut out to take the fall that is a well known practice for these types I think there is just as much to indicate that Maxwell was the one in charge as there ever was that Epstein was the head of this Or it could go much deeper than that (very likely IMO) Thanks again for posting OP And take all of what Ive typed here with a spirit of being helpful because that is how it is meant,Flop_McKochen,16381184880,95

i0dfu6d,tcdedn,I understand your sentiment so much suffering on both sides But Ukraine was invaded that is the difference Sadly the Russian people will suffer also because their leader is and insane narcissist But at least the Russians can sleep in their own beds and give birth in a hospital or drive down the street without worrying about being bombed The Russian people will suffer economically for years to come becuase of the action of their government but most will survive as will their countrys infrastructure The Russian people dont have to run in fear from their homes leaving everything sometimes even pets behind as they seek some sort of safety The Russian people dont have to flee on foot to other countries hoping someone will take pity on them and provide warmth food and shelter as they leave their sons and husbands behind Imagine those pregnant women in the hospital or the tiny babies in the NICU being rushed through rubble to a basement where nurses desperately try to keep them safe and alive with bombs dropping around them That is real terror Ukraine is being invaded and leveled only because one man wants the land But you are right in that both Ukrainian and Russian people are suffering but it is not equal levels of suffering Its ok to feel empathy and sadness for both no one is making you "love" one side and "hate" the other You can stand with Ukraine AND hate what Putin is doing to his own people I personally feel such pain for the Russians who have no idea whats going on and are losing access to money food even stuff that gets them through the day like McDonalds and video games Its not fair to the citizens Sanctions like that are meant to squeeze the citizens who would then put pressure on the government which in this case does not care one bit what happens to the millions of people they are tasked with looking after Its horrible and unfair to the Russians but Ukraine is not the one doing these things to the Russians Ukraine is simply trying to survive right now I think we can all agree that Putin and his corrupt government are the bad guy here yes? TL:DR: Its ok to feel sad for the citizens of both countries but there is clearly one Country who is the aggressor and one being mercilessly attacked But the average Russian citizen is not to blame and its ok to have empathy for them as well,thisistherightname,16470964080,1

h6bceli,oq0kxg,For those that complain of capitalism or communism or what not the real issue is the kid raising system Lets pretend you want to be a millionaire by 30 In a college system with $100k of debt starting at 22 you basically need to earn around $150k per year after taxes and expenses to get to $1 Mil by 30 if investments go well etc (about doubling) Now remove college all together Instead of $150k you need like $90k Now imagine you take a kid and instead of the asinine question what do you want to do (all girls : animals community kids environment all boys : outdoor guy what my dad did) - and instead say what do you want to have This is what I do They always want a nice car vs shit car They want a happy spouse with kids vs alone and desperate They want to be able to afford medicines vs bothering family with a go fund me Its a relatively easy decision; lots of money better There are actually a LOT of careers that pay $90k without a degree Now if you plan for this you get them as an apprentice BUT ONLY for careers that pay $60k base and $200k tops like computers legal finance media & medical I had a dancing girlfriend that became a doctor simply by working at Walgreens She of course had no concept of what being a doctor was but after the pharmacist kept giving her money driving a nice car and invited her to her nice house - boom she became a doctor (internally) It was easy But more to the point I got this trailer kid that I sponsored over a few years who will be making $60k at 18 in computers - all I had to do was pay him $100 or so at a time for computer work here and there roughly what I would have paid someone else He *might* be a millionaire by 30 working full time in computers at 18 with what is normally referred to as the best resume theyve seen - and thats even when he slacked off (his dad gets him drunk weekly and his aunt keeps telling him to spend the next several years getting high and going to music shows thats what life is about!) - I did help him start his own business but he never did the professional networking meetings I suggested And the Key to all this? Benjamin Franklins Autobiography!!! Seriously!!! In it is a quick self study guide (13 virtues) to teach you to not be a dick Then there is the Junto system to make you network and listen to others and learn from them share with them in a constructive way And the final piece of the Benjamin Franklin system was to teach kids (nephews in his day) your skills when they were about 15 Then invest in them enough to start a shop (like $20K say) Then they pay you 50% of profits the next several years In Franklins system he went from poor as fuck to worker (18) - $30k (in todays money) - to extremely good worker living healthy connected and disciplined - shop manager (21) $60k - But the kicker at 32 he invested in 3 nephews basically This is where he made all his money Those nephews were also printers like him By 37 he was retired - and most of his inventions & political involvement happened after 37 (1740) And it was Franklin *the most* responsible for the AM Revolution cause he taught people how to make a fuck ton of money basically (and not to be assholes - EI self governing) Meh dribble but if you do something similar to what the Swiss do today where the average professional salary *is actually* $200000 then ALL of economics solves itself But they force kids into smart apprenticeship programs at 15 Thats the biggest difference The good kids are in professional clubs by 17 This is 100% normal Making $60k out of a Swiss high school is absolutely the norm and the reason the main reason they have such immense wealth Literally every nation could copy this approach and not take away from anyone else but we dont for whatever reason but you should do so with your kids always,Bitcoin1776,16270878610,1

h67hnxn,opbmcz,IS ANYONE APOLOGIZING TO GARY WEBB? by Michael Levine (DEA-RET) Gary Webb just in case youve already forgotten him was the journalist who in a well researched understated article entitled "The Dark Alliance" linked the CIA supported Contras to cocaine and weapons being sold to a California street gang and ended up literally being hounded out of journalism by every mainstream news peddling organization in the Yellow Pages Even his own employer The San Jose Mercury piled on for the kill And guess what? The CIA finally admitted yesterday in the New York Times no less that they in fact did "work with" the Nicaraguan Contras while they had information that they were involved in cocaine trafficking to the United States An action known to us court qualified experts and federal agents as Conspiracy to Import and Distribute Cocainea federal felony punishable by up to life in prison To illustrate how us regular walking around non CIA types are treated when we violate this law while I was serving as a DEA supervisor in New York City I put two New York City police officers in a federal prison for Conspiracy to distribute Cocaine when they looked the other way at their friends drug dealing We could not prove they earned a nickel nor that they helped their friend in any way they merely did not do their duty by reporting him They were sentenced to 10 and 12 years respectively and one of them I was recently told had committed suicide I have spent three decades as a court qualified expert and federal agent and am not aware of any class of American Citizen having special permission to violate the law that we have been taxed over $1 trillion in the past two decades to enforce; the law that every politician bureaucrat and media pundit keeps telling us protects us against the most serious danger to American security in our historyThe interesting thing to me about the Webb article is that the CIA is provably (and now admittedly) responsible for much larger scale drug trafficking than Webb alleged or even imagined in his report In fact according to a confidential DEA report entitled "Operation Hun a Chronology" that I used as part of the proof to back up the undercover experiences detailed in my book The Big White Lie (optioned for a movie by Robert Greenwald Productions) the CIA was actively blocking DEA from indicting many members of the ruling government of Bolivia from 1980-83during a time period that these same people were responsible for producing more than 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States As CIA Inspector General Hitz himself stated before congress it was during this time period that Nicaraguan Contra supporters were buying large amounts of cocaine from these same CIA protected Bolivians Do you think Congress wants to see this proof? The gang that cant spy straight as they are known to my listeners and about whom President Lyndon Johnson once said "When Rich folks dont trust their sons with the family money they send them on down to the CIA" certainly did a lot more damage to this nation than for example computer company owner Will Foster who was sentenced to 93 years in prison for possession of 70 marijuana plants for medicinal use Of course true to their shifty sleazy form while admitting that they did aid and abet Contra drug trafficking they are now refusing to release their own final investigative report which details the damning proof The same report that CIA Inspector General Fredrick Hitz during February 1998 had promised congress and the American people was forthcoming "shortly" because as CIA Director George Tenet now claims CIA does not have enough money in its budget to properly classify it You believe that then I know an old guy with a beard named Fidel wandering the streets of South Miami with an Island about 90 miles off the coast for sale He says the money is for his retirement How you ask do they get away with it? Well for one thing mainstream media the so-called Fourth Estate does all it can to help During the Iran-contra hearings when Senators Kerry and Damato were making pronouncements before the Senate indicating that the CIA was involved with drug trafficking Katherine Graham the owner of The Washington Post addressed a class of CIA recruits at CIAs Langley headquarters in November 1988 by saying: "There are some things the general public does not need to know and shouldnt I believe democracy flourishes when the government can take legitimate steps to keep its secrets and when the press can decide whether to print what it knows" Apparently CIA protection of drug trafficking was among those secrets Thus it should have been no surprise to those CIA agent recruits when Washington Post reporter and drug expert Michael Itsikoff wrote that there was "no credible evidence" linking the CIA supported contras to cocaine trafficking at the same time very credible evidence was being heard by Senator Kerrys committee indicating that the Contras may have been the top purveyors of drugs to Americans in our historyNeither should it have been a surprise to anyone who heard her statement when mainstream media refused to print the news that Oliver North US Ambassador to Costa Rica Lewis Tambs and various top level CIA officers were banned from ever entering Costa Rica by Nobel Prize winning President Oscar Arias for drug running The drugs by the way all going to us Nor should it have been a surprise when Gary Webb was destroyed by mainstream media for doing nothing more or less than telling the truth as he found it And now while CIA admits their felonies to the press but refuses to release the proof and Janet Reno the head of the Obstruction of Justice Department has done the unprecedented by classifying her own departments investigation into CIA drug trafficking the partnership for a Drug Free America is spending $2 billion of our tax money on already-proven-fruitless anti-drug ads And where do you think the money goes? Answer: to every major media corporation on the big board Gary Webb my friend you are owed a huge apology But I doubt that youll get it Not in this lifetime,shylock92008,16270105150,2

hw782az,snj9i6,@bonus-noise Youre gonna make me rip my hair out youre missing the most important point !!!! The big enchilada !!!

IT DUNKS ON THE VAX MANUFACTURERS SO HARD !!!,made-thisacct-tonite,16443940320,2
hw497h0,snj9i6,You seem misinformed on the vaccine in general The reason comparing a seatbelt to the vaccine is an analogy is because its similar in some ways but the two are not exactly same And you must remember the context the seatbelt analogy is often brought up as an answer to "why do I need to wear a mask if I already have a vaccine" the answer of course being that we wear seatbelts as well as airbags because we want to improve our chances of not only not passing it on but also not dying You also seem to think that the risk of blood clots in the vaccine are bad would it surprise you to know that the coronavirus as a much much (x10) higher chance of blood clots "necrological disorders" and all manor of other side effects? You also seem to think theyre are some secret "long term results" were still waiting for but this is a strange thought No vaccine before has ever been present in the body for more than 6 months at the absolute most Vaccines as you know are there to train the immune system and dont stay in the body long usually around a month or less With 2 billion+ doses administered we still have no addition side effects so it seems strange to wait for these Covid on the other hand seems very capable of permanently damaging a lot of lung ear nose and throat systems with long term effects like difficult breathing lung capacity smell and taste and many more just being permanently changed Im not sure what "hiding the safety data" the cdc and all the drug agencies have been very forthcoming on all their trials You all even got mad at the cdc for saying there was no evidence of airborne contagion early on and then changing that stance after they researched it and got evidence Same thing with when they said dont wear masks at first as they were no thought at the time to be necessary but new data came out and the cdc adapted its message to the studies The cdc has been reflective of the data from the begining You might be talking about the preprint studies and the VAERS database stuff Those Im sure you have heard are flawed for many reasons their results may be correct or not but we need more data before we can say anything If the researchers and doctors at the head of the preprints or VAERS claims believed that they would want to wait for these studies But we did this cycle with monocoidal antibodies ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine and each time they put in the work for a big double blind study these drugs are reveal to do nothing or so little as to be nothing You also seem very concerned about the companies themselves but for all your conspiracy you dont look at the positives These companies are looking to make big money from government contracts and to get the biggest ones you need an effective vaccine as verified by the FDA and the 40 other countries the vaccine will go too including France Britain Germany and even our enemies China and Russia It in their best interest to make a working vaccine especially because they must compete in a hot market theyre now like 7 different vaccines from different companies so competition is fierce I mean just ask yourself if the vaccine was truly dangerous why wouldnt Russia or China talk about it Or the hundreds of journalists looking for hot stories or any of our allied countries to alter their friends or peoples or the competing companies after their government contract All these people and more would have to work together its impossible,rascalrhett1,16443466010,-4
