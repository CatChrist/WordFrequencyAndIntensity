guqfr1c,ms2o0d,What gets me its a couple things about how the system is fucked 1- we tax payers give grant money to smaller pharmaceutical companies The big companies dont want to do research and make medicine for very specific diseases that are rare and only affect a smaller pool of the population they want big net many fish So these smaller companies know this so they know they only way they can compete Id by looking for what disease is getting ignored/not being addressed directly so that becomes their niche But they dont have the money so they get a grant from the government This boosts their budget they increase employment and research and voila theyve created a treatment Now here comes the bigger pharmaceutical companies they see the need medicine and buy out the smaller company They then in turn self the new product at an outrageous price Talk about a winning scenario All you got to do is wait for a smaller company to get grant money do all the work and just buy them So we as tax payers pay to have these medicines made just to then pay for them at a steeper price and we dont get the grant money back 2- There is so much money in lobbying from Pharmaceutical companies (#1 lobbying industry by far) that they were able to convince Congress to vote against themselves being able to negotiate Medicare pharmaceutical prices with those companies A major reason these companies love America is because every other first world country has a system in place to make sure prices dont get out of hand We are their cash cow 3- Along with the pharmaceutical industry the health insurance industry (another top lobbying industry) is also a giant racket that takes advantage of us all These companies have done an amazing job to label things like universal healthcare as "socialist" and yea it might be but they dont care about that they just want you to be afraid of it because it would lead to them losing money The other thing that gets me is people who say "I dont want to pay for your insurance" thing is you already do we already do When an uninsured person goes to the ER they have to be treated When they cant pay the hospital gets that money through the insured by up charging everything Healthcare shouldnt be a for profit business at least to a point Healthcare doesnt fit the traditional supply and demand economic model of capitalism because the demand is always going to be high People are willing to spend whatever it takes to be alive You cant put a price on your life and theres companies know this Need a new heart? Well there isnt a discount store for that heres your bill Need life saving insulin? Well pay our prices because we convinced the government its illegal to go to Canada for 1/10 the price Healthcare and medicine shouldnt be political We put the most into our broken system than any other country and we get the least out of it All we have to do is follow the money and see whos profiting because odds are theyre the ones who stand to lose the most by changing the system Its the same thing with all the sentiment against renewable energy Whos profiting now and whos going to lose out by going to renewable energy?

It gets spent 35% goes towards housing 15% for food And thats before we even bring up the health care industry So 16 trillion was funneled into these institutions in order to keep them afloat but no secret bailouts for the actual citizens Those are the citizens that the government made sure would stay indentured into this life of feckless waste If thats not a conspiracy theory then idk what is,Holystoner42,16201006980,2

At the deepest level I dont believe in the dichotomization of mankind into three categories: (1) Mentally enslaved peasants who see a facade world (2) Elite rulers who understand the real workings of power and (3) enlightened sages who operate outside the system In reality I think were all more like the mentally enslaved peasants Human rationality is pretty limited and it burns insane amounts of calories time and effort to engage with any aspect of reality No one can do it for long People who have political and social power are lucky freaks who have latched onto some heuristics that work (for the moment) They dont really know whats going on either Their power wont last forever and their hurtful choices are often the product of their being as limited and finite as the rest of us Human society looks (to me) like a weird churn of groups of people rising and falling - like a chaotic washing machine Randos figure it out (like the Romans) they rise then they fall as their systems break or their principles become outdated and new groups rise (like Visgoth invasion of Roman Empireand the eventual emergence of the Feudal societythen the consolidation of Church powerand then the fragmentation of the Church and the rise of the nation state) Today we see it in the US The tumbling has made {China United States} {Amazon Google Facebook Haliburton Skynet} {the CIA The Democratic Party & Republic Party} these incredible locuses of power at their respective levels which crudely co-exist in a tense dynamism that is always tumbling around equilibrium But they wont last forever - someday Jeff Bezzos will be dead and the robot or clone they trot out as proof of his immortality will be only nominally Jeff Bezzos Amazon will be a footnote in history the CIA will be gone replaced probably by something even weirder Even the United States will dissolve or be invaded by a foreign power or slide into irrelevancy (perhaps along with the nation-state itselfheres hoping that the era of large-power wars is over and the nation state will slide into irrelevance opening the gates for more and more independent communities and expanding the possibilities for human freedom without bringing about decentralized forms of micro-slavery) Even within any given community theres an unstable hierarchy Join a Church get a corporate job or join a professional organization even in a seemingly flat and parodical organization like your local chapter of Hash House Harriers you still see that theres a churn of people at the top and people not And even seemingly smart or lovable or hard-working folks cant guarantee their spot forever All any of us can do is keep grinding away in our search for truth and goodness trying to be better asking the Benevolent Higher Power(s) for aide and assistance helping others rinse wash and repeat What a world We are lucky to be here If we are,DoktorSpengler,16197978280,2

gx9fl9c,n6w42q,**THE ORIGINS OF CORPORATE SOCIALISM** "Old **John D Rockefeller** and his 19th century fellow-capitalists were convinced of one absolute truth: that no great monetary wealth could be accumulated under the impartial rules of a competitive laissez faire society **The only sure road to the acquisition of massive wealth was monopoly: drive out your competitors reduce competition eliminate laissez-faire and above all get state protection for your industry through compliant politicians and government regulation** This last avenue yields a legal monopoly and a legal monopoly always leads to wealth This robber baron schema is also under different labels the socialist plan The difference between a corporate state monopoly and a socialist state monopoly is essentially only the identity of the group controlling the power structure **The essence of socialism is monopoly control by the state using hired planners and academic sponges On the other hand Rockefeller Morgan and their corporate friends aimed to acquire and control their monopoly and to maximize its profits through influence in the state political apparatus; this while it still needs hired planners and academic sponges is a discreet and far more subtle process than outright state ownership under socialism** Success for the Rockefeller gambit has depended particularly upon **focusing public attention upon largely irrelevant and superficial historical creations such as the myth of a struggle between capitalists and communists** and careful cultivation of political forces by big business We call this phenomenon of **corporate legal monopolymarket control acquired by using political influenceby the name of corporate socialism** The most lucid and frank description of corporate socialism and its mores and objectives is to be found in a 1906 booklet by Frederick Clemson Howe Confessions of a Monopolist" "What is the secret of making great wealth?

gxactiw,n6w42q,There are 17 transnational companies at the top who control well over 42 trillion dollars in investments They have board members of around 200 people that make all the decisions for these companies and they set the financial policies for the world All of the billionaires multimillionaires and most of the millionaires are invested in these companies These people know each other or know of each other Theyre kids go to the same schools While they are competitive they also love money They have discovered that they can make unholy amounts of money not by competing but by working together They collaborate collude to price fix rig scam steal plunder and buy laws that enrich and protect them They use their combined interests in a thug/mafia/mercenary style use of the us army to force countries to bend to their will or else They fill all the important positions in the us government with their own people to further and protect their interests There are other transnational firms very large who also follow what they do They have more money then they know what to do with The problem they have is finding a safe investment with consistent and good returns because they own most everything already This has led them push for and to prolong wars one of the best and safest investment for long term profits This has also led them to take on riskier investments which has been wrecking the economy but they know the government will bail them out The lack of good places to invest has led them to start buying up public institutions for example they want to bankrupt the post office so they can privatize it They want to privatize government infrastructure and the military They are desperately trying to find new ways to bring profits but they have more money than worthwhile places to invest it Bezos gatesmusk and all the names you know are part of these institutions that control the financial system of nearly the entire planet They are not working for the betterment of mankind or for the people They control the us government and nearly all governments to their own enrichment while the names you know contribute to our problems they are not at the top of the power structure they have a voice and play a role in the ruination of lives and planet The real power structure are the transnational investment firms that represent the "combined rich" and decide whats bests for their investments and control both the governments and the laws This doesnt mean the rich cant/wont use their money/power but it means that the bigger power is not what a single billionaire is doing but what the combined group is doing together All billionaires and multi billionaires are heavily invested in at least one of these firms and most millionaires but not all are also invested Theyre business interests are interwoven with each other so trying to interfere or stop them you are not just taking on one of them but these firms have the resources of unimaginable wealth and power behind them They can not be stopped,34831,16204034560,1

h1qdgrf,nzlzfq,Youre absolutely right but its a much more extensive issue that your post taps into: namely the way that the environmental movement (and all of the various environmental groups like Greenpeace) was hijacked by corporations to push the global warming narrative which has completely overshadowed every other environmental issue for activists and which pins the blame on workers and lower classes and lets the corporations escape blame justice or all responsibility for cleaning up the damage they have done to the planet It started with the Thatcher government in the UK she deliberately funded research to prove carbon emissions had a negative impact so that she could break the backs of the coal miners who were striking It was a deliberate strategy to completely destroy organized labour and it worked and her counterpart in USA Ronnie Ray-Gun was busy doing the same thing dismantling any corporate controls and regulations while simultaneously destroying organized labour Both were agents of the new corporate tyranny The Gilets Jaunes movement in France encapsulates this perfectly: how its a class issue and how the global warming legislation hurts working class people Environmental Activists used to protest major corporations and financial institutions and government institutions nuclear power plant protests factory farms oil refineries hijacking pipelines etc but what happened with this psyop is that the shift led to the faux activism of Greta and Extinction Rebellion (which again attacks working class people by blocking them from going to work etc) which mostly replaced and distracted from the real issues The entire debate has been reframed with "deniers" on one side and on the other side if you care about the environment then you affirm the official narrative and therefore agree with the laws Both sides are incorrect because the entire framing is incorrect The way I approach it is I simply focus on the more existential and urgent environmental issues like microplastics in every living being on the plant for instance and 99% of the time these are the direct result of multinational corporations So take the environmental position but just sidestep the framing and address the real issues: nobody can attack you for actually caring about the environment and instead of getting distracted by entangling yourself in the pro or con global warming game just step back and realize its a psyop People are being pushed to fear something that isnt concretely evident to them a narrative that isnt intuitive (the idea that carbon which is necessary for plants is dangerous and an existential threat -- which by the way Im neither affirming nor denying Im simply stating that you cant see it with your own eyes so it becomes a "trust the experts" issue) while the things that are concretely evident like plastic pollution are being demoted to the bottom of the concern list But people can see with their own eyes the way that giant corporations are destroying the planet The evidence is overwhelming Now the next step is to realize that this exact same formula and process applies to every other major issue from war to immigration Start with the shift from class to race/ identity: From 2008-10 there was mass mobilization of workers and activism focused on class (the 99% vs the 1%) where the masses were joining together and attacking wallstreet and giant corporations So again we see the exact same pattern: the Occupy movement being hijacked and overshadowed by BLM and LGBTQ identity politics and also the exact same formula applies to the Covid-19 narrative and the risks and dangers of the virus and also the vaccine The MO is the same (and it also happened in the 60s with COINTELPRO) Its crystal clear once you put it together Chomskys Manufacturing Consent outlines the Modus Operandi for all of these propaganda and psyop campaigns pushed through by corporate media,FruitFlavor12,16236799210,53

i0zezv3,tg0kom,I posted this almost a year ago and have kept copying and pasting it because a lot of it has come true since then Ill warn you its long though This is a copy from another post but lines up the events of history that are being copied right now And why so many *Financial Issues* are being disguised (such as climate issues or pandemic issues) But a lot of this has happened before and is being full-on copied from other time periods and how even blackrock (the single largest hedge fund and called "The Fourth Branch of the US Government by Forbes and Bloomberg) [wrote the entire financial blueprint of what was going to happen before covid even started back in August 2019](https://wwwblackrockcom/corporate/literature/whitepaper/bii-macro-perspectives-august-2019pdf) Were seeing a complete system change why we needed to pump out a ton of money (literally 40% of all Dollars in existence were created in the last year) and why we need a WORLDWIDE unique Identification system tied to single individuals and a unique ID (a passport that is financial in its requirement but right now is being pushed through medical global requirements) Corona is a financial issue disguised as a pandemic issue because it can circumvent local laws and force the wordlwide laws Climate change is a financial issue being disguised as an ecosystem issue because again those laws are "bigger" than local laws and can circumvent normal procedures ----- We know "follow the money" to be the oldest and truest sense of deducing whats going on One of the things that stands out is that this event is following exactly the same events of the 20s and 70s Both times marked by huge inflation both times marked by a currency change and a new system and both times marked by a war that took place to get rid of the old system and expand the system while countries are hit hard by inflation But they all follow the same play ook = a massive amount of money was printed out and a certain assets price was then crashed that people were holding onto In the 20s-30s the asset was gold (whos price skyrocketed as money was printed and then crashed right before a market crash) and now with crypto currency (bitcoin was $7200 in january 2020 and got up to $60000 before crashing down to $32000 and flying back up to $65000 again and will probably crash even further once again before the final drop before it raises to crazy levels in ten years) In the case of gold the conspiracy is that two men formed a group and tried to corner the market and then the US released all its gold shares to crash that market and everyone sold their gold the US then used that price to buy gold from people and then backed the dollar with gold and even made owning it illegal alsoone of those two men who tried cornering the market was the Presidents brother in law so it was clearly a setup and a lot of people lost money but the US gained a lot of gold at cheaper prices right before switching the currency to be backed by gold So it was all about currency So why is the same thing happening again? August was the 50th year anniversary of Nixon ending the gold backed dollar in the 70s and starting the petro backed dollar So what does the end of the currency look like? Remember I said there was a crash for gold because the US released all its stores and crashed the market? Well guess [who owns the most bitcoin](https://wwwwiredcom/2013/12/fbi-wallet/)? Well for starters everyone will need a personal wallet (hence a vaccine passport for tracking is going to come sooner or later but this is the best excuse) The current chair of the SEC (Gary Gensler) who was installed in April taught a class about crypto currency at MIT Sloane (which is an enlightening resource if you want to see how officials view crypto currencies) He even talks about bitcoin finishing a 10 year testing phase and how it survived {what does that even mean? I thought Satoshi Nakamoto was an anonymous person I thought crypto was all about a decentralized financial platform and yet the current head of the SEC says it survived a testing phase?} So what else do we know signifies the end of the petro dollar? Weve all seen how much climate change pops up Well plastics are part of the oil system and thats part of the end too is my guess I know people think its an environmental factor for climate change but we all know that the biggest changes arent happening (a very tiny percentage accounts for the most pollutants but nothing is done about those) But following the money its clear that climate change is a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue This is extremely clear because two separate Senate and house committees met with banks in May about climate changewhy would they meet with banks instead of oil companies or manufacturers? Again the evidence points to a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue But theyre pushing us simply to change what system we consume while avoiding the largest climate change pollutants And even ending the oil system next is energy sourcingwell enter in Afghanistan popping up again and the Taliban/ISIS (which is where the largest lithium deposit is) But the key point is that we will move off of seaparate working grids (because even if you steal gasoline it still works on your vehicle) onto one grid that uses unique identification (which electrical vehicles already do but again is part of the movement away from the machine driven system and into the computer/tracking system) And what about the old infrastructure? Have you noticed how all those hacking attacks kept happening to old infrastructure key points? And the hackers keep asking other countries for huge amount of bitcoin? Have you noticed how war keeps popping up involving all those countries on the old system? Must be a complete coincidence Im sure But well know for sure this is the case if the market crashes soon Hyperinflation is close and technically happening but the FED refuses to acknowledge it (crazy how we dont vote for the FED president and yet they control the entire economy) Weve now had the largest 12 month increase in inflation since 1983 The CPI has changed over and over how inflation is measured true inflation is estimated anywhere from 13% - 25% (but you already know that and likely got your rent hiked already up 20% year-over-year) Thats what happened in the 30s right as they switched to a new backing for the dollar (with Gold) and were seeing all the signs present now that this is true If were about to end the machine driven age and start the computer driven stage then we would each need a unique wallet address and a passport can accompany that It would be the easiest way to install worldwide tracking (since crypto provides a ledger for everything) Also well know bitcoin prices will shoot through the roof after a crash if all this is true and happens Either way this ties corona (an excuse for mass printing of money) the vaccine (more money and a unique wallet tied to ID) end of petro dollar and machine age (climate change is a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue end of plastics from oil) end of the retail to stores system and move to full digital marketplace the beginning of the crypto dollar and crashing the crypto markets (already happened but still can drop much farther along with the rest of the market similar to exact same scenarios in the past) Were entering into the most tracked age of all time everything on the planet will be tracked back to unique ids and monitored on a blockchain/verified by a computer "The Great Reset" might sound like a conspiracy meme but thats an awful lot of coordination to happen in a short period of time Even better since I wrote this the IMF and 10 countries got together in Israel and [Simulated a Cyber Attack that would shut down the Global Financial System](https://financeyahoocom/news/exclusive-imf-10-countries-simulate-133015124html) Im sure thats just a coincidence too! Im sure once it happens everyone will be shocked and demand answersthat they already have Its coming my guess is at the start of Bidens second term since thats when they did it with Nixon Ill keep writing this and if Im wrong I will stop but weve been checking off each point from that paper by Blackrock ever since corona started Every company put money back into their company and was given a massive amount with the PPP loans and every country matched financial and monetary policies and was given massive amounts of money during corona Soif the market started showing signs of a massive failure in 2019 and this paper was put out in August 2019 and weve followed every item line by line of this outline since then and it came before coronathen what does that say about corona This was the single largest robbery in history and unless you are in the 1% then you are going to be the one paying for it You paid for it not just with two full years of your life hearing about this you didnt just pay by having communities torn apart or having to hear people argue about things that arent the actual problem you didnt just pay for it by having to actually stay in solitary confinement that includes the ability to watch your phone and the internetyou literally are going to actually pay for the rest of your life with the inflation costs and debt Well see if this is rightbut weve already checked off most the points from that paper The rich got so insanely rich since this happened It was literally the best year for Wall Street but how was it for most people?,garthsworld,16474938020,2

The occult meaning for that: Not knowing the difference between right & wrong Police officers owners and they *do* have owners put that symbolism there intentionally as a form of mockery They put it directly around police officers brains Their owners laugh hysterically about this behind closed doors The problem is those who work in law enforcement have confused man-made law with actual justice (Natural Law) They dont see the difference - and there is an *enormous* difference They need an understanding of Natural Law and there is a lot of effort put forth to hide knowledge of Natural Law from the public Natural Law is logic-based and contains absolute truths about morality Man-made laws on the other hand involve people writing down that they have "authority" over others and then mind-controlling the public into believing that makes that authority real Of course it doesnt in reality But the reason things like Epsteins death are allowed to happen is because the people working in law enforcement simply do as theyre told by their higher-ups regardless of whether its actually right or wrong No real improvement will occur for humanity in terms of all these conspiracies until far more people begin understanding Natural Law and applying it to their actions instead of believing in the supposed "authority" of government Thats the root of the problem for *all* conspiracies - and the solution We are quickly running out of time to do this And the vast majority of people believe in the legitimacy of the authority of government right now That needs to change Were nowhere near where we need to be with not much time left Anyone reading this please help spread the word about Natural Law Look into it for yourself if you dont know about it,Law_of_1,16197586280,3

Corporations and wealth will just erect the equivalent in its place You can choose limitless freedom of a few to hoard wealth (which is inevitably used against the rest of us) OR you can have democracy and freedom for the rest of us But you cant have both And dividing economic classes by racial lines is one of the ways the wealth class prevents equalizing action,JunkyardSam,16183371380,3

OPIUM WARS - The Original NARCO-COLONIALISM - The Original State Sponsored Drug TrafficStarting in in the mid-1700s the British began trading opium grown in India in exchange for silver from Chinese merchants Opium  an addictive drug that today is refined into heroin  was illegal in England but was used in Chinese traditional medicine 1 https://enwikipediaorg/wiki/Opium\_Wars https://enwikipediaorg/wiki/First\_Opium\_War https://enwikipediaorg/wiki/Second\_Opium\_War 2 This war with China really seems to me so wicked as to be a national sin of the greatest possible magnitude and it distresses me very deeply Cannot any thing be done by petition or otherwise to awaken mens minds to the dreadful guilt we are incurring? I really do not remember in any history of a war undertaken with such combined injustice and baseness Ordinary wars of conquest are to me far less wicked than to go to war in order to maintain smuggling and that smuggling consisting in the introduction of a demoralizing drug which the government of China wishes to keep out and which we for the lucre of gain want to introduce by force; and in this quarrel are going to burn and slay in the pride of our supposed superiority  Thomas Arnold to W W Hull March 18 1840 http://wwwvictorianweborg/history/empire/opiumwars/opiumwars1html 3 https://webarchiveorg/web/20180311121505/https://sacuorg/opium2html See also Opium in China In 1997 the colony of Hong Kong was returned to China Hong Kong Island became a British possession as a direct result of the Opium War the opening shots of which were fired 150 years ago All Chinese regardless of political ideology have condemned this armed confrontation as an unjust and immoral contest As far as they are concerned Britians waging a war for the sake of selling a poisonous drug constitutes the most shameful leaf of human history In the hindsight provided by subsequent events in China it is perhaps easy to condemn this act of British aggression but it is less certain that the event was seen in the same condemnatory light by Chinese and foreign observers a century and a half ago 4 Article on opium trade in 1920s Shanghai http://streetsofshanghaipbworkscom/w/page/18638691/Opium Opium (yapian ) Shanghai was built on the opium trade Before the 1850s Shanghai was the terminal port for coastal opium traffic Shanghai was opened to foreign trade on November 11th 1843 and very soon afterwards Jardines (the biggest British company in China at the time) set up a branch there and hired Chinese compradors one of whom was solely concerned with the supervision of opium By 1845 the opium moving through Shanghai constituted almost half of all the opium imported into China In 1880 nearly 13000000 pounds of opium came into China mainly from India By 1900 imports declined because China was now producing an average of 45000000 pounds of opium per annum itself There were at least 15000000 Chinese opium addicts  in Chengdu there was one opium den for every 67 inhabitants of the city In Shanghai some foreign missionaries began to complain that their homes were almost entirely surrounded by opium dens behind bamboo fences The city had more than eighty shops where the drug was sold openly in its crude form and there were over 1500 opium housesThe owners of these establishments bought their supplies from three major opium firms in the International Settlement  the Zhengxia Guoyu and Liwei All three were owned by Swatow (Chaozhou) merchants who formed a consortium This consortium obtained its opium from four foreign merchant houses: David Sassoon & Co ED Sassoon SJ David and Edward Ezra 5 Opium financed British rule in India http://newsbbccouk/2/hi/south\_asia/7460682stm What did you discover in the course of your research? How big was the trade? Opium steadily accounted for about 17-20% of Indian revenues If you think in those terms \[the fact that\] one single commodity accounted for such an enormous part of your economy is unbelievable extraordinary How and when did opium exports out of India to China begin? The idea of exporting opium to China started with Warren Hastings (the first governor general of British India) in 1780 The situation was eerily similar to \[what is happening\] today There was a huge balance of payments problem in relation to China China was exporting enormous amounts but wasnt interested in importing any European goods That was when Hastings came up with idea that the only way of balancing trade was to export opium to China,shylock92008,16270047200,2
h67hnxn,opbmcz,IS ANYONE APOLOGIZING TO GARY WEBB? by Michael Levine (DEA-RET) Gary Webb just in case youve already forgotten him was the journalist who in a well researched understated article entitled "The Dark Alliance" linked the CIA supported Contras to cocaine and weapons being sold to a California street gang and ended up literally being hounded out of journalism by every mainstream news peddling organization in the Yellow Pages Even his own employer The San Jose Mercury piled on for the kill And guess what? The CIA finally admitted yesterday in the New York Times no less that they in fact did "work with" the Nicaraguan Contras while they had information that they were involved in cocaine trafficking to the United States An action known to us court qualified experts and federal agents as Conspiracy to Import and Distribute Cocainea federal felony punishable by up to life in prison To illustrate how us regular walking around non CIA types are treated when we violate this law while I was serving as a DEA supervisor in New York City I put two New York City police officers in a federal prison for Conspiracy to distribute Cocaine when they looked the other way at their friends drug dealing We could not prove they earned a nickel nor that they helped their friend in any way they merely did not do their duty by reporting him They were sentenced to 10 and 12 years respectively and one of them I was recently told had committed suicide I have spent three decades as a court qualified expert and federal agent and am not aware of any class of American Citizen having special permission to violate the law that we have been taxed over $1 trillion in the past two decades to enforce; the law that every politician bureaucrat and media pundit keeps telling us protects us against the most serious danger to American security in our historyThe interesting thing to me about the Webb article is that the CIA is provably (and now admittedly) responsible for much larger scale drug trafficking than Webb alleged or even imagined in his report In fact according to a confidential DEA report entitled "Operation Hun a Chronology" that I used as part of the proof to back up the undercover experiences detailed in my book The Big White Lie (optioned for a movie by Robert Greenwald Productions) the CIA was actively blocking DEA from indicting many members of the ruling government of Bolivia from 1980-83during a time period that these same people were responsible for producing more than 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States As CIA Inspector General Hitz himself stated before congress it was during this time period that Nicaraguan Contra supporters were buying large amounts of cocaine from these same CIA protected Bolivians Do you think Congress wants to see this proof? The gang that cant spy straight as they are known to my listeners and about whom President Lyndon Johnson once said "When Rich folks dont trust their sons with the family money they send them on down to the CIA" certainly did a lot more damage to this nation than for example computer company owner Will Foster who was sentenced to 93 years in prison for possession of 70 marijuana plants for medicinal use Of course true to their shifty sleazy form while admitting that they did aid and abet Contra drug trafficking they are now refusing to release their own final investigative report which details the damning proof The same report that CIA Inspector General Fredrick Hitz during February 1998 had promised congress and the American people was forthcoming "shortly" because as CIA Director George Tenet now claims CIA does not have enough money in its budget to properly classify it You believe that then I know an old guy with a beard named Fidel wandering the streets of South Miami with an Island about 90 miles off the coast for sale He says the money is for his retirement How you ask do they get away with it? Well for one thing mainstream media the so-called Fourth Estate does all it can to help During the Iran-contra hearings when Senators Kerry and Damato were making pronouncements before the Senate indicating that the CIA was involved with drug trafficking Katherine Graham the owner of The Washington Post addressed a class of CIA recruits at CIAs Langley headquarters in November 1988 by saying: "There are some things the general public does not need to know and shouldnt I believe democracy flourishes when the government can take legitimate steps to keep its secrets and when the press can decide whether to print what it knows" Apparently CIA protection of drug trafficking was among those secrets Thus it should have been no surprise to those CIA agent recruits when Washington Post reporter and drug expert Michael Itsikoff wrote that there was "no credible evidence" linking the CIA supported contras to cocaine trafficking at the same time very credible evidence was being heard by Senator Kerrys committee indicating that the Contras may have been the top purveyors of drugs to Americans in our historyNeither should it have been a surprise to anyone who heard her statement when mainstream media refused to print the news that Oliver North US Ambassador to Costa Rica Lewis Tambs and various top level CIA officers were banned from ever entering Costa Rica by Nobel Prize winning President Oscar Arias for drug running The drugs by the way all going to us Nor should it have been a surprise when Gary Webb was destroyed by mainstream media for doing nothing more or less than telling the truth as he found it And now while CIA admits their felonies to the press but refuses to release the proof and Janet Reno the head of the Obstruction of Justice Department has done the unprecedented by classifying her own departments investigation into CIA drug trafficking the partnership for a Drug Free America is spending $2 billion of our tax money on already-proven-fruitless anti-drug ads And where do you think the money goes?

h6724ku,opbmcz,From 1982 to 1995 the CIA did not to have to report if they suspected any of their agents of dealing drugs Why? Its the kind of government exchange you assume never actually takes place But it did And it went something like this: CIA Chief: Dear Attorney General Do you mind if CIA agents or informants are dealing drugs? I mean we dont have to tell on them do we? Attorney General: Of course not! Well you did But I just changed the law Dont worry about it CIA Chief: Gee thanks! This may sound absurd but according to a series of recently declassified documents obtained by the MoJo Wire its just what happened in the spring of 1982 Letter From Bill Casey To William French Smith https://webarchiveorg/web/20070613130342/https://wwwciagov/library/reports/general-reports-1/cocaine/contra-story/01gif Letter From William French Smith to Bill Casey https://webarchiveorg/web/20070613154234/https://wwwciagov/library/reports/general-reports-1/cocaine/contra-story/02gif Letter from the DOJ Codifying the MOU https://webarchiveorg/web/20070613051429/https://wwwciagov/library/reports/general-reports-1/cocaine/contra-story/14gif Central Intelligence Agency Director William Caseys request to then-Attorney General William French Smith isnt in the public domain But two letters one from Smith thanking Casey for his request and a follow-up by Casey are both available They were released as part of a internal CIA report that explored allegations of CIA involvement in drug trafficking (The most comprehensive allegations were reported by Gary Webb in a series of San Jose Mercury News reports and a book entitled "Dark Alliance") In the first document Smith thanks Casey for his letter (the one that isnt public) and says: "in view of the fine cooperation the Drug Enforcement Administration has received from CIA no formal requirement regarding the reporting of narcotics violations has been included in these procedures"--William French SmithAttorney General Casey in return thanks the Attorney General for his understanding: "I am pleased that these procedures which I believe strike the proper balance between enforcement of the law and protection of intelligence sources and methods will now be forwarded to other agencies"--William J CaseyDirector Central Intelligence Agency\[See the full document\] The two men then codified their agreement in a Memorandum of Understanding According to the agreement intelligence agencies would not have to report if any of their agents were involved in drug running (By agents the agreement meant CIA sources and informants Full-time employees still couldnt deal drugs) That understanding remained in effect until August of 1995 when current Attorney General Janet Reno rescinded the agreement Its reasonable that the CIA be allowed to keep its mouth shut if it knows that some of its agents are involved in minor illegal affairs Presumably some of the value of informants comes from the fact that they keep company with shady characters who engage in unlawful activities But why would the CIA ask to be exempt specifically from drug enforcement laws? According to Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif) who is calling for full disclosure of the facts "The CIA knew that the Contras were dealing drugs They made this deal with the Attorney General to protect themselves from having to report it" Some of the remaining questions may still be answered The Department of Justice and the CIA have finished separate investigations into possible CIA involvement in drug smuggling But neither report has been made available to the public; the Justice department cites an "ongoing investigation" while the CIA says their report is an internal document and therefore classified Says Congresswoman Waters: "What is it they dont want Americans to see? If the CIA was involved in drug trafficking they should be brought to justice Not covered up",shylock92008,16270026170,1

h674p5o,opbmcz,1998: CIA Says It Used Nicaraguan Rebels Accused of Drug Tie; By James Risen July 17 1998 ; "The agencys decision to keep those paid agents or to continue dealing with them in some less formal relationship was made by top officials at headquarters in Langley Va" - NYT  https://wwwnytimescom/1998/07/17/world/cia-says-it-used-nicaraguan-rebels-accused-of-drug-tiehtml CIA Says It Used Nicaraguan Rebels Accused of Drug Tie By James Risen July 17 1998 The Central Intelligence Agency continued to work with about two dozen Nicaraguan rebels and their supporters during the 1980s despite allegations that they were trafficking in drugs according to a classified study by the CIA The new study has found that the agencys decision to keep those paid agents or to continue dealing with them in some less formal relationship was made by top officials at headquarters in Langley Va in the midst of the war waged by the CIA-backed contras against Nicaraguas leftist Sandinista Government The new report by the CIAs inspector general criticizes agency officials actions at the time for the inconsistent and sometimes sloppy manner in which they investigated -- or chose not to investigate -- the allegations which were never substantiated by the agency The inspector generals report which has not yet been publicly released also concludes that there is no evidence that any CIA officials were involved in drug trafficking with contra figures The fundamental finding of the report is that there is no information that the CIA or CIA employees ever conspired with any contra organizations or individuals involved with the contras for purposes of drug trafficking a United States intelligence official said The new report is the long-delayed second volume of the CIAs internal investigation into possible connections between the contras and Central American drug traffickers The investigation was originally prompted by a 1996 series in The San Jose Mercury-News which asserted that a dark alliance between the CIA the contras and drug traffickers had helped finance the contra war with profits from drug smuggling The second volume dismisses those specific charges as did the first volume released in January The series charged that the alliance created a drug trafficking network that introduced crack cocaine into South Central Los Angeles It prompted an enormous outcry especially among blacks many of whom said they saw it as confirmation of a Government-backed conspiracy to keep blacks dependent and impoverished The Mercury-News subsequently admitted that the series was flawed and reassigned the reporter In the declassified version of the CIAs first volume the agency said the Mercury-News charges were baseless and mentioned drug dealers who had nothing to do with the CIA But John M Deutch the Director of Central Intelligence at the time had also asked the inspector general to conduct a broader inquiry to answer unresolved questions about the contra program and drug trafficking that had not been raised by The Mercury-News Frederick Hitz then the CIAs inspector general decided to issue a second larger report to deal with those broader issues Many allegations in the second volume track closely with charges that first surfaced in a 1987 Senate investigation The CIA is reluctant to release the complete 500-page second volume because it deals directly with contras the agency did work with According to the report CIA officials involved in the contra program were so focused on the fight against the Sandinistas that they gave relatively low priority to collecting information about the possible drug involvement of contra rebels The report concluded that CIA officers did report on drug trafficking by the contras but that there were no clear guidelines given to field officers about how intensively they should investigate or act upon the allegations In all the CIA received allegations of drug involvement against about 50 contras or supporters during the war against the Sandinistas the report said Some of the allegations may have been specious the result of Sandinista propaganda American intelligence officials said It could not be determined from the CIAs records how many of the 50 cases were fully investigated But the agency continued to work with about two dozen of the 50 contras according to American intelligence officials familiar with the report They said the report had found that the agency was unable to either prove or disprove the charges or did not investigate them adequately American intelligence officials who provided information about the report declined to identify the individual contras who were the subjects of the drug allegations But they did say that in addition to individual cases the report found that drug allegations had been made against one contra organization a group known as 15th of September That group was formed in 1980 and was disbanded in January 1982 The CIAs decision to classify this second volume has already been met with criticism in Congress Senator John Kerry Democrat of Massachusetts who led a 1987 Congressional inquiry into allegations of contra drug connections wrote a letter Thursday to the Director of Central Intelligence George J Tenet asking that the report be immediately declassified Mr Kerry who has reviewed the second volume of the inspector generals report said he believed that CIA officials involved in the contra program did not make a serious effort to fully investigate the allegations of drug involvement by the contras Some of us in Congress at the time in 1985 1986 were calling for a serious investigation of the charges and CIA officials did not join in that effort Mr Kerry said There was a significant amount of stonewalling Im afraid that what I read in the report documents the degree to which there was a lack of interest in making sure the laws were being upheld A version of this article appears in print on July 17 1998 Section A Page 2 of the National edition

h67hc60,opbmcz,[https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/](https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/) CIA ADMITS TO DEAL WITH JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO OBSTRUCT JUSTICE Michael Levine & Laura Kavanau-Levine THE EXPERT WITNESS radio show March 24 1998 As an ex DEA agent I found the complete lack of coverage by mainstream media of what I saw last night during the congressional hearings into CIA Drug Trafficking on CNN both depressing and frightening I sat gape-mouthed as I heard the CIA Inspector General testify that there has existed a secret agreement between CIA and the Justice Department wherein "during the years 1982 to 1995 CIA did not have to report the drug trafficking its assets did to the Justice Department" (This is the agreement by the way that lead directly to events described in our non-fiction books The Big White Lie and Deep Cover Those many who have read the books will know instantly what I am talking about) To a trained DEA agent this literally means that the CIA had been granted a license to obstruct justice in our so-called war on drugs; a license that lasted-so CIA claims-from 1982 to 1995 a time during which Americans paid almost $150 billion in taxes to "fight" drugs Of course the evidence indicates that they did not stop obstructing justice in 1995 either but that I suppose is going to be another congressional hearing As far as the current hearings go this Catch 22 "revelation" means that all the present hearings are for nothing; that-if they are caught violating the drug laws-they had been given "secret" license to do so by our Justice Department This might also explain Janet Renos recent and unprecedented move in blocking the release of a Justice Department investigation into CIA drug trafficking God with friends like these who needs enemies? I t is now clear that this agreement began with the events described in THE BIG WHITE LIE; that the top drug traffickers in Bolivia then supplying virtually all the worlds cocaine-including Sonia Atala-were CIA assets that had to be protected from our deep cover probe Laura and I still have the proof of this that we used to back up the publication THE BIG WHITE LIE The same proof was later incorporated into other data backing up the publications of DEEP COVER and TRIANGLE OF DEATH [https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/](https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/) Our evidence-which congress has been craning its neck not to see- for instance shows clearly that during Operation Hun (the story in The Big White Lie) secret meetings were held with CIA and Justice Department wherein all indictments of top government officials in Bolivia were blocked We now believe this agreement began because of Operation Hun CIA had to hide the fact that they were supporting the people manufacturing virtually all the cocaine being produced in the world at that time In Deep Cover we showed that during Operation Trifecta-a highly successful deep cover probe into the top of the drug world in three countries (Panama Bolivia and Mexico) -Attorney General of the US Ed Meese found it necessary to warn the Attorney General of Mexico about DEAs case We (undercover DEA agents and Customs agents) found links between top US government officials and the people who murdered DEA agent Kiki Camarena that to this day go unexamined by our congress or anyone else In "TRIANGLE OF DEATH a work of "faction" we showed CIAs real-life involvement in the protection and creation of one of the most murderous criminal organizations to ever plague America an organization created by escaped Nazi fugitives under CIA protection-events occurring long before this alleged CIA Justice agreement And so the dance continues If anyone watched the CNN show you cannot have helped but notice the snickering on the part of Congressional chairman Porter Goss (an ex CIA officer) as congresswoman Maxine Waters spoke Now heres the reason why: Sources of mine who speak to me from inside this veil of secrecy out of conscience and because I am cheaper and more reliable than a psychiatrist have already told me the following: There is secret communication between CIA and members of the Congressional staff-one must keep in mind that Porter Goss the chairman is an ex CIA official- indicating that the whole hearing is just a smoke and mirror show so that the American people-particularly the Black community- can "blow off some steam" without doing any damage to CIA The CIA has been assured that nothing real will be done other than some embarrassing questions being asked That the hearings will result in the CIA receiving even a larger budget than the current $26 billion that they admit to One of the most distressing things for me a 25 year veteran of this business to listen to was when Congresswoman Waters said that the hearings were not about CIA officers being indicted and going to jail "That is not going to happen" she said Almost in the same breath she spoke of a recent case in Miami wherein a Venezuelan National Guard general was caught by Customs agents smuggling more than a ton of cocaine into the US Despite named CIA officers being involved in the plot as Congresswoman Waters stated the Justice Department will not tell her anything about the case because of "secrecy laws" No wonder chairman Goss was snickering She could not have played more neatly into CIA hands than to surrender before the battle was engaged For the entire existence of CIA they have gotten away with doing more damage to the American people than all our traditional enemies combined precisely because no one was ever prosecuted From the CIA protection of Nazi criminals from war crimes prosecution as they set up criminal organizations that preyed on America (Triangle of Death) to their lies to President Kennedy that dragged us into Bay of Pigs to their lies to President Johnson that dragged us into the Vietnam War to their creation of a pan Arab army of American hating drug trafficking terrorists during the Afghan War to the Church Commission hearings to MK-Ultra to the Bolivian Cocaine Coup ("The Big White Lie") to their protection of the worlds top cocaine traffickers as they laid waste to American streets (Deep cover) the CIA has acted exactly as Senator Frank Church once described them: "a runaway rogue elephantcompletely unresponsive to Congressthey (the CIA) have not only been unproductive they have been contra productive they have brought great shame on America" And the dance continues &#x200B; &#x200B; https://npredditcom/r/NarcoFootage/comments/nthcsy/dea6\_by\_dea\_hector\_berrellez\_wayne\_schmidt\_opr/ The KIKI Camarena murder was tied to the use of US intelligence using drug cartel ranches for Contra military training AND Contra/DOD/NSC/Oliver North drug smuggling ring at the same time MEREX Corp supplied arms and other items to the cartel/ It was owned by a Ex Nazi CIA agent named Gerhard Mertins the company also employed Klaus Barbie,shylock92008,16270103370,1

hw497h0,snj9i6,You seem misinformed on the vaccine in general The reason comparing a seatbelt to the vaccine is an analogy is because its similar in some ways but the two are not exactly same And you must remember the context the seatbelt analogy is often brought up as an answer to "why do I need to wear a mask if I already have a vaccine" the answer of course being that we wear seatbelts as well as airbags because we want to improve our chances of not only not passing it on but also not dying You also seem to think that the risk of blood clots in the vaccine are bad would it surprise you to know that the coronavirus as a much much (x10) higher chance of blood clots "necrological disorders" and all manor of other side effects? You also seem to think theyre are some secret "long term results" were still waiting for but this is a strange thought No vaccine before has ever been present in the body for more than 6 months at the absolute most Vaccines as you know are there to train the immune system and dont stay in the body long usually around a month or less With 2 billion+ doses administered we still have no addition side effects so it seems strange to wait for these Covid on the other hand seems very capable of permanently damaging a lot of lung ear nose and throat systems with long term effects like difficult breathing lung capacity smell and taste and many more just being permanently changed Im not sure what "hiding the safety data" the cdc and all the drug agencies have been very forthcoming on all their trials You all even got mad at the cdc for saying there was no evidence of airborne contagion early on and then changing that stance after they researched it and got evidence Same thing with when they said dont wear masks at first as they were no thought at the time to be necessary but new data came out and the cdc adapted its message to the studies The cdc has been reflective of the data from the begining You might be talking about the preprint studies and the VAERS database stuff Those Im sure you have heard are flawed for many reasons their results may be correct or not but we need more data before we can say anything If the researchers and doctors at the head of the preprints or VAERS claims believed that they would want to wait for these studies But we did this cycle with monocoidal antibodies ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine and each time they put in the work for a big double blind study these drugs are reveal to do nothing or so little as to be nothing You also seem very concerned about the companies themselves but for all your conspiracy you dont look at the positives These companies are looking to make big money from government contracts and to get the biggest ones you need an effective vaccine as verified by the FDA and the 40 other countries the vaccine will go too including France Britain Germany and even our enemies China and Russia It in their best interest to make a working vaccine especially because they must compete in a hot market theyre now like 7 different vaccines from different companies so competition is fierce I mean just ask yourself if the vaccine was truly dangerous why wouldnt Russia or China talk about it Or the hundreds of journalists looking for hot stories or any of our allied countries to alter their friends or peoples or the competing companies after their government contract All these people and more would have to work together its impossible,rascalrhett1,16443466010,-4
