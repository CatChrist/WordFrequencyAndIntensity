ho1fm7h,rdg5q3,If anyone thinks that child sex trafficking is fake news then you havent been paying attention to what happens every year in our country and the poorest countries around the world! These people prey on the poor just as they abuse them for work they also use them for their own devious purposes! This is as old as our history MEN have sought out the vulnerable and taken advantage of them and abused them for whatever purpose they wanted! As a survivor of this type of destructive behavior it has taken me a long time to realize that it wasnt my fault but it breaks you down piece by piece until you start self medicating and then you are deemed a delinquent though the judges and lawyers know what happens when a child is thrust into something like this they have no compassion for the children they add abuse on top of the abuse! We have tried to bury this stuff for too long and it is time for those who are elected to protect and serve have to be held accountable and forced to start doing their job! I could tell all of the heart wrenching stories but it will not help to change some of the peoples minds that are in charge! The only time that they come close to caring is when it happens to a child of status and even then they try to bury it! They have the money to pay off the officials in the right places and it just keeps happening! I spent most of my life with anger and self medication and it hasnt really been much help I hope that this is a start to holding them accountable maybe this one woman will open the door for all to see just how pervasive this really is but she is going to have to draw a roadmap to how these people do the things they do!

ho16sji,rdg5q3,So here is my take Ive been reading about satanic sex cults and Pizzagate for about 5 years But Ive really never been given any hard evidence that it all exists What I have found is that the Religious right is very obsessed with grouping sex workers and pornography with "sex trafficking of minors" into the same group this makes it a LOT easier to condemn all 3 and harder to fight against legislation that limits say strip clubs Because if a strip club is a possible "sex ring" then we cant be opposed to THAT right?

Wrong they or their family just were willing to kill or do what ever was necessary to gain the power Even though shit doesnt make since to these normies its to difficult to except how fucked we are I guess or maybe they relate to the evil people and would do the same things if they had the chance I could never blindly listen and obey I question everything around me in the pursuit of knowledge and enlightenment Constantly thinking about how I can improve and better myself with my main focus being to spread love and happiness unity Unfortunately normies are to busy hating each other taking every word said on their favorite MSM source like its the holy gospel It really saddens me how bad this has gotten Dont just believe anything someone is telling you everyone has their own agenda My agenda is to unite and for The People to see how loving each other can change our lives and that we can easily do so much better then the evil people in power Their is only on thing more powerful then hate and that is love The agenda of the evil people who have worked very hard doing what ever neccessary to gain power and money is to keep that power,dillmayne2sweet,16249647110,3

guqfr1c,ms2o0d,What gets me its a couple things about how the system is fucked 1- we tax payers give grant money to smaller pharmaceutical companies The big companies dont want to do research and make medicine for very specific diseases that are rare and only affect a smaller pool of the population they want big net many fish So these smaller companies know this so they know they only way they can compete Id by looking for what disease is getting ignored/not being addressed directly so that becomes their niche But they dont have the money so they get a grant from the government This boosts their budget they increase employment and research and voila theyve created a treatment Now here comes the bigger pharmaceutical companies they see the need medicine and buy out the smaller company They then in turn self the new product at an outrageous price Talk about a winning scenario All you got to do is wait for a smaller company to get grant money do all the work and just buy them So we as tax payers pay to have these medicines made just to then pay for them at a steeper price and we dont get the grant money back 2- There is so much money in lobbying from Pharmaceutical companies (#1 lobbying industry by far) that they were able to convince Congress to vote against themselves being able to negotiate Medicare pharmaceutical prices with those companies A major reason these companies love America is because every other first world country has a system in place to make sure prices dont get out of hand We are their cash cow 3- Along with the pharmaceutical industry the health insurance industry (another top lobbying industry) is also a giant racket that takes advantage of us all These companies have done an amazing job to label things like universal healthcare as "socialist" and yea it might be but they dont care about that they just want you to be afraid of it because it would lead to them losing money The other thing that gets me is people who say "I dont want to pay for your insurance" thing is you already do we already do When an uninsured person goes to the ER they have to be treated When they cant pay the hospital gets that money through the insured by up charging everything Healthcare shouldnt be a for profit business at least to a point Healthcare doesnt fit the traditional supply and demand economic model of capitalism because the demand is always going to be high People are willing to spend whatever it takes to be alive You cant put a price on your life and theres companies know this Need a new heart? Well there isnt a discount store for that heres your bill Need life saving insulin? Well pay our prices because we convinced the government its illegal to go to Canada for 1/10 the price Healthcare and medicine shouldnt be political We put the most into our broken system than any other country and we get the least out of it All we have to do is follow the money and see whos profiting because odds are theyre the ones who stand to lose the most by changing the system Its the same thing with all the sentiment against renewable energy Whos profiting now and whos going to lose out by going to renewable energy?

he wrote a White House official that he was in favor of a "National Endowment in support of free institutions throughout the world" >The NED was initially placed under the auspices of the National Security Council and one Walter Raymond Jr a CIA propaganda expert who according to the late Robert Parry for years acted as liaison between the program and Casey Raymond also drew charming doodles like this depicting himself as a literal puppeteer controlling many different strings >The organization was stacked with prominent neoconservatives like Lane Kirkland John Richardson and Allen Weinstein Carl Gershman a longtime professional anticommunist was its first and so far only president One of its current board members Elliott Abrams is a war criminal with a history of subverting democracy overseas >To prevent the odor of US imperialism from contaminating the NEDs work the Reagan administration made it a private organization that in turn funded several more private institutions including the NDI and IRI But the fact that it was routinely staffed with former US officials and got its funding from the US government has always made this a dubious conceit >Equally dubious was the idea that its task was simply to promote democracy Two of its "core grantees"  which receive around 70 percent of its funding  are explicitly right wing: the IRI which is a GOP-led institution that once described its goals as advancing "democracy the rule of law and free-market economics"; and the Center for International Private Enterprise a project of the **US Chamber of Commerce** Even the Solidarity Center (formerly the Free Trade Union Institute) which is affiliated with the **AFL-CIO** went on to support conservative causes Only the NDI the Democrats arm could be said to be anywhere left of center Overall the NEDs track record tilts decidedly to the right CIPE and The Solidarity Center are two of the four grantees of the [NED](https://wwwsolidaritycenterorg/national-endowment-for-democracy-ned-ndi-iri-cipe-and-solidarity-center-welcome-increased-funding-from-congress/) NED does what the CIA used to do behind closed doors I thought the NED was pretty interesting considering Time Magazines story about the secret shadow campaign to save the [2020 election](https://timecom/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/) The article mentions multiple times how the group was working to protect and save Democracy (democracy is used ~33 times in the article) The article also outlines an alliance that included the AFL-CIO and the US Chamber of Commerce: >The pact was formalized in a terse little-noticed joint statement of the US Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO published on Election Day This article from [socialismcom](https://socialismcom/fs-article/betrayal-from-venezuela-to-iraq-the-afl-cio-and-the-national-endowment-for-democracy/) discusses how NED is a CIA front is funded by the US government and works closely with the leaders of the AFL-CIO: >A little-known far-right organization with a warm and fuzzy name the National Endowment for Democracy is up to no good in at least 40 countries That is bad enough especially given that the money for NEDs dirty deeds comes from working taxpayers courtesy of the US Congress Truly appalling however is the role that leaders of the AFL-CIO the largest US labor federation play in carrying out the work of this agency > A CIA front is born During the late 1970s the CIA was exposed for its active sabotage of numerous governments and progressive labor movements abroad Not so publicized was the AFL-CIOs role in aiding the CIA >Operating through the American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD) the AFL-CIO aided the overthrow of democratically elected governments in Guyana in 1963 Brazil in 1964 the Dominican Republic in 1965 and Chile in 1973 These are just a few examples of labor officialdoms shameful record in helping to carry out corporate-propelled US foreign policy >In 1983 after the CIA was widely discredited Ronald Reagans administration created a new agency the NED to take care of old business As an NED founder Allen Weinstein put it in 1991: "A lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA" >In his hard-hitting book Rogue State: A Guide to the Worlds Only Superpower William Blum describes some of the agencys activities "NED successfully manipulated elections in Nicaragua in 1990 and Mongolia in 1996 helped to overthrow democratically elected governments in Bulgaria in 1990 and Albania in 1991 and 1992 and was busy working in Haiti in the late 1990s on behalf of rightwing groups **NED like the CIA before it calls what it does supporting democracy** The governments and movements whom the NED targets call it destabilization" From the [Time 2020 election story:](https://timecom/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/) >"The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation" says Norm Eisen >The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation >The system didnt work magically Democracy is not self-executing" >And they believe the public needs to understand the systems fragility in order to ensure that democracy in America endures,Settlemente,16187557890,1

Nothing ever really came from it yet other than their arrest and theres no way theyd give up anyone willingly All of the implicated people have denied wrongdoing and its not like the courts have hauled anyone else in They were arrested for trafficking underage girls So where are the arrests of the johns? Or anyone else since this was a criminal network Way too many people knew what was going on for so few to be held accountable The Clintons and Gates know they can always downplay accusations as conspiracy theory nonsense because no one will even investigate them which is pretty crazy when you consider the fact that we actually did haul him into a courtroom before over a stained dress Underage girls being trafficked in order to gain compromising evidence over politicians and other powerful people? Shit should be the permastory that Trump-Russia was for years being constantly covered and dug into (Funny that theres not an endless supply of secret govt sources giving the media juicy bits huh?)

Because the implication that Bezos is just shunting this money from pocket to pocket is wildly inaccurate Even if he could do that the SEC would come down on him like a ton of bricks if he did so Plus Amazon doesnt need the money They can float the $85B to buy MGM all on their own without their founders help Okay so next The tweet says "Senate is considering" which if you understand how the Senate works is code for "some Senator introduced an amendment" but said in a way that tries to make it sound more like the whole Senate is unified in this direction In fact there is an active amendment already being floated to block the previous amendment which amounts to pork-barrelling If you want to learn more about this please check out these articles: * https://theinterceptcom/2021/05/25/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-senate-bailout/ -- "Cantwells amendment is no sure bet [] Bernie Sanders [] introduced a last-minute amendment Monday to eliminate the $10 billion [saying] It does not make a lot of sense to me that we would provide billions of dollars to a company owned by the wealthiest guy in America Sanders told The Intercept Tuesday" * https://wwwwashingtonpostcom/technology/2021/05/21/elon-musk-jeff-bezos-moon-rivalry/ * https://thehillcom/homenews/senate/555426-senate-competitiveness-bill-includes-10b-authorization-for-bezos-space,Tyler_Zoro,16223809920,24

hmqllrs,r602yz,Good on you dude! This is a prime example of how much better society could function if we didnt all just sit around assuming someone else will take care of this issue especially such a morally corrupt one like exploiting kids So many people just assume this is what the FBI or police handle at best theyll report it but then theyll move on and likely that monster continues making a profit on the exploitation of children So its rad to see you actually took it upon yourself to see this through and its great to see at least one piece of filth has now had their legs cut out from beneath them Id be really cautious about working with anyone from the FBI though Especially after recent events seeing how the FBI has been so directly involved with instigating events like the "kidnapping" of Governor Whitmer the January 6 FBI-lead event and the 2020 rioting Not to mention the FBIs history of covering up real proven child trafficking/exploitation operations This isnt even touching all of the speculation (without much evidence) about the FBI being directly involved in protecting the large child trafficking/porn producers if not actively participating in the creation of it themselves Not to say the ***entire*** FBI is corrupt filled with monsters who wont just ignore these sorts of charges theyll actively work to cover-up and bury it then silence you But it certainly seems like the integral cogs in the FBI machine are not very concerned with really digging deep into who operates the major trafficking/child porn productioncould be theyre involved in the facilitation themselves or the sad reality the FBI is morally corrupt ineffectual dinosaur institution who will no longer or can no longer uphold their duty to justice :/,flichter,16383217060,6

h88st99,p0j98z,The world is like a ride in an amusement park and when you choose to go on it you think its real because thats how powerful our minds are The ride goes up and down around and around it has thrills and chills and its very brightly colored and its very loud and its fun for a while Many people have been on the ride a long time and they begin to wonder "Hey is this real or is this just a ride?" And other people have remembered and they come back to us and say "Hey dont worry; dont be afraid ever because this is just a ride" And we  kill those people "Shut him up! Ive got a lot invested in this ride shut him up! Look at my furrows of worry look at my big bank account and my family This has to be real" Its just a ride But we always kill the good guys who try and tell us that you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok  But it doesnt matter because its just a ride And we can change it any time we want Its only a choice No effort no work no job no savings of money Just a simple choice right now between fear and love The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors buy guns close yourself off The eyes of love instead see all of us as one Heres what we can do to change the world right now to a better ride Take all that money we spend on weapons and defenses each year and instead spend it feeding and clothing and educating the poor of the world which it would pay for many times over not one human being excluded and we could explore space together both inner and outer forever in peace,QuotesBillHicks,16284780350,29

h1qdgrf,nzlzfq,Youre absolutely right but its a much more extensive issue that your post taps into: namely the way that the environmental movement (and all of the various environmental groups like Greenpeace) was hijacked by corporations to push the global warming narrative which has completely overshadowed every other environmental issue for activists and which pins the blame on workers and lower classes and lets the corporations escape blame justice or all responsibility for cleaning up the damage they have done to the planet It started with the Thatcher government in the UK she deliberately funded research to prove carbon emissions had a negative impact so that she could break the backs of the coal miners who were striking It was a deliberate strategy to completely destroy organized labour and it worked and her counterpart in USA Ronnie Ray-Gun was busy doing the same thing dismantling any corporate controls and regulations while simultaneously destroying organized labour Both were agents of the new corporate tyranny The Gilets Jaunes movement in France encapsulates this perfectly: how its a class issue and how the global warming legislation hurts working class people Environmental Activists used to protest major corporations and financial institutions and government institutions nuclear power plant protests factory farms oil refineries hijacking pipelines etc but what happened with this psyop is that the shift led to the faux activism of Greta and Extinction Rebellion (which again attacks working class people by blocking them from going to work etc) which mostly replaced and distracted from the real issues The entire debate has been reframed with "deniers" on one side and on the other side if you care about the environment then you affirm the official narrative and therefore agree with the laws Both sides are incorrect because the entire framing is incorrect The way I approach it is I simply focus on the more existential and urgent environmental issues like microplastics in every living being on the plant for instance and 99% of the time these are the direct result of multinational corporations So take the environmental position but just sidestep the framing and address the real issues: nobody can attack you for actually caring about the environment and instead of getting distracted by entangling yourself in the pro or con global warming game just step back and realize its a psyop People are being pushed to fear something that isnt concretely evident to them a narrative that isnt intuitive (the idea that carbon which is necessary for plants is dangerous and an existential threat -- which by the way Im neither affirming nor denying Im simply stating that you cant see it with your own eyes so it becomes a "trust the experts" issue) while the things that are concretely evident like plastic pollution are being demoted to the bottom of the concern list But people can see with their own eyes the way that giant corporations are destroying the planet The evidence is overwhelming Now the next step is to realize that this exact same formula and process applies to every other major issue from war to immigration Start with the shift from class to race/ identity: From 2008-10 there was mass mobilization of workers and activism focused on class (the 99% vs the 1%) where the masses were joining together and attacking wallstreet and giant corporations So again we see the exact same pattern: the Occupy movement being hijacked and overshadowed by BLM and LGBTQ identity politics and also the exact same formula applies to the Covid-19 narrative and the risks and dangers of the virus and also the vaccine The MO is the same (and it also happened in the 60s with COINTELPRO) Its crystal clear once you put it together Chomskys Manufacturing Consent outlines the Modus Operandi for all of these propaganda and psyop campaigns pushed through by corporate media,FruitFlavor12,16236799210,53

hia4rs5,qh1mh5,Adderall is similar to methamphetamine but so is phenylethylamine a common additive to energy drinks and pre-workout The brains of those with adhd is visibly and markedly different structurally and functionally There is far less circulating dopamine norepinephrine and serotonin than in the neurotypical Stimulants like adderall increase the circulating volume of dopamine and bring the adhd brain up to a level of functionality that most enjoy There is no science of any kind to support the idea that this condition can simply be reduced to "not wanting to sit still" Also with behavior modification adderall prescribed in the developmental window increases neuroplasticity allowing for the adhd sufferer to develop the structural/functional abilities to focus and improve executive functioning Dont offer cartoonish reductionism simply because you are ignorant of the neuroscience of the condition,deadwards14,16353605670,49

i0zezv3,tg0kom,I posted this almost a year ago and have kept copying and pasting it because a lot of it has come true since then Ill warn you its long though This is a copy from another post but lines up the events of history that are being copied right now And why so many *Financial Issues* are being disguised (such as climate issues or pandemic issues) But a lot of this has happened before and is being full-on copied from other time periods and how even blackrock (the single largest hedge fund and called "The Fourth Branch of the US Government by Forbes and Bloomberg) [wrote the entire financial blueprint of what was going to happen before covid even started back in August 2019](https://wwwblackrockcom/corporate/literature/whitepaper/bii-macro-perspectives-august-2019pdf) Were seeing a complete system change why we needed to pump out a ton of money (literally 40% of all Dollars in existence were created in the last year) and why we need a WORLDWIDE unique Identification system tied to single individuals and a unique ID (a passport that is financial in its requirement but right now is being pushed through medical global requirements) Corona is a financial issue disguised as a pandemic issue because it can circumvent local laws and force the wordlwide laws Climate change is a financial issue being disguised as an ecosystem issue because again those laws are "bigger" than local laws and can circumvent normal procedures ----- We know "follow the money" to be the oldest and truest sense of deducing whats going on One of the things that stands out is that this event is following exactly the same events of the 20s and 70s Both times marked by huge inflation both times marked by a currency change and a new system and both times marked by a war that took place to get rid of the old system and expand the system while countries are hit hard by inflation But they all follow the same play ook = a massive amount of money was printed out and a certain assets price was then crashed that people were holding onto In the 20s-30s the asset was gold (whos price skyrocketed as money was printed and then crashed right before a market crash) and now with crypto currency (bitcoin was $7200 in january 2020 and got up to $60000 before crashing down to $32000 and flying back up to $65000 again and will probably crash even further once again before the final drop before it raises to crazy levels in ten years) In the case of gold the conspiracy is that two men formed a group and tried to corner the market and then the US released all its gold shares to crash that market and everyone sold their gold the US then used that price to buy gold from people and then backed the dollar with gold and even made owning it illegal alsoone of those two men who tried cornering the market was the Presidents brother in law so it was clearly a setup and a lot of people lost money but the US gained a lot of gold at cheaper prices right before switching the currency to be backed by gold So it was all about currency So why is the same thing happening again? August was the 50th year anniversary of Nixon ending the gold backed dollar in the 70s and starting the petro backed dollar So what does the end of the currency look like? Remember I said there was a crash for gold because the US released all its stores and crashed the market? Well guess [who owns the most bitcoin](https://wwwwiredcom/2013/12/fbi-wallet/)? Well for starters everyone will need a personal wallet (hence a vaccine passport for tracking is going to come sooner or later but this is the best excuse) The current chair of the SEC (Gary Gensler) who was installed in April taught a class about crypto currency at MIT Sloane (which is an enlightening resource if you want to see how officials view crypto currencies) He even talks about bitcoin finishing a 10 year testing phase and how it survived {what does that even mean? I thought Satoshi Nakamoto was an anonymous person I thought crypto was all about a decentralized financial platform and yet the current head of the SEC says it survived a testing phase?} So what else do we know signifies the end of the petro dollar? Weve all seen how much climate change pops up Well plastics are part of the oil system and thats part of the end too is my guess I know people think its an environmental factor for climate change but we all know that the biggest changes arent happening (a very tiny percentage accounts for the most pollutants but nothing is done about those) But following the money its clear that climate change is a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue This is extremely clear because two separate Senate and house committees met with banks in May about climate changewhy would they meet with banks instead of oil companies or manufacturers? Again the evidence points to a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue But theyre pushing us simply to change what system we consume while avoiding the largest climate change pollutants And even ending the oil system next is energy sourcingwell enter in Afghanistan popping up again and the Taliban/ISIS (which is where the largest lithium deposit is) But the key point is that we will move off of seaparate working grids (because even if you steal gasoline it still works on your vehicle) onto one grid that uses unique identification (which electrical vehicles already do but again is part of the movement away from the machine driven system and into the computer/tracking system) And what about the old infrastructure? Have you noticed how all those hacking attacks kept happening to old infrastructure key points? And the hackers keep asking other countries for huge amount of bitcoin? Have you noticed how war keeps popping up involving all those countries on the old system? Must be a complete coincidence Im sure But well know for sure this is the case if the market crashes soon Hyperinflation is close and technically happening but the FED refuses to acknowledge it (crazy how we dont vote for the FED president and yet they control the entire economy) Weve now had the largest 12 month increase in inflation since 1983 The CPI has changed over and over how inflation is measured true inflation is estimated anywhere from 13% - 25% (but you already know that and likely got your rent hiked already up 20% year-over-year) Thats what happened in the 30s right as they switched to a new backing for the dollar (with Gold) and were seeing all the signs present now that this is true If were about to end the machine driven age and start the computer driven stage then we would each need a unique wallet address and a passport can accompany that It would be the easiest way to install worldwide tracking (since crypto provides a ledger for everything) Also well know bitcoin prices will shoot through the roof after a crash if all this is true and happens Either way this ties corona (an excuse for mass printing of money) the vaccine (more money and a unique wallet tied to ID) end of petro dollar and machine age (climate change is a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue end of plastics from oil) end of the retail to stores system and move to full digital marketplace the beginning of the crypto dollar and crashing the crypto markets (already happened but still can drop much farther along with the rest of the market similar to exact same scenarios in the past) Were entering into the most tracked age of all time everything on the planet will be tracked back to unique ids and monitored on a blockchain/verified by a computer "The Great Reset" might sound like a conspiracy meme but thats an awful lot of coordination to happen in a short period of time Even better since I wrote this the IMF and 10 countries got together in Israel and [Simulated a Cyber Attack that would shut down the Global Financial System](https://financeyahoocom/news/exclusive-imf-10-countries-simulate-133015124html) Im sure thats just a coincidence too! Im sure once it happens everyone will be shocked and demand answersthat they already have Its coming my guess is at the start of Bidens second term since thats when they did it with Nixon Ill keep writing this and if Im wrong I will stop but weve been checking off each point from that paper by Blackrock ever since corona started Every company put money back into their company and was given a massive amount with the PPP loans and every country matched financial and monetary policies and was given massive amounts of money during corona Soif the market started showing signs of a massive failure in 2019 and this paper was put out in August 2019 and weve followed every item line by line of this outline since then and it came before coronathen what does that say about corona This was the single largest robbery in history and unless you are in the 1% then you are going to be the one paying for it You paid for it not just with two full years of your life hearing about this you didnt just pay by having communities torn apart or having to hear people argue about things that arent the actual problem you didnt just pay for it by having to actually stay in solitary confinement that includes the ability to watch your phone and the internetyou literally are going to actually pay for the rest of your life with the inflation costs and debt Well see if this is rightbut weve already checked off most the points from that paper The rich got so insanely rich since this happened It was literally the best year for Wall Street but how was it for most people?,garthsworld,16474938020,2

h1tkxz7,nzya2n,I have serious doubts that this guy was pulling the trigger Ive watched several videos of people claiming the shots were coming from multiple directions from above And for some reason I cant find body cam footage of the actual breech showing Paddock already dead I mean really they cant use "due to the graphic nature we will not release it" as an excuse considering they have no problem releasing some pretty gruesome footage if it suits their story Additionally in any of the footage I have found that was shortly after said breech I cant see a shattered window in any of them most curtains are drawn and not a breeze flowing at all If you have any definitive footage I would really appreciate it But as of now I think this was staged and Paddock was the fall guy Anyways I think you have done some fantastic work and will be going through the video archive What would be cool is a reenactment based on the data portraying his position in the hotel to where shots were fired and where people were wounded / killed at specific intervals Apparently he also paused to shoot through the hotel room door when an employee was standing outside the doorSeems odd that in the middle of a shooting spree hes also monitoring camera footage outside his hotel roomNow would have to image that hes got a surveillance system set up and within view while hes firing into a crowdWheres the footage showing this surveillance tech? Lots of holes or at least unanswered questions Also I read that he allegedly had child porn on his computer Perhaps the motive to at least make him the scapegoat under threat of being exposed?,fortmacjack99,16237382040,7

gwe22ao,n13x8h,Law enforcement in itself is not about justice Theyre order-followers And order-followers do as theyre told with no thought of their own about whether its right or wrong - for a paycheck Once you understand who is *really* giving the orders the Epstein situation makes perfect sense Heres a clue: Notice the black & white chess-board symbolism police wear around their heads? The occult meaning for that: Not knowing the difference between right & wrong Police officers owners and they *do* have owners put that symbolism there intentionally as a form of mockery They put it directly around police officers brains Their owners laugh hysterically about this behind closed doors The problem is those who work in law enforcement have confused man-made law with actual justice (Natural Law) They dont see the difference - and there is an *enormous* difference They need an understanding of Natural Law and there is a lot of effort put forth to hide knowledge of Natural Law from the public Natural Law is logic-based and contains absolute truths about morality Man-made laws on the other hand involve people writing down that they have "authority" over others and then mind-controlling the public into believing that makes that authority real Of course it doesnt in reality But the reason things like Epsteins death are allowed to happen is because the people working in law enforcement simply do as theyre told by their higher-ups regardless of whether its actually right or wrong No real improvement will occur for humanity in terms of all these conspiracies until far more people begin understanding Natural Law and applying it to their actions instead of believing in the supposed "authority" of government Thats the root of the problem for *all* conspiracies - and the solution We are quickly running out of time to do this And the vast majority of people believe in the legitimacy of the authority of government right now That needs to change Were nowhere near where we need to be with not much time left Anyone reading this please help spread the word about Natural Law Look into it for yourself if you dont know about it,Law_of_1,16197586280,3

I get so frustrated seeing people so politically divided everywhere even here When are people going to realize its not really about left or right Its about the working class vs the elites Politicians on both sides are corrupt elitist bastards who absolutely do not care about the average man or his needs They do not plan on doing anything except sticking to the status quo and then whispering in your ear that its not their fault things havent changed Its the other sides fault They benefit when were distracted by identity politics and war among ourselves They want us too busy fighting with each other to pay attention to them The more we let left/right or black/white divide us the better off they are,vannah12222,16436479110,8
hv0rwi9,sh2zq9,Well said OP Your wider point is spot on as well as your point about book burning and this sub Remember this and only this people Conservatives and the right wing has nothing to offer you If youre part of the 1% and can benefit from Reaganomics and top earner tax cuts then great youre insulated from the system But the average working guy? Or even a middle class family The conservatives have nothing to offer you to make your life better At all So they co-opt endless culture wars and conspiracies and when one has spent enough political capital and is dry they move on to the next one Drag Queens gay marriage CRT Mr Potato head and so on Republicans and right wingers offer nothing to improve your life at all Stock market?

hv1ifjq,sh2zq9,So what i see are comments like "this sub is a far right echo camber" which gets heavily upvoted which contradicts that claim No nuance when it comes to "bans" some are just not mandetory readed while others get removed from libary Reinforing the "its all antivaxx now" when the term antivaxx is a propaganda term pushed by corperate media Everyone long enough in this sub has seen the massive corruption and change of narratives and the narrative control around this vaccines Republicans will not be the solution even if they now push hard that they are the party of freedom I think the left made a big mistake letting all critique on bigpharma for the right the right will probably get the majority in the upcoming years simply for this But also because they stand against the woke agenda They use a few videos of woke teachers to portrai that most teachers are like this (And please dont defend the woke agenda its a rascist and sexist worldview and keeps the worklingclass divided) The best explanation i read is that everything that happens now is the beginning of the end of the us empire Massive focus on identity gender race rejection of any traditional moral views the massive problems with the currency All this happened to previous empires before their fall But its a long process it can easily go for 50years,nelbar,16436617050,8

hv0k8tc,sh2zq9,I had this conversation/discussion a few weeks back I asked the question of how is it allowable that a public library or a public school could ban books? They are arms of the state and therefor the first amendment applies to them It should be grossly unconstitutional for them to be allowed to ban *any* books I was met with "well you dont want a fourth grader reading 50 shades right? Some books are inappropriate" And yes I agree some books are inappropriate Except that I believe if a teacher can turn a book into a learning experience why should we just ban that book?

Is detention inprisionment? If folks wanted to load up school libraries with Nazi propaganda can they? Would Democrats be "burning books" if they removed them? This post sounds partisan It sounds like "my tyranny is better than the conservatives tyranny" You need to remember what a school is It is not an enlightened public square of freedom where anything goes It is a state institution that looks similar to prisons with strict guidelines to make kids obedient It is designed to be propaganda camp and train kids to work for a corporation or big gov until death As long as schools are this big tyrannical force i dont see how changing the type of propaganda will make much of a difference Counter culture IS the culture,zuko7891,16436635830,1

I think thats a pretty decent probability in my opinion but Im just throwing it out there as food for thought Not a counter point per se but I think were doing ourselves a disservice if we dont consider some different possibilities with this situation And given the possible manufactured nature of Epsteins persona (nobody knows where he got his money seems to just show up in power circles is handled by law enforcement as an intelligence asset and is disappeared/murdered when captured to name a few) Ive caught myself wondering if Epstein himself was not a propped up ready to go expendable patsy I could even see a scenario where he may have thought he was setting up pedophiles like working for law enforcement Just to be clear Im NOT saying I believe that Im just saying there seems to be a lot more nuance to this situation than a lot of people want to acknowledge That is all I believe in casting a wide net and working from that Nothing more nothing less I think it helps That certainly would not make him a good guy (just to be clear again lol) but when you think of this case that way it opens up some interesting possibilities To believe that Epstein was the pinnacle here (in any way) is to take our eyes off the ball This guy was working for some entity My point in saying this is Epstein most definitely could be just a prop and always a cut out to take the fall that is a well known practice for these types I think there is just as much to indicate that Maxwell was the one in charge as there ever was that Epstein was the head of this Or it could go much deeper than that (very likely IMO) Thanks again for posting OP And take all of what Ive typed here with a spirit of being helpful because that is how it is meant,Flop_McKochen,16381184880,95

hmf92b3,r45a5n,So I presume everyone who hangs out in a place like this understands *what* exactly Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeff Epstein *were* They were spies working for a foreign nation who utilized child sex slaves as one means of extortion and control over their targets Their targets included at least one US administration which they successfully controlled They also included field-leading scientists in areas ranging from genetics through cryptography media social media all the way to orbital launch and space flight In the world of espionage there are assets agents who develop the assets case officers who develop and manage the agents and powers that tell the case officers what to do Layers of separation meant to keep the hands of the shot-callers clean Epstein was an asset; Maxwell was an agent Both quite obviously worked for Mossad The Maxwell-Epstein team even targeted Elon Musk though apparently unsuccessfully much like the Bronfman-sponsored NXIVM mind control/sex traffic cult team successfully targeted Richard Branson of Virgin fame even celebrating their capture by holding parties on Bransons private island [They had predecessors](https://iimgurcom/gH04jObjpg) who controlled previous US administrations through similar means The existence of such creatures across the breadth of US history suggests that there are most likely teams doing similar things currently in operation One such team recently targeted congressman Matt Gaetz; their operation was disrupted and two members of their team are already in federal custody The rest are known Now you must understand something else While Ghislaine Maxwells cell of this team has been deactivated there are remnant cells in the form of Maxwells sisters who wrote much of the code the US government uses at a federal level to track the movements of people keep out terrorists and keep the borders of America secure This granted the Maxwell team the ability to traffic in humans in undetectable fashion around the world as well as facilitate the completely clandestine movements of VIPs around the world In short not the kind of people you want in charge of your fundamental natsec backbone software Now you understand why Maxwell had a pilots and a submariners license Now you understand why Nadia Marcinkova another member of the Maxwell-Epstein team remains a pilot and remains at large Now you understand why all the other members of the Maxwell-Epstein team are still at large: theyre completely in charge of your government those higher powers that tell the cells what to do and whom to target Woodrow Wilson had a relevant quote about these hidden powers,KorvaxNaniteJelly,16381213780,66

h6bceli,oq0kxg,For those that complain of capitalism or communism or what not the real issue is the kid raising system Lets pretend you want to be a millionaire by 30 In a college system with $100k of debt starting at 22 you basically need to earn around $150k per year after taxes and expenses to get to $1 Mil by 30 if investments go well etc (about doubling) Now remove college all together Instead of $150k you need like $90k Now imagine you take a kid and instead of the asinine question what do you want to do (all girls : animals community kids environment all boys : outdoor guy what my dad did) - and instead say what do you want to have This is what I do They always want a nice car vs shit car They want a happy spouse with kids vs alone and desperate They want to be able to afford medicines vs bothering family with a go fund me Its a relatively easy decision; lots of money better There are actually a LOT of careers that pay $90k without a degree Now if you plan for this you get them as an apprentice BUT ONLY for careers that pay $60k base and $200k tops like computers legal finance media & medical I had a dancing girlfriend that became a doctor simply by working at Walgreens She of course had no concept of what being a doctor was but after the pharmacist kept giving her money driving a nice car and invited her to her nice house - boom she became a doctor (internally) It was easy But more to the point I got this trailer kid that I sponsored over a few years who will be making $60k at 18 in computers - all I had to do was pay him $100 or so at a time for computer work here and there roughly what I would have paid someone else He *might* be a millionaire by 30 working full time in computers at 18 with what is normally referred to as the best resume theyve seen - and thats even when he slacked off (his dad gets him drunk weekly and his aunt keeps telling him to spend the next several years getting high and going to music shows thats what life is about!) - I did help him start his own business but he never did the professional networking meetings I suggested And the Key to all this? Benjamin Franklins Autobiography!!! Seriously!!! In it is a quick self study guide (13 virtues) to teach you to not be a dick Then there is the Junto system to make you network and listen to others and learn from them share with them in a constructive way And the final piece of the Benjamin Franklin system was to teach kids (nephews in his day) your skills when they were about 15 Then invest in them enough to start a shop (like $20K say) Then they pay you 50% of profits the next several years In Franklins system he went from poor as fuck to worker (18) - $30k (in todays money) - to extremely good worker living healthy connected and disciplined - shop manager (21) $60k - But the kicker at 32 he invested in 3 nephews basically This is where he made all his money Those nephews were also printers like him By 37 he was retired - and most of his inventions & political involvement happened after 37 (1740) And it was Franklin *the most* responsible for the AM Revolution cause he taught people how to make a fuck ton of money basically (and not to be assholes - EI self governing) Meh dribble but if you do something similar to what the Swiss do today where the average professional salary *is actually* $200000 then ALL of economics solves itself But they force kids into smart apprenticeship programs at 15 Thats the biggest difference The good kids are in professional clubs by 17 This is 100% normal Making $60k out of a Swiss high school is absolutely the norm and the reason the main reason they have such immense wealth Literally every nation could copy this approach and not take away from anyone else but we dont for whatever reason but you should do so with your kids always,Bitcoin1776,16270878610,1

I really do not remember in any history of a war undertaken with such combined injustice and baseness Ordinary wars of conquest are to me far less wicked than to go to war in order to maintain smuggling and that smuggling consisting in the introduction of a demoralizing drug which the government of China wishes to keep out and which we for the lucre of gain want to introduce by force; and in this quarrel are going to burn and slay in the pride of our supposed superiority  Thomas Arnold to W W Hull March 18 1840 http://wwwvictorianweborg/history/empire/opiumwars/opiumwars1html 3 https://webarchiveorg/web/20180311121505/https://sacuorg/opium2html See also Opium in China In 1997 the colony of Hong Kong was returned to China Hong Kong Island became a British possession as a direct result of the Opium War the opening shots of which were fired 150 years ago All Chinese regardless of political ideology have condemned this armed confrontation as an unjust and immoral contest As far as they are concerned Britians waging a war for the sake of selling a poisonous drug constitutes the most shameful leaf of human history In the hindsight provided by subsequent events in China it is perhaps easy to condemn this act of British aggression but it is less certain that the event was seen in the same condemnatory light by Chinese and foreign observers a century and a half ago 4 Article on opium trade in 1920s Shanghai http://streetsofshanghaipbworkscom/w/page/18638691/Opium Opium (yapian ) Shanghai was built on the opium trade Before the 1850s Shanghai was the terminal port for coastal opium traffic Shanghai was opened to foreign trade on November 11th 1843 and very soon afterwards Jardines (the biggest British company in China at the time) set up a branch there and hired Chinese compradors one of whom was solely concerned with the supervision of opium By 1845 the opium moving through Shanghai constituted almost half of all the opium imported into China In 1880 nearly 13000000 pounds of opium came into China mainly from India By 1900 imports declined because China was now producing an average of 45000000 pounds of opium per annum itself There were at least 15000000 Chinese opium addicts  in Chengdu there was one opium den for every 67 inhabitants of the city In Shanghai some foreign missionaries began to complain that their homes were almost entirely surrounded by opium dens behind bamboo fences The city had more than eighty shops where the drug was sold openly in its crude form and there were over 1500 opium housesThe owners of these establishments bought their supplies from three major opium firms in the International Settlement  the Zhengxia Guoyu and Liwei All three were owned by Swatow (Chaozhou) merchants who formed a consortium This consortium obtained its opium from four foreign merchant houses: David Sassoon & Co ED Sassoon SJ David and Edward Ezra 5 Opium financed British rule in India http://newsbbccouk/2/hi/south\_asia/7460682stm What did you discover in the course of your research? How big was the trade? Opium steadily accounted for about 17-20% of Indian revenues If you think in those terms \[the fact that\] one single commodity accounted for such an enormous part of your economy is unbelievable extraordinary How and when did opium exports out of India to China begin? The idea of exporting opium to China started with Warren Hastings (the first governor general of British India) in 1780 The situation was eerily similar to \[what is happening\] today There was a huge balance of payments problem in relation to China China was exporting enormous amounts but wasnt interested in importing any European goods That was when Hastings came up with idea that the only way of balancing trade was to export opium to China,shylock92008,16270047200,2
h67hnxn,opbmcz,IS ANYONE APOLOGIZING TO GARY WEBB? by Michael Levine (DEA-RET) Gary Webb just in case youve already forgotten him was the journalist who in a well researched understated article entitled "The Dark Alliance" linked the CIA supported Contras to cocaine and weapons being sold to a California street gang and ended up literally being hounded out of journalism by every mainstream news peddling organization in the Yellow Pages Even his own employer The San Jose Mercury piled on for the kill And guess what? The CIA finally admitted yesterday in the New York Times no less that they in fact did "work with" the Nicaraguan Contras while they had information that they were involved in cocaine trafficking to the United States An action known to us court qualified experts and federal agents as Conspiracy to Import and Distribute Cocainea federal felony punishable by up to life in prison To illustrate how us regular walking around non CIA types are treated when we violate this law while I was serving as a DEA supervisor in New York City I put two New York City police officers in a federal prison for Conspiracy to distribute Cocaine when they looked the other way at their friends drug dealing We could not prove they earned a nickel nor that they helped their friend in any way they merely did not do their duty by reporting him They were sentenced to 10 and 12 years respectively and one of them I was recently told had committed suicide I have spent three decades as a court qualified expert and federal agent and am not aware of any class of American Citizen having special permission to violate the law that we have been taxed over $1 trillion in the past two decades to enforce; the law that every politician bureaucrat and media pundit keeps telling us protects us against the most serious danger to American security in our historyThe interesting thing to me about the Webb article is that the CIA is provably (and now admittedly) responsible for much larger scale drug trafficking than Webb alleged or even imagined in his report In fact according to a confidential DEA report entitled "Operation Hun a Chronology" that I used as part of the proof to back up the undercover experiences detailed in my book The Big White Lie (optioned for a movie by Robert Greenwald Productions) the CIA was actively blocking DEA from indicting many members of the ruling government of Bolivia from 1980-83during a time period that these same people were responsible for producing more than 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States As CIA Inspector General Hitz himself stated before congress it was during this time period that Nicaraguan Contra supporters were buying large amounts of cocaine from these same CIA protected Bolivians Do you think Congress wants to see this proof? The gang that cant spy straight as they are known to my listeners and about whom President Lyndon Johnson once said "When Rich folks dont trust their sons with the family money they send them on down to the CIA" certainly did a lot more damage to this nation than for example computer company owner Will Foster who was sentenced to 93 years in prison for possession of 70 marijuana plants for medicinal use Of course true to their shifty sleazy form while admitting that they did aid and abet Contra drug trafficking they are now refusing to release their own final investigative report which details the damning proof The same report that CIA Inspector General Fredrick Hitz during February 1998 had promised congress and the American people was forthcoming "shortly" because as CIA Director George Tenet now claims CIA does not have enough money in its budget to properly classify it You believe that then I know an old guy with a beard named Fidel wandering the streets of South Miami with an Island about 90 miles off the coast for sale He says the money is for his retirement How you ask do they get away with it? Well for one thing mainstream media the so-called Fourth Estate does all it can to help During the Iran-contra hearings when Senators Kerry and Damato were making pronouncements before the Senate indicating that the CIA was involved with drug trafficking Katherine Graham the owner of The Washington Post addressed a class of CIA recruits at CIAs Langley headquarters in November 1988 by saying: "There are some things the general public does not need to know and shouldnt I believe democracy flourishes when the government can take legitimate steps to keep its secrets and when the press can decide whether to print what it knows" Apparently CIA protection of drug trafficking was among those secrets Thus it should have been no surprise to those CIA agent recruits when Washington Post reporter and drug expert Michael Itsikoff wrote that there was "no credible evidence" linking the CIA supported contras to cocaine trafficking at the same time very credible evidence was being heard by Senator Kerrys committee indicating that the Contras may have been the top purveyors of drugs to Americans in our historyNeither should it have been a surprise to anyone who heard her statement when mainstream media refused to print the news that Oliver North US Ambassador to Costa Rica Lewis Tambs and various top level CIA officers were banned from ever entering Costa Rica by Nobel Prize winning President Oscar Arias for drug running The drugs by the way all going to us Nor should it have been a surprise when Gary Webb was destroyed by mainstream media for doing nothing more or less than telling the truth as he found it And now while CIA admits their felonies to the press but refuses to release the proof and Janet Reno the head of the Obstruction of Justice Department has done the unprecedented by classifying her own departments investigation into CIA drug trafficking the partnership for a Drug Free America is spending $2 billion of our tax money on already-proven-fruitless anti-drug ads And where do you think the money goes? Answer: to every major media corporation on the big board Gary Webb my friend you are owed a huge apology But I doubt that youll get it Not in this lifetime,shylock92008,16270105150,2

h674p5o,opbmcz,1998: CIA Says It Used Nicaraguan Rebels Accused of Drug Tie; By James Risen July 17 1998 ; "The agencys decision to keep those paid agents or to continue dealing with them in some less formal relationship was made by top officials at headquarters in Langley Va" - NYT  https://wwwnytimescom/1998/07/17/world/cia-says-it-used-nicaraguan-rebels-accused-of-drug-tiehtml CIA Says It Used Nicaraguan Rebels Accused of Drug Tie By James Risen July 17 1998 The Central Intelligence Agency continued to work with about two dozen Nicaraguan rebels and their supporters during the 1980s despite allegations that they were trafficking in drugs according to a classified study by the CIA The new study has found that the agencys decision to keep those paid agents or to continue dealing with them in some less formal relationship was made by top officials at headquarters in Langley Va in the midst of the war waged by the CIA-backed contras against Nicaraguas leftist Sandinista Government The new report by the CIAs inspector general criticizes agency officials actions at the time for the inconsistent and sometimes sloppy manner in which they investigated -- or chose not to investigate -- the allegations which were never substantiated by the agency The inspector generals report which has not yet been publicly released also concludes that there is no evidence that any CIA officials were involved in drug trafficking with contra figures The fundamental finding of the report is that there is no information that the CIA or CIA employees ever conspired with any contra organizations or individuals involved with the contras for purposes of drug trafficking a United States intelligence official said The new report is the long-delayed second volume of the CIAs internal investigation into possible connections between the contras and Central American drug traffickers The investigation was originally prompted by a 1996 series in The San Jose Mercury-News which asserted that a dark alliance between the CIA the contras and drug traffickers had helped finance the contra war with profits from drug smuggling The second volume dismisses those specific charges as did the first volume released in January The series charged that the alliance created a drug trafficking network that introduced crack cocaine into South Central Los Angeles It prompted an enormous outcry especially among blacks many of whom said they saw it as confirmation of a Government-backed conspiracy to keep blacks dependent and impoverished The Mercury-News subsequently admitted that the series was flawed and reassigned the reporter In the declassified version of the CIAs first volume the agency said the Mercury-News charges were baseless and mentioned drug dealers who had nothing to do with the CIA But John M Deutch the Director of Central Intelligence at the time had also asked the inspector general to conduct a broader inquiry to answer unresolved questions about the contra program and drug trafficking that had not been raised by The Mercury-News Frederick Hitz then the CIAs inspector general decided to issue a second larger report to deal with those broader issues Many allegations in the second volume track closely with charges that first surfaced in a 1987 Senate investigation The CIA is reluctant to release the complete 500-page second volume because it deals directly with contras the agency did work with According to the report CIA officials involved in the contra program were so focused on the fight against the Sandinistas that they gave relatively low priority to collecting information about the possible drug involvement of contra rebels The report concluded that CIA officers did report on drug trafficking by the contras but that there were no clear guidelines given to field officers about how intensively they should investigate or act upon the allegations In all the CIA received allegations of drug involvement against about 50 contras or supporters during the war against the Sandinistas the report said Some of the allegations may have been specious the result of Sandinista propaganda American intelligence officials said It could not be determined from the CIAs records how many of the 50 cases were fully investigated But the agency continued to work with about two dozen of the 50 contras according to American intelligence officials familiar with the report They said the report had found that the agency was unable to either prove or disprove the charges or did not investigate them adequately American intelligence officials who provided information about the report declined to identify the individual contras who were the subjects of the drug allegations But they did say that in addition to individual cases the report found that drug allegations had been made against one contra organization a group known as 15th of September That group was formed in 1980 and was disbanded in January 1982 The CIAs decision to classify this second volume has already been met with criticism in Congress Senator John Kerry Democrat of Massachusetts who led a 1987 Congressional inquiry into allegations of contra drug connections wrote a letter Thursday to the Director of Central Intelligence George J Tenet asking that the report be immediately declassified Mr Kerry who has reviewed the second volume of the inspector generals report said he believed that CIA officials involved in the contra program did not make a serious effort to fully investigate the allegations of drug involvement by the contras Some of us in Congress at the time in 1985 1986 were calling for a serious investigation of the charges and CIA officials did not join in that effort Mr Kerry said There was a significant amount of stonewalling Im afraid that what I read in the report documents the degree to which there was a lack of interest in making sure the laws were being upheld A version of this article appears in print on July 17 1998 Section A Page 2 of the National edition

h67hc60,opbmcz,[https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/](https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/) CIA ADMITS TO DEAL WITH JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO OBSTRUCT JUSTICE Michael Levine & Laura Kavanau-Levine THE EXPERT WITNESS radio show March 24 1998 As an ex DEA agent I found the complete lack of coverage by mainstream media of what I saw last night during the congressional hearings into CIA Drug Trafficking on CNN both depressing and frightening I sat gape-mouthed as I heard the CIA Inspector General testify that there has existed a secret agreement between CIA and the Justice Department wherein "during the years 1982 to 1995 CIA did not have to report the drug trafficking its assets did to the Justice Department" (This is the agreement by the way that lead directly to events described in our non-fiction books The Big White Lie and Deep Cover Those many who have read the books will know instantly what I am talking about) To a trained DEA agent this literally means that the CIA had been granted a license to obstruct justice in our so-called war on drugs; a license that lasted-so CIA claims-from 1982 to 1995 a time during which Americans paid almost $150 billion in taxes to "fight" drugs Of course the evidence indicates that they did not stop obstructing justice in 1995 either but that I suppose is going to be another congressional hearing As far as the current hearings go this Catch 22 "revelation" means that all the present hearings are for nothing; that-if they are caught violating the drug laws-they had been given "secret" license to do so by our Justice Department This might also explain Janet Renos recent and unprecedented move in blocking the release of a Justice Department investigation into CIA drug trafficking God with friends like these who needs enemies? I t is now clear that this agreement began with the events described in THE BIG WHITE LIE; that the top drug traffickers in Bolivia then supplying virtually all the worlds cocaine-including Sonia Atala-were CIA assets that had to be protected from our deep cover probe Laura and I still have the proof of this that we used to back up the publication THE BIG WHITE LIE The same proof was later incorporated into other data backing up the publications of DEEP COVER and TRIANGLE OF DEATH [https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/](https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/) Our evidence-which congress has been craning its neck not to see- for instance shows clearly that during Operation Hun (the story in The Big White Lie) secret meetings were held with CIA and Justice Department wherein all indictments of top government officials in Bolivia were blocked We now believe this agreement began because of Operation Hun CIA had to hide the fact that they were supporting the people manufacturing virtually all the cocaine being produced in the world at that time In Deep Cover we showed that during Operation Trifecta-a highly successful deep cover probe into the top of the drug world in three countries (Panama Bolivia and Mexico) -Attorney General of the US Ed Meese found it necessary to warn the Attorney General of Mexico about DEAs case We (undercover DEA agents and Customs agents) found links between top US government officials and the people who murdered DEA agent Kiki Camarena that to this day go unexamined by our congress or anyone else In "TRIANGLE OF DEATH a work of "faction" we showed CIAs real-life involvement in the protection and creation of one of the most murderous criminal organizations to ever plague America an organization created by escaped Nazi fugitives under CIA protection-events occurring long before this alleged CIA Justice agreement And so the dance continues If anyone watched the CNN show you cannot have helped but notice the snickering on the part of Congressional chairman Porter Goss (an ex CIA officer) as congresswoman Maxine Waters spoke Now heres the reason why: Sources of mine who speak to me from inside this veil of secrecy out of conscience and because I am cheaper and more reliable than a psychiatrist have already told me the following: There is secret communication between CIA and members of the Congressional staff-one must keep in mind that Porter Goss the chairman is an ex CIA official- indicating that the whole hearing is just a smoke and mirror show so that the American people-particularly the Black community- can "blow off some steam" without doing any damage to CIA The CIA has been assured that nothing real will be done other than some embarrassing questions being asked That the hearings will result in the CIA receiving even a larger budget than the current $26 billion that they admit to One of the most distressing things for me a 25 year veteran of this business to listen to was when Congresswoman Waters said that the hearings were not about CIA officers being indicted and going to jail "That is not going to happen" she said Almost in the same breath she spoke of a recent case in Miami wherein a Venezuelan National Guard general was caught by Customs agents smuggling more than a ton of cocaine into the US Despite named CIA officers being involved in the plot as Congresswoman Waters stated the Justice Department will not tell her anything about the case because of "secrecy laws" No wonder chairman Goss was snickering She could not have played more neatly into CIA hands than to surrender before the battle was engaged For the entire existence of CIA they have gotten away with doing more damage to the American people than all our traditional enemies combined precisely because no one was ever prosecuted From the CIA protection of Nazi criminals from war crimes prosecution as they set up criminal organizations that preyed on America (Triangle of Death) to their lies to President Kennedy that dragged us into Bay of Pigs to their lies to President Johnson that dragged us into the Vietnam War to their creation of a pan Arab army of American hating drug trafficking terrorists during the Afghan War to the Church Commission hearings to MK-Ultra to the Bolivian Cocaine Coup ("The Big White Lie") to their protection of the worlds top cocaine traffickers as they laid waste to American streets (Deep cover) the CIA has acted exactly as Senator Frank Church once described them: "a runaway rogue elephantcompletely unresponsive to Congressthey (the CIA) have not only been unproductive they have been contra productive they have brought great shame on America" And the dance continues &#x200B; &#x200B; https://npredditcom/r/NarcoFootage/comments/nthcsy/dea6\_by\_dea\_hector\_berrellez\_wayne\_schmidt\_opr/ The KIKI Camarena murder was tied to the use of US intelligence using drug cartel ranches for Contra military training AND Contra/DOD/NSC/Oliver North drug smuggling ring at the same time MEREX Corp supplied arms and other items to the cartel/ It was owned by a Ex Nazi CIA agent named Gerhard Mertins the company also employed Klaus Barbie,shylock92008,16270103370,1

hw3jwr9,snj9i6,Careful not to over analyze analogies guys doing so completely misses the purpose of an analogy as an argumentative technique I mentioned this in some comments below but wanted to throw this out there because there seems to be some misunderstandings Analogies are NOT meant to be 1 to 1 comparisons; they are a form of comparison to shed light on a specific aspect of an argument in a different light Attacking an analogy without the context of how they are being used on specifics that arent relevant to the comparison doesnt defeat the analogy it just misses the point being conveyed in the first place The seatbelt analogy is not saying car safety and corona safety are the same thing The analogy is a response to arguments along the lines of "why do I need a mask if Im already vaxxed?" If you ignore this context and just attack the details of why seatbelts arent like masks/vaccines you have missed the point and are instead arguing against a point no one made A better argument would be something like a better analogy or an explanation as to why the analogy doesnt work For example: "seatbelts and airbags are great for a collision but not very helpful when your car gets rammed not lake Omicron" This is an actual argument against the analogy because it conveys the normalcy of overlapping safety measures the original analogy was pointing out is irrelevant when the safety measures are designed to protect against a different harm than what has occurred Dont lost in the weeds like OP about random stuff like how seatbelts dont cause long term health effects (an argument literally no one made thats irrelevant to efficacy of overlapping safety measures aka the point of the analogy) Instead focus on actually refuting point the analogy was making in the first place If you want to successfully attack an analogy you have to stick to the topic actually being analogized Otherwise youre totally missing the point and refuting the wrong argument,Popular_Ad4115,16443374590,1

hw497h0,snj9i6,You seem misinformed on the vaccine in general The reason comparing a seatbelt to the vaccine is an analogy is because its similar in some ways but the two are not exactly same And you must remember the context the seatbelt analogy is often brought up as an answer to "why do I need to wear a mask if I already have a vaccine" the answer of course being that we wear seatbelts as well as airbags because we want to improve our chances of not only not passing it on but also not dying You also seem to think that the risk of blood clots in the vaccine are bad would it surprise you to know that the coronavirus as a much much (x10) higher chance of blood clots "necrological disorders" and all manor of other side effects? You also seem to think theyre are some secret "long term results" were still waiting for but this is a strange thought No vaccine before has ever been present in the body for more than 6 months at the absolute most Vaccines as you know are there to train the immune system and dont stay in the body long usually around a month or less With 2 billion+ doses administered we still have no addition side effects so it seems strange to wait for these Covid on the other hand seems very capable of permanently damaging a lot of lung ear nose and throat systems with long term effects like difficult breathing lung capacity smell and taste and many more just being permanently changed Im not sure what "hiding the safety data" the cdc and all the drug agencies have been very forthcoming on all their trials You all even got mad at the cdc for saying there was no evidence of airborne contagion early on and then changing that stance after they researched it and got evidence Same thing with when they said dont wear masks at first as they were no thought at the time to be necessary but new data came out and the cdc adapted its message to the studies The cdc has been reflective of the data from the begining You might be talking about the preprint studies and the VAERS database stuff Those Im sure you have heard are flawed for many reasons their results may be correct or not but we need more data before we can say anything If the researchers and doctors at the head of the preprints or VAERS claims believed that they would want to wait for these studies But we did this cycle with monocoidal antibodies ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine and each time they put in the work for a big double blind study these drugs are reveal to do nothing or so little as to be nothing You also seem very concerned about the companies themselves but for all your conspiracy you dont look at the positives These companies are looking to make big money from government contracts and to get the biggest ones you need an effective vaccine as verified by the FDA and the 40 other countries the vaccine will go too including France Britain Germany and even our enemies China and Russia It in their best interest to make a working vaccine especially because they must compete in a hot market theyre now like 7 different vaccines from different companies so competition is fierce I mean just ask yourself if the vaccine was truly dangerous why wouldnt Russia or China talk about it Or the hundreds of journalists looking for hot stories or any of our allied countries to alter their friends or peoples or the competing companies after their government contract All these people and more would have to work together its impossible,rascalrhett1,16443466010,-4
hw378p6,snj9i6,This is completely missing the primary point of when most people are bringing up the seatbelt analogy Yes some people bring it up as a pure example of a mandated safety rule But the primary point of the seatbelt analogy is in explaining to people how a vaccine can be working but that the majority of people in some places who are hospitalized are vaccinated Thats because the ratios matter The analogy then is to how seatbelts work to reduce risk in crashes but far more people end up in hospitals from car crashes who were wearing seatbelts than who werent because almost everyone wears a seatbelt The only other context the seatbelts are sometimes used is analogous to masks and then the analogy works pretty well even in the use-case So this primarily seems to be an argument being directed at what is fundamentally a misunderstanding of the main reason seatbelts get mentioned,JoshuaZ1,16443325170,-7

hrd6x4k,rwkj3w,My aunts and I had such a great time in DC in 2019 as it was our first time visiting and we liked it so much that we said we would go back this year Cue a few weeks ago the DC mayor implemented that damn vaccine mandate where you have two have two doses of it in order to enter indoor venues This completely shit on my trip and I either have to get fully vaccinated before March 8th since my trip is at the end of that month or not go There is the option of going but not going anywhere indoors but then Id be the odd woman out This shit is STUPID!

hrfghyd,rwkj3w,The worst is yet to come My religion (Orthodox) had prophecies about this and so far around 8-9 of them came true (theres more but they are some smaller ones so I wouldnt mention them) The one that is yet to come true is the one saying "once the humanity is at the point of not knowing what to do as times are getting worse and no solutions are to be found antichrist will appear with a solution" (I tried to translate it as best as I could) Vaccines are proving as failing which is exactly what they want The time will come when they will say publicly that they no longer know what to do and how to deal with the pandemic Thats when a *certain person* will appear with a "solution" to end all problems and he will be throned in UN as the humanitys saviour I made this as brief as I could as it is rather complex and in order to truly understand and believe all this youd need to know a lot of backstory Another huge one said that "there will be a global pandemic before the end" (This one was told about 200-300 years ago iirc) We live in the end times sadly You may or may not believe me but Ive been following advices that my religion told me due to these prophecies and I havent regretted a single decision I made thus far Ive simply been following prophecies and what they tell us to do and Im making it work Havent and wont take the vax as I know what it is leading towards,HRCK0,16414291920,2

Now 1 month later they send her another threat and it is obvious that they didnt even READ her justification and are now only accepting an excuse directly from a doctor! They are also ONLY listing allergies to the vaccine as a medical excuse I know she is scared to death Ive heard her balling her eyes out asking her superiors at the company to speak up for her and advocate They are all too afraid to be viewed as "antivaxxer" themselves and have done nothing to help her so far Dont want to piss off daddy tech These superiors also had NO IDEA that this mandate was even in place at the company They knew nothing about these threats being sent to unvaccinated workers She is the top performer in her team This is the best job she has ever had by far and she is scared to death of losing it To the point where she is now thinking of getting the vaccine even though she knows it is highly risky for her health in particular! She has done everything right to justify not getting the vaccine and they are completely ignoring her! If anyone in the US knows of any recourse we could take against this measure please tell me! I know that this is illegal and the courts will MAYBE eventually side with basic fucking ethics but she cant wait for that At the end of this month she will be vaccinated or unemployed all so she can continue working from home around nobody else Again if anyone has advice please give itand keep in mind the company is stonewalling her and not even answering her questions,billyjk93,16414124040,1

hmje0na,r4vfd2,**OP is wrong** All of the fault for what happened the night Epstein died and what happened to the video belongs to the Metropolitan Correctional Center which is managed by the Bureau of Prisons The prosecutors in the Southern District of New York do not have any supervision over the jail https://lawandcrimecom/awkward/government-reverses-course-jeffrey-epstein-suicide-attempt-video-no-longer-exists/ > The Government respectfully submits this letter to provide a further update to the Court regarding the defenses request for video footage from outside the defendants cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC") on July 22  July 23 2019 On or about December 19 2019 the Government informed the Court and defense counsel that it had confirmed with MCC staff that the requested video had been preserved and that the Government was working to obtain a copy from MCC As set forth in greater detail below the Government has learned that the MCC inadvertently preserved video from the wrong tier within the MCC and as a result video from outside the defendants cell on July 22  23 2019 (ie the requested video) no longer exists > On or about July 23 2019 at approximately 1:27 am MCC corrections officers responded to the cell ("Cell-1") that the defendant shared with Jeffrey Epstein On or about July 25 2019 defense counsel requested that MCC preserve video footage from outside the defendants cell from July 22 2019 at 11:00 pm through July 23 2019 at 4:00 am From speaking with MCC legal counsel the Government understands that in response to this request MCC legal counsel looked up the defendants cell number in the MCC computer system and thereafter requested that MCC staff preserve video from outside of that cell for the requested time period An MCC staff member confirmed that the video had been preserved > On or about January 3 2020 the MCC provided the Government with a copy of the video that it had preserved which the Government then converted into a playable format After reviewing the video it appeared to the Government that the footage contained on the preserved video was for the correct date and time but captured a different tier than the one where Cell-1 was located because the preserved video did not show corrections officers responding to any of the cells seen on the video After speaking with MCC legal counsel the Government was informed that the MCC computer system listed a different incorrect cell for Tartaglione ("Cell-2") Therefore when MCC legal counsel asked that the video outside of the defendants cell be preserved the MCC preserved video outside of Cell-2 instead of Cell-1 > The Government understands from speaking with MCC legal counsel that there was a backup system in place that housed all video for the Special Housing Unit including the video requested by defense counsel The Government further understands from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that it has reviewed that backup system as part of an unrelated investigation and determined that the requested video no longer exists on the backup system and has not since at least August 2019 as a result of technical errors >The Government will make the video of the tier containing Cell-2 available for defense counsels review at the United States Attorneys Office There is no suggestion that the prosecutors did anything wrong,ShaniquaSoros,16381987480,155

hcg5xo6,pm5sqs,This is exactly how Americans and the US government reacted when they knew what was happening in Europe during WWII They ignored the cries for help from Jews and others being persecuted by the Third Reich National Geographic published a story about the Nazi concentration camps and US companies were involved in the atrocities committed in those camps and the US government knew exactly what was happening inside those concentration camps Many people knew about the death camps and they didnt care How can anyone trust a government that knew about the Holocaust but refused to intervene? Or the corporations that participated in the horrors of the Holocaust that are still thriving today? Its shameful The US knew about the atrocities being committed by the Nazis: https://dislibusfedu/scalar/fhm/us-response Also a bunch of huge American companies actively aided and collaborated with the Nazis all of which are still thriving today: https://allthatsinterestingcom/major-brands-nazi-collaborators/7 https://11pointscom/11-companies-surprisingly-collaborated-nazis/ https://wwwtoptenznet/top-10-american-companies-that-aided-the-nazisphp https://wwwphactualcom/8-american-companies-that-worked-with-the-nazis-during-world-war-ii/ Ford and General Motors involvement with the Third Reich: https://wwwcorpwatchorg/article/ford-nazi-war-efforts https://wwwjewishvirtuallibraryorg/https://wwwjewishvirtuallibraryorg/general-motors-and-the-third-reichgeneral-motors-and-the-third-reich Pharmaceutical industry and their involvement in the Holocaust: https://wwwwarhistoryonlinecom/war-articles/popular-pharmaceutical-company-bayer-bought-concentration-camp-victims-wwiihtml https://jonahintheheartofninevehblogspotcom/2017/12/nazi-medical-experiments-andhtml?m=1,PorcelainPoppy,16313765350,1
