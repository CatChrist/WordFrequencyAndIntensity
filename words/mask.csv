hw3jwr9,snj9i6,Careful not to over analyze analogies guys doing so completely misses the purpose of an analogy as an argumentative technique I mentioned this in some comments below but wanted to throw this out there because there seems to be some misunderstandings Analogies are NOT meant to be 1 to 1 comparisons; they are a form of comparison to shed light on a specific aspect of an argument in a different light Attacking an analogy without the context of how they are being used on specifics that arent relevant to the comparison doesnt defeat the analogy it just misses the point being conveyed in the first place The seatbelt analogy is not saying car safety and corona safety are the same thing The analogy is a response to arguments along the lines of "why do I need a mask if Im already vaxxed?" If you ignore this context and just attack the details of why seatbelts arent like masks/vaccines you have missed the point and are instead arguing against a point no one made A better argument would be something like a better analogy or an explanation as to why the analogy doesnt work For example: "seatbelts and airbags are great for a collision but not very helpful when your car gets rammed not lake Omicron" This is an actual argument against the analogy because it conveys the normalcy of overlapping safety measures the original analogy was pointing out is irrelevant when the safety measures are designed to protect against a different harm than what has occurred Dont lost in the weeds like OP about random stuff like how seatbelts dont cause long term health effects (an argument literally no one made thats irrelevant to efficacy of overlapping safety measures aka the point of the analogy) Instead focus on actually refuting point the analogy was making in the first place If you want to successfully attack an analogy you have to stick to the topic actually being analogized Otherwise youre totally missing the point and refuting the wrong argument,Popular_Ad4115,16443374590,1

hw497h0,snj9i6,You seem misinformed on the vaccine in general The reason comparing a seatbelt to the vaccine is an analogy is because its similar in some ways but the two are not exactly same And you must remember the context the seatbelt analogy is often brought up as an answer to "why do I need to wear a mask if I already have a vaccine" the answer of course being that we wear seatbelts as well as airbags because we want to improve our chances of not only not passing it on but also not dying You also seem to think that the risk of blood clots in the vaccine are bad would it surprise you to know that the coronavirus as a much much (x10) higher chance of blood clots "necrological disorders" and all manor of other side effects? You also seem to think theyre are some secret "long term results" were still waiting for but this is a strange thought No vaccine before has ever been present in the body for more than 6 months at the absolute most Vaccines as you know are there to train the immune system and dont stay in the body long usually around a month or less With 2 billion+ doses administered we still have no addition side effects so it seems strange to wait for these Covid on the other hand seems very capable of permanently damaging a lot of lung ear nose and throat systems with long term effects like difficult breathing lung capacity smell and taste and many more just being permanently changed Im not sure what "hiding the safety data" the cdc and all the drug agencies have been very forthcoming on all their trials You all even got mad at the cdc for saying there was no evidence of airborne contagion early on and then changing that stance after they researched it and got evidence Same thing with when they said dont wear masks at first as they were no thought at the time to be necessary but new data came out and the cdc adapted its message to the studies The cdc has been reflective of the data from the begining You might be talking about the preprint studies and the VAERS database stuff Those Im sure you have heard are flawed for many reasons their results may be correct or not but we need more data before we can say anything If the researchers and doctors at the head of the preprints or VAERS claims believed that they would want to wait for these studies But we did this cycle with monocoidal antibodies ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine and each time they put in the work for a big double blind study these drugs are reveal to do nothing or so little as to be nothing You also seem very concerned about the companies themselves but for all your conspiracy you dont look at the positives These companies are looking to make big money from government contracts and to get the biggest ones you need an effective vaccine as verified by the FDA and the 40 other countries the vaccine will go too including France Britain Germany and even our enemies China and Russia It in their best interest to make a working vaccine especially because they must compete in a hot market theyre now like 7 different vaccines from different companies so competition is fierce I mean just ask yourself if the vaccine was truly dangerous why wouldnt Russia or China talk about it Or the hundreds of journalists looking for hot stories or any of our allied countries to alter their friends or peoples or the competing companies after their government contract All these people and more would have to work together its impossible,rascalrhett1,16443466010,-4
hw378p6,snj9i6,This is completely missing the primary point of when most people are bringing up the seatbelt analogy Yes some people bring it up as a pure example of a mandated safety rule But the primary point of the seatbelt analogy is in explaining to people how a vaccine can be working but that the majority of people in some places who are hospitalized are vaccinated Thats because the ratios matter The analogy then is to how seatbelts work to reduce risk in crashes but far more people end up in hospitals from car crashes who were wearing seatbelts than who werent because almost everyone wears a seatbelt The only other context the seatbelts are sometimes used is analogous to masks and then the analogy works pretty well even in the use-case So this primarily seems to be an argument being directed at what is fundamentally a misunderstanding of the main reason seatbelts get mentioned,JoshuaZ1,16443325170,-7

h7brc7u,ovpxdj,I hate that I feel this way but I am torn about masking up again in public and at work - not because I dont like wearing a mask I actually dont mind it and often forgot I had it on What I am dreading is the confrontations the anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers who will sneer and mock and the conversations with clients and coworkers who think its all a hoax The thing is the mask worn by me is for them its to protect them and their families who cant/wont get the damn shots Im torn because I dont want to unknowingly pass anything along that might sicken hospitalize and maybe kill someone who cannot get the shots but Im also very close to the point where I dont give a rats ass if someone who refuses to protect themselves gets sick and dies,bookofbob,16278340250,2

h7cho06,ovpxdj,According to the research being done especially in places like Israel that has a population over 60 at 80% vaccinated by February data is showing the vaccine effectiveness is fading quick and dramatically Had you been vaccinated in January such as myself youll find youre at best walking around with an effectiveness of nearly 20% compared to someone vaccinated in June who is around 80% If unvaccinated people are the only ones getting sick the concern we are seeing wouldnt be there You would be protected with your vaccination and would have little to worry about The truth is we will see more variants and until we have boosters available and ones that can be made quickly before the new variants take hold we will continue to see spikes regardless of previous vaccinations Instead we are seeing vaccinated people spreading the virus and some knowingly I know first hand someone who is currently infected after being vaccinated in april and she continues to work at her job since the symptoms arent bad according to her and she is vaccinated The anti vaxxers are a problem but theyre a distraction from the real issue that your vaccine will only provide so much protection and its not a ticket to do whatever you want If the vaccine worked effectively for the current delta variant they would only be their own problem Kind of like driving a car with a seatbelt The direct impact is only to the individual I have and still continue to wear two masks including an n95 as well as limit my public interactions It isnt hard to wear a mask its not hard to use common sense even if youre vaccinated Weve had a hospital in my metropolitan area that had 20% of the admitted covid patients fully vaccinated It all depends on when your state started doing vaccines and how long ago it had been since you got yours And we will see a lot more of these so called "breakthrough" cases regardless of vaccination rates And government officials have been warned already of this and the CDC has discussed this internally and a lot of people are concerned about the effectiveness of the vaccines The mask mandate should have never been removed and local governments have also failed their constituents,mrnight8,16278464230,1

Masked 100% in school this fall - no option Its bullshit If you are a family that has a little one then wear your masks If I had a child under 12 my entire family would be masked right now anywhere indoors today - despite currently miniscule numbers However we dont so I dont feel its necessary to do so I wont raise a stink about masking rules that businesses want to put in place but unlike last year when I supported every single one of these mandatesthis year is different,islander1,16278483180,1

gybc19e,ndkvik,So in the facility I work in (6000+ people) we are allowing for fully vaccinated people to go without masks My company arranged for people to be vaccinated on site and before that arranged for people to get vaccinated offsite We know who the people are that did not or will not get vaccinated mainly because they wont shut up about how much of a hoax it all is This policy change came out after work on Friday Monday is going to be a shit show &#x200B; \*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\*\* TLDR: There was no shit show So Facility management sent out emails reminding people that only those that were fully vaccinated were allowed to have their masks off They also reminded people that they dont want any integrity issues by lying about being vaccinated My field requires a security clearance so a integrity issue could compromise that Walked into work today and the people who were still required to wear a mask wore one I heard minimal griping about the change in policy from the people who were unvaccinated I dont know if any minds were changed about getting the vaccine but Im appreciative that my coworkers are sticking to the mask policy,johnqpublic81,16211648840,2647

gybc0zt,ndkvik,Totally anecdotal and I realize my area might not represent the average American area since we have for the most part been taking covid seriously since the beginning but my state did announce they were changing their mask mandate to reflect the CDC guidelines so we are on the honor system now I was at the mall yesterday and it was pretty busy but literally everyone was wearing a mask still I was honestly shocked since we have good vaccine uptake and over half our adult population fully vaccinated I was expecting to see at least a few The only ones I saw were people sitting at tables and actively eating/drinking and a couple under the nose/chin but its basically no change from before the announcement I just got my 2nd shot so Im not technically fully vaxed yet but I was personally planning to still wear a mask in crowded indoor places like the mall grocery store etc for now until numbers are very low because it just doesnt bother me and its that extra bit of protection Was just surprised to see apparently everyone else feels the same way!,skatinvee,16211648790,578
gybj2i1,ndkvik,I really dont think this ending of mask rules is about trusting americans to do the right thing at all I think its assuming that the anti mask/anti vaxers WONT do the right thing forcing the vaccine hesitant to hurry up and get vaxed and then basically accelerating herd immunity among everyone who wont ever get vaxed its a risky move but at this point sigh i dont really know what else we could do other than keep waiting for something to end thats never going to,master0fcats,16211698360,673
gybqebq,ndkvik,Of course theyll lie the CDC knows that Everyone knows that Not all of us were born yesterday It sucks for those that are incapable of vaccinating but I dont know how else the CDC is supposed to proceed under the assumption that the vaccines are as effective as they are They cant force people to get shots the anti-maskers will continue to refuse shots those that cant get shots but otherwise want them cant get vaccinated and most people that want the shot are getting it They also cant expect masks to work forever just because more people get sick of them by the day Eventually people will just accept the risk like many had already been doing Really there is no way forward for the CDC with the pre-existing guidance which is why the guidance changed The belief that everyone should get vaccinated comes from the desire to eradicate COVID; that ship has sailed as early as last June and we still expect the cows to come back to the barn The cows are gone: COVID is here to stay The CDC finally threw its hands up and said "ok you want to deal with Covid? Fuck it have all the Covid you want If you want to live you know where the vaccine is" Frankly I cant blame them and would probably do the same myself I feel bad for those that cant get the Covid shot for allergies or whatever else but I dont feel bad at all if someone gets sick because they refuse to get the vaccine Now its like any other anti-vaxxor talking point,AyyyGreens,16211740740,119

gyd6qgd,ndkvik,Its too early for masks off in public indoors We should wait until 1 There has been enough time for everyone who wants the vaccine to be FULLY vaccinated including in blue areas where appointments have been less available Many age groups have only been recently eligible in some states Also dont forget people without car access need more time 2 At least 50% of the total population is FULLY vaccinated (that means a full 6 weeks after first dose) 3 Ideally until cases are down but if idiots stop us from achieving that this summer we can at least keep masks on until the only people left 12 or older and not FULLY vaccinated are TRULY just the anti-vaxxers 4 The most ideal of all would be for most people to keep wearing masks indoors in public until fall so the 2-11 age group could be included This would also crush the case numbers even more Obviously its fine for fully vaccinated people to have private unmasked indoor parties but in public a lot of lying unmasked people just means that people still waiting for their appointments and partially vaccinated people are now forced to stay at home even more than before or may be in an unsafe environment at work Because other peoples masks protect you more than your own mask And there are definitely going to be some people who stop wearing a mask just because no one else is wearing masks or because someone is harassing them for still wearing a mask,kittey257,16211982160,2

gybo0ws,ndkvik,IMO people should continue to use masks even when vaccinated because people can still get covid even when vaccinated Sure you wont get hospital but the more people without masks more it will multiply risking a new variant appear that can just ignore immunity Just search for what happened in the city of Manaus in Brazil (tldr over 70% of the city got infected with the first variant authorities thought they were safe since the majority should have antibodies P1 variant appeared and could infect even people that already caught Covid then demand for O2 skyrocketed and people died) edit: gotta love the downvotes LOL So some data for the people "buhu i dont wanna keep using a mask" [https://www1folhauolcombr/equilibrioesaude/2021/05/dois-asilos-no-rio-grande-do-sul-registram-surto-de-covid-mesmo-apos-vacinacaoshtml](https://www1folhauolcombr/equilibrioesaude/2021/05/dois-asilos-no-rio-grande-do-sul-registram-surto-de-covid-mesmo-apos-vacinacaoshtml) Basically two nursing homes in Brazil where everybody were fully vaccinated had covid outbreaks with the following results: Lar do Idoso So Vicente de Paula in So Luiz Gonzaga (RS) day 29 de abril de 2021: 79 supected cases 64 confirmed by testing (48 erderly and 16 workers 81% infection) They were vaccinated January 21 and feburary 18 10 had to be hospitalized (not in the ICU 156%) 2 died (one 77 year old man and one 80 year old woman both had debilitated health) So Vicente de Paula em So Borja (RS) (both nursing homes have similar names) Everyone vaccinated in january 20 and feb 18 first cases appeared in 23 april: 68 suspected cases 56 positive (47 elderly and 9 workers 82% infection) 10 people need hospitalized (2 in the ICU) 2 deaths (90 years old woman and a 78 year old man),7orly7,16211727550,-13

Its not like the CDC recommending/mandating masks actually caused these people to wear a mask They wouldnt wear them properly anyway when they would "comply" At this point just make sure you and everyone you care about gets the full course of the vaccine take the necessary precautions to protect yourself and others if you cant get it and F everyone else whos too stupid to not trust science,kuthedk,16211748530,1

If youre concerned about Covid get the vaccine then it doesnt matter if other people are If youre unable to get vaccinated thats unfortunate and you have to mitigate that risk as best you can but its not the rest of the worlds responsibility to mask forevermore We dont ask if people are vaccinated for ***anything*** else (any number of diseases more deadly than COVID) except to registering for school and travel There should absolutely be no circumstance in which you should have to show that you have a COVID vaccine without having to show all others (eg when youre sharing your vaccination record in circumstances where its *already* required),thekeldog,16211857120,1

gycm38v,ndkvik,The CDC is well aware that they will lie Everyone is aware of this We werent all born on the same day Its a pain for those who cant get vaccines but Im not sure how else the CDC can continue if the vaccines are as safe as they are They cant compel people to get shots; anti-maskers will continue to reject them; those who cant get shots but want them otherwise cant get them and the majority of people who want the shot are getting it They cant expect masks to work indefinitely either because more people are becoming sick of them every day People will eventually embrace the risk as many others have already done With the previous guidance the CDC had no way forward so the guidance was updated The idea that everybody should be vaccinated stems from the need to eliminate COVID; the ship sailed last June and the cows are still expected to return to the barn COVID has replaced the pigs and it is here to stay Finally the CDC threw up its hands and said "OK you want to deal with Covid?" Dont worry about it; you can have as much Covid as you want You already know where the vaccine is if you want to live" I cant say I blame them; Id probably do the same I feel bad for those that cant get the Covid shot for allergies or whatever else but I dont feel bad at all if someone gets sick because they refuse to get the vaccine Its now just like every other anti-vaccination talking point,Hot_Firefighter,16211888960,1

gycofw8,ndkvik,I think lifting the mask requirement for vaccinated individuals is the governments attempt to encourage people to get vaccinated However relying on the honesty of people is just naive The people who have thus far refused to get vaccinated have already proven to have flexible morality Lying about being fully vaccinated when they already lied about having "medical exceptions" is not too much of a stretch The vaccine isnt 100% effective and vaccinated people can still be (asymptomatic) carriers or just carry the virus externally on their clothes or person as a result of physical contact with everyday objects and people Besides you can lie to people but a virus doesnt care about your claims Are we headed for a fourth wave of infections in the US?

gycp81b,ndkvik,No the new mask rules do not put trust in people to be honest about their status The new mask rules put the onus on the unvaccinated and the unvaccinated should be terrified The immune compromised should be on high alert regardless of what the "rules" (read suggestions) say about masking Unvaccinated children are less than a blip on the radar with respect to chances of poor clinical outcomes from COVID19 What the new suggestions from the CDC do is provide impetus to vaccine hesitant people to get vaccinated,GayMakeAndModel,16211902880,1

gycpvo9,ndkvik,These days Im convinced I live on an island of sanity in a sea of lunacy I live a bit out of a small town in central Illinois Im a bit conservative most of the folks here are Boyfriends more left but its whatever From what I see online Id think our rural American town would be just a bunch of candidate jockeys whining about muh freedoms Yet just as Id suspected were all just keeping our masks on and keeping our outings short Been tough on myself given that I havent been able to leave the general area of my house since May last year thanks to the risk Im at (barring my moderna shots hell yeah) but that honestly went for a lot here Mostly older folks and kids Everyone else just keeps to the rules I just cant for the life of me see how what probably looks like a bunch of hicks farmers and meth heads behave better than what the news makes feel like the entire nation Im nearing nineteen Id thought Id have come to the whole "everyones stupid" realization by now but I look at the people around me and I see just people some down a job sparring few down a family member and just wanting things to stop being garbage So why oh why do people want to drag this mess out? I want to understand what the thought process is Im not a people person and so far I havent needed to be one Maybe I just dont have the world experience yet I got sort of thrust into adulthood a bit before the pandemic and got my bearings while it hit I just desperately want to understand why I cant bring myself to be angry at people who are so ignorant of their own situation Maybe Im just too compassionate or just dumb Im just not one to be angry like some other folks here are (rightfully so) Tl;dr for my inability to pare down the rambling the Midwest has imprinted into my European brain: Does anyone at all have any sort of insight into the anti science people?

gulj5da,mrcrm8,Im very pro-vaccines and I think this vaccine should be used but I dont get this argument People arent choosing between injecting themselves with the vaccine and injecting themselves with COVID Its not an apples to apples comparison; you have to factor in both the risk of COVID causing a blood clot *and* the risk of getting COVID in the first place In this case the risk of catching COVID would have to be more than 1/8; from what I can tell the total infection rate in the USA is only about 1/10 and for someone whos taking precautions like masking and distancing its almost certainly even less Just accept that theres a slightly elevated risk of blood clots with the vaccine but in most peoples cases the *overall* benefits (both to personal health and to reaching herd immunity so that life can go back to normal) outweigh the risk and anyone whos worried should have a conversation with their own doctor about their personal risk level,etgohomeok,16184900830,4857

The answer is yes The scientific community has spoken and weve had a general consensus about the validity and effectiveness of vaccines for decades Yes with anything medically related there are always risks involved but anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers are being completely disingenuous about those risks Millions and millions of people for decades have taken all sorts of vaccinations and lived side-effect free Vaccines have been mandatory for things like public schools for **decades** Censoring this type of bullshit content isnt an indicator that were living in this liberal dystopian future that a good amount of these anti-vaxxers seem to think were living in Its basically tantamount to removing those videos where idiots were dying from eating those detergent pods Weve 100% reached a point were we know that anti-vaccine beliefs are wrong Enabling people to continue to put out factually misleading content about vaccines is basically like promoting that drinking bleach is good for you This type of censorship whether you believe it or not is 100% for the greater good Anti-vaxxers are wrong If you believe that vaccines are some sort of liberal conspiracy perpetrated by the deep state lizard people you should be in a mental institution I ultimately feel bad for everyone who has fallen pray to bullshit conspiracy theories and are the victims of a poor public education system but now the health and wellbeing of my family and myself are at risk and its time to put an end to these dangerous beliefs Take away their ability to communicate with the masses and allow them to find some niche piece of the internet where they can be in their echo chamber in peace without risking spreading their misinformation to the rest of us,chadstark89,16329392940,-1

gy1cr9q,nbi105,I feel like a good system to make sure people who are not vaccinated to keep wearing a mask and not lie about being vaccinated is those who have been vaccinated get a code via email text or whatever and then there will be a website or app with like [insert code here] and [insert picture here] (more on that later) and when u enter the code u get a new green screen but in the background of the green screen (it would be faded) it will have a picture of you that you just inputted into the system that way it will be a lot harder for them to get away with it Also on the bottom right it can like have your code or something or a bar code they can scan to make sure its legit By "they" I mean like whenever you walk into a public building It sounds like a lot of steps but I think this will discourage people from cheating the system When like 75-80% of US adults are fully vaccinated then we can finally say fuck it and we dont need the green screen anymore,Chungulungus,16209475990,1

gy1tg8l,nbi105,I would ideally err on the side of caution and disagree with the statement by Dr Fauci because of following (I know I might get downvoted but as someone who belongs to a family of doctors including medical researchers I would like to put in my 2 cents): 1) Masks are not only supposed to prevent you from getting infected but also prevent your mucus/ nose droplets from going out when you sneeze It has been a proven fact that it is more critical for an infected person to wear a mask than a healthy person who needs protection Moreover it has been proven that fully vaccinated people can still be asymptomatic carriers of the disease So there is a chance if vaccinated people do not wear mask in public places they might end up spreading droplets and infecting people given they are asymptomatic 2) There is a potential that this will encourage a lot of non vaccinated people to stop wearing masks in public by falsely claiming they are vaccinated I am not saying that everyone will do it but even a minor section does it it might break havoc especially as some of the new variants are highly infectious 3) Look at countries who have really done well in controlling numbers eg Singapore Apart from very effecting tracing and isolation measures mandatory masks at all public places except while doing intensive exercises (ie running in a park/ or road gyms get closed the moment cases shoot up) is one of the key factors which has limited transmission in workplaces malls beaches etc Again I do not mean to undermine his statement as he is a very learner doctor but just highlight some of the possible downsides Peace,TowardsFitness,16209563140,-2

ha04grb,p9dd93,This is something I suggested to my company in the UK: Hi folks Ive given some consideration to this and would like to suggest the below rules to satisfy a flexible work offering to the SD: I have based this on: 23 SD staff (8x 24/7 engineers 15x Core shift) Image Image Image Each engineer must come in 40% of their time Each day there must be at least 5 people physically on rotad shift Each day there must be no more than 10 engineer on schedule We split the WFH days in any given week between a choice of Monday+Tuesday or Thursday+Friday This grants opportunity of "extended weekend feeling" to all Q: Why 40% submission to physical occupation? A: TeamLead stated Service Desk requires an obligatory 15% physical office presence on any working day Q: How does this impact skill availability? A: It doesnt this is based purely on resource as we have availability across core teams in the working week On average we will have 8 engineers physically within the office space Q: How this is managed? A: Either by a scheduling app/portal where engineers self-sign up (first come first serve) and commit to fulfilling their weekly hours or assigned by TLs Q: How does this solution address 24/7 flexibility? A: Whilst 24/7 day shift must attend the office space 24/7 night shift fulfil duties from home Any 24/7 day shift falling on a weekend is fulfilled from home This is open to your adjustments or leave as is in the pot for discussion and practical application for the business Thanks" Glad to say this has now been adopted  Before COVID happened my company was on target to turn 200m so they purchased a new HQ for 15m We are an IT Managed Service Provider The company had plans to go global looking for offices in the USA They signed the contract grace period passed and then COVID happened They were unable to back out of the deal and have since been working within regulations of UK lockdowns and government guidance to continue with the new head office plan We have lost only 1 employee during this pandemic and that was after he contracted Covid after major surgery Work load has increased the employment demand at our company due to demand from clients working remotely and other IT projects Due to Covid theyve put the expansion on the back burner for now and are cautiously monitoring markets and of course Covid itself They still want to expand to the US Fingers crossed!  As we have hospitals and government clients for technical support we were actually classed as support workers and got full 80% furlough offered but we didnt need to take it Covid has just sped up the work from home culture and those that do not change their ways are set to lose good employees Mental health has been cited as one of the major drivers with a large majority of workers being effected I personally have been wfh social distancing and wearing a mask in public since 2019 when my wife started chemotherapy after a mastectomy So this has been the norm for us long before Covid came along I do think there is a need for a physical space a lot of clients say the office is a place to separate home and work life Ive never had this as an issue in fact I am blessed that I have seen my son grow up since his birth in 2019 I get to spend time playing with him look after my wife and be home "on time" or work late if I want to An hour here and there longer doesnt kill me in fact I believe I start earlier and finish on time or happy to work later I think sales people need that physical connection and banter with their colleagues its the nature of that beast I know from a lot of clients and other companies I interviewed for that WFH was a massive positive to performance and output but over time people have got complacent or lazy and now efficiency is actually on the back slide WFH is definitely here to stay to what degree and capacity offered is another thing Ps feel free to use my wfh flexible working plan ,PrimarisBA,16296996010,1

hb3nkpa,pf4633,My familys all had the delta Three of four adults got Moderna P1: Coughing tiredness no hospitalization P2: Loss of taste and smell three days of moderate cold symptoms P3: slight throat tickle P4 (Pfizer): headache body aches moderate cold symptoms tiredness and loss of taste/smell no hospitalization Unvaccinated child under 12: positive but asymptotic Im convinced that having four vaccinated adults plus continued masking and distancing saved my child from the ICU Whats more Im equally convinced I would have lost at least one parent to this had both of them not gotten the shot Vaccines save lives!!,Sillycats2,16304414950,12
hb2lx5j,pf4633,Yes!! Moderna doesnt get as much press as Pfizer but they should I got Moderna at my local supermarket chain here in Florida like everyone around here did Ive been vaccinated since March Ive been near people who had covid and Ive known a few people who had it but I never got covid nor anyone I knew who had the Moderna jab Ive been on flights and some crowded restaurants Never got covid Good job Moderna! Now Ill be getting a 3rd jab in winter just to be safe Im still wearing a mask of course but overall I feel bulletproof,Typingdude3,16304259660,8

Moderna is twice as good as Pfizer! except delta is still way stronger than both with only 2 shots! &#x200B; Yes be vaxxed but please wear your masks socially distance avoid strangers right now I may hate most of you but I dont want you dead,cerebrix,16304230070,16
hb3395t,pf4633,My whole family ended up with just the Moderna option and we all thought it to be second best to Pfizer Then Delta came along and were hearing all these people who are fully vaxxed and still getting sick - sometimes very sick - with covid The thing almost all of them have in common is that they were vaxxed with Pfizer I personally have not heard of anyone sick with covid who is fully vaxxed with Moderna not to say that it doesnt happen We live in MS the state that has been called the #1 covid hotspot in the world due to our low population and prevalence of near unmitigated spread of the virus I havent seen eye-to-eye with some of my family members who are fully Moderna vaxxed as far as lack of precautions they take in public Im still really careful wearing n95 masks anytime Im indoors with the public so I feel fairly protected in most circumstances and dont feel worried about spreading an asymptomatic case but I worry about them sometimes and have been surprised our house hasnt gotten sick yet Well now I guess I know why,12stepCornelius,16304329150,5

Like We can still get it but similar to say a flu shot it isnt as likely and nowhere near as dangerous Now im being told that the delta variant makes the vaccine virtually useless so we are back to square one Im getting real tired trying to explain to the anti mask folks i live around that the vaccine is the way to go when i turn around and see that it might not work at all i have been kept away from going out and enjoying myself for almost 2 years now missed out on having a 21st birthday party and am getting real frustrated with everything Sorry for the rant but i have been playing ball this whole time and now im being told just as everything gets back to normal that we are back to square one and to return to existing by myself and continue avoiding other humans This isnt living am i crazy to rather risk my life and continue living life than stay in hiding? I know this stuff is serious and im not trying to be some psycho anti-mask anti-vax weirdo im just really frustrated that i have lost so much of my life and now im being told it was all for naught,ndelte7,16291499730,1

Hospitals are full no ICU beds Here in upstate NY we sometimes wait 3 to 4 HOURS outside the hospital with the patient in the ambulance because there are no beds in the ER And while we are waiting we cannot respond to other calls that come in People will die in this scenario from injuries or medical issues that were treatable And that makes me angry Not sure who to blame Government anti-vaxxers anti-maskers businesses that dont enforce rules the list seems endless But watching a patient die in the back of an ambulance 100 feet from the ER doors because there is no capacity to provide care is something I dont wish on anyone,IronScaggs,16413923930,8260

Come back when there is some actual data Data - even with the Delta variant - vaccinated people are hospitalized at a rate of 0003% The answer is not to make people "mask up" again - the answer is to get the idiots refusing vaccines to take the vaccine The vaccines are VERY effective The unvaccinated people are the same people who dont wear masks Mandating masks at this point would only protect the RARE case of vaccinated to unvaccinated contagion Instead of focusing on vaccinated infectiousness - focus on getting the unvaccinated to take the dang vaccine,sadpanda___,16274847280,107

h6tvlbq,ot7vtq,It says "may" because theres still no evidence that masks are necessary In fact it appears that the risk of spreading is at least lower than 20% that of unvaccinated and suggested that when you do spread it the risk to others is lower than if youre an unvaccinated super spreader shedding far more viral load All of that in the context of being around a 5-10% risk of catching it if exposed Given such evidence its quite likely that the risk of a vaccinated person spreading it and leading to hospitalizations is lower than the risk of them spreading and leading to hospitalizations for the flu I would say thats a good metric to follow in terms of whether masks are necessary Edit: this is meant to apply for the vaccinated If youre unvaccinated then wear a mask,goblue21,16274799850,26

There are only two types of people who are unvaccinated; those who cant and those who wont Those who cant have other medical issues that they need to manage and have always needed to manage and most if not all of them are at risk of dying or serious medical issues from the common cold and Im not going to wear a mask to protect them from the common cold just like before And I cant really care about people who wont get vaccinated Their choice their risk Why should I let their acceptance of that risk cause me to cater to them and protect them? If Im carrying covid while vaccinated Im going to be fine If someone comes into contact with me whos vaccinated theyre going to be fine The only other argument I can possibly see is reducing mutation chance but by that logic we should never stop wearing masks to reduce mutation chance in all other diseases too Unless vaccinations are no longer effective I dont care I protected myself if you choose not to and put yourself in risky situations that patently is not my problem You cant fix stupid,SaucyMacgyver,16274926310,1

hd2dkcd,poqczw,My moms kidneys failed last year in May They barely managed to get her a bed because of COVID patients She was on a ventilator for two weeks The nurses did they best they could to take care of her but its wasnt easy because they were swamped with COVID patients After two weeks of ventilation and dialysis they were able to get her breathing independently again (with continued dialysis) and moved from the Critical care unit They started her on physical therapy Shed developed ICU dysphoria from being kept in a medication induced coma for the duration They said it would got away after a couple of weeks It didnt It had accelerated the development of dementia The nurses tried their best to be on top of her care but they barely kept up because the hospital was packed with COVID patients trying to recover After two weeks the hospital was required to discharge her because insurance stated she was in severe risk anyone She had to transfer her to a sister hospital because a majority of skilled nursing facilities has become active COVID patients only After two weeks at the sister hospitals skilled nursing care department she had to be transferred out again because the loophole they used with her insurance to keep her the ran out They managed to find her a bed at a skilled nursing facility Within the first two weeks of being transferred there she had gone blind She was taken to optometrist and he said her blood pressure had dropped below normal so many times that she had eye strokes that had damaged her eye nerves and chases were shes never see again The nurses at all the facilities over the past eight weeks had been so busy with COVID patients that they werent able to provide the level of care on observation that would have helped maintain her blood pressure with medicine Shed struggled with high blood pressure for nearly a decade but lost her vision to low blood pressure She was in and out of the ER repeatedly during this period and was being transported to DaVita facilities for dialysis treatments three times a week Most of the skilled nursing facilities with in-house dialysis were COVID patients only and the one they managed to get her into didnt have in-house dialysis On July 22nd 2020 my mom went into cardiac arrest at a DaVita dialysis facility mid-treatment They resuscitated her and got her into an ambulance She had a second cardiac arrest on the way to hospital My mom died at 6:24am on July 23rd 2020 She spent the last month of her life in a skilled nursing facility blind surrounded by strangers barely coherent because of early onset demntia completely isolated from family and friends because of COVID-19 procedures designed to protect patients from people infected wit COVID-19 My mom went through 10 weeks of pure hell She experienced her worst nightmare Everything she told me she never wanted to live through for decades And most of it can be contributed to COVID patients flooding the hospitals She received diminished healthcare for weeks because of overpacked medical centers dealing with people who couldnt mask isolate and wash their hands My mom went into the hospital on May 1st 2020 She never came home again Ive been living completely independently for 16 months and 16 days now,damnsignins,16317914480,1

h8nk4iu,p2wk4m,Mississippian here to help put this in context: Our governor who is a die hard Trump follower has pulled back from making any mask mandates He wants people to make their own "individual choices" About two weeks ago the leading university Mississippi State University reissued a mask mandate for all classrooms and buildings Then every university followed (Ole Miss Southern etc) Usually the public schools will follow the universities but this point many public schools had already started classes Boom we started seeing outbreaks and the schools couldnt hide it COVID testing is very easy to obtain so parents with sick children started getting tested and contacting the schools Now schools have to alert all of their parents that "Weve had cases" On top of that the MHSAA (state public school athletic commission) decided to step in and announced yesterday that if "Any school goes virtual they can not play fall sports" So this will force many schools to stay face to face just to play football Meanwhile the hospitals are slammed out the ass We have ZERO ICU beds How bad is it? Tupelo Hospital (the largest rural hospital in the state) is using their Emergency Room to house patients Thats right there are people on beds in the Emergency Room waiting for a room on the floors to open up Meanwhile UMMC the states only level 1 trauma hospital (in Jackson) has started putting ER patients in a parking garage that is beside the hospital We are all waiting for a major university to just say "We are going back online for the fall" But it is rumored that wont be done until after the last day to withdraw from a college course passes (so they can make money) Translation: Its a shit show down here folks,mississippiwildman,16287760520,904

gwja6gl,n2hns4,**Michigan is now hospitalizing more people under 40 than those over 80 for COVID-19** Dr Stacey Sensor says her 18-year-old son a high school senior is "one of the healthiest people I know" "He works out every single day at five oclock in the morning" said Sensor a Gaylord physician "He takes all these supplements He only eats healthy And he got COVID at the gym "He was quite sick for about eight days" she said "So Im telling you that it doesnt matter what supplements you take what your age is Even in the healthiest individual they still can get it and they can still become very sick and then the effects can be there for quite some time" Its a cautionary tale she said for people who see COVID-19 as a serious health threat for the elderly but a much more benign illness for younger healthier people In fact Michigans current coronavirus surge has turned that assumption on its head: Last week the state was averaging more hospital admissions for COVID patients under 40 than patients age 80 or older The former was about 78 a day compared to 50 for the latter according to data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services The biggest reason for the demographic shift experts say: The difference in vaccination rates About 74% of Michigan residents age 70 and older have gotten at least one dose of vaccine and two-thirds are fully vaccinated For those 16 to 49 the numbers are 36% who have gotten one dose and 23% fully immunized; there is no vaccine authorized for children under 16 Also contributing to the surge of virus among young people is the spread of variants that are both more contagious and more lethal; the tendency of many younger adults to disregard COVID-19 guidelines and the fact that schools have reopened "Its definitely become more of a young person disease now probably because they havent been vaccinated and theyve been more likely than older folks to go out and about be in close contact with others and go to gatherings" said Dr Mark Hamed a physician who is medical director for Huron Lapeer Sanilac Tuscola Alcona Iosco Ogemaw and Oscoda counties The numbers bear that out In the first year of the pandemic Michigan residents age 60 and older accounted for 23% of cases; its now 13% Conversely those under age 20 accounted for 13% of cases during the first 12 months of the pandemic; its now 25% The chart below shows the April case numbers by age group compared to the monthly average through March 2021 as well as compared to December 2020 during the fall surge [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/WNTiwqVd1gGfPM09p2D0qzVgFZY=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/VQGMMSPTZNGADOVJQPKGAWILMQPNG) In theory thats actually a welcomed shift from the standpoint that old age is easily the biggest risk factor for being hospitalized or dying of COVID-19 But experts have been taken aback by the spike in COVID-19 hospitalizations among younger adults and children Compared to the height of the fall surge in early December Michigans average daily hospitalization admissions for COVID-19 are up 33% for those age 18 to 29 58% for thirty-somethings and 64% for those in their 40s Meanwhile hospitalizations for those age 80 and older are down 60% compared to December [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/86v1e7Apdm4-zWbHd-9Q7X4rAh0=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/RPEUG3IW5JGXTF6HQYL2RBK67Upng) "Its like you take what we were seeing before and shift it down by one or two decades" said Dr Joel Fishbain an infectious disease specialist for Beaumont Hospital in Grosse Pointe "Weve got 20-year-olds who are getting admitted and 30-year-olds requiring oxygen which we never saw before and needing as much treatment as we can give them Weve got 40- and 50-year-olds ending up on ventilators" Pediatric cases also are up Last week the state was averaging almost 10 hospital admissions a day among pediatric patients with COVID-19 triple the number in mid-February Deaths among children and younger adults have spiked too In the first 13 months of the pandemic there were six deaths among children ages 10 to 19 In the past month four deaths were reported Another 65 deaths were reported in April for 20- and 30-somethings quadruple the monthly average The chart below compares April deaths to the monthly average through March 2021 as well as to confirmed COVID deaths in December The numbers show how deaths among seniors plummeted in April compared to December as a result of vaccinations while coronavirus variants spiked deaths among unvaccinated people under age 50 [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/caQyJGE9C2BiswUM2ThU22RJumk=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/ZXCIGC7VWZCN7H65ULFSFE4GPIPNG) Deaths and hospitalizations arent the only concern While most COVID patients under age 50 "dont get severely ill there are a growing number of people who have long-haul COVID symptoms" said Dr Liam Sullivan an infectious disease specialists with Spectrum Health in Grand Rapids "They have problems with smelling with taste with concentration with memory with fatigue with night sweats "So even though they had a mild illness the first time around theyre still dealing with these things month and months later and thats not something you want to deal with when youre 25 or 35" he said "Of course you dont want to deal with it at any age but especially when youre in the prime of your life" And for women the research is growing on the dangers of COVID-19 during pregnancy Dr Kurt Wharton an Oakland County obstetrician currently has four pregnant patients in intensive care units battling COVID-19 All four are "fighting for their lives" said Wharton who works at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak While COVID-19-related deaths among pregnant women remain very rare Wharton and others say the evidence is growing that coronavirus during pregnancy can put a woman at a much higher risk of preterm birth preeclampsia and admission to the ICU and/or intubation especially if the woman has pre-existing conditions such as high blood pressure obesity diabetes or heart disease Evidence growing on COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy: Virus is dangerous; the shots are not Doctors offer several theories on why more younger people are getting significantly ill with COVID-19 in the current surge One is the spread of variants which are both more contagious and more lethal The variants are "stickier" Hamed said which means it takes less exposure to make someone severely ill or even symptomatic Wharton noted the same pattern happened during the 1918 influenza pandemic The initial surge in the spring of 1918 primarily impacted the elderly and babies But the virus mutated and came roaring back in the fall of 1918 and its primary victims during that surge were younger adults "History is repeating itself" Wharton said Another issue suggests Hamed and others: More unvaccinated people are gathering in groups without masks That increases the risk of exposure to a higher viral load which has been associated with more severe disease "The best mask you wear the less viral load you inhale" Wharton said On top that many schools have reopened and children and younger adults in particular are resuming their pre-pandemic social lives "You can see it" Wharton said "Younger people are all out in groups again walking down sidewalks shopping going to restaurants and bars together They just think theyre invulnerable" The good news is that COVID-19 vaccinations have proven "wildly successful" in significantly reducing the chances of getting the virus and spreading to others Sullivan said And just as vaccinations have blunted spread of the virus among senior citizens the spread of COVID among younger adults can be stymied through immunization shots Vaccination programs "really need to target the younger people right now" Sensor said "Theyre the ones who are getting sick Weve done a really good job of vaccinating our older population but to really move forward and get out of this pandemic we really need our younger people to step up to the plate and get the vaccine to protect themselves and protect their families",itsdr00,16198732450,154

hq60qt5,rpprbi,Honest question Why not a negative testing mandate like we do for international travel? Wouldnt that go farther to limit spread and protect the public?

hq8plst,rpprbi,This is ridiculous If they want everyone to be vaccinated to get on the planes then do away with the mask BS Im fully vaxxed and tired of these games If you dont feel its safe to travel put your mask on at home and stay out of an airplane Theres inherent risk with everything we do- you have higher chance of dying in a car crash on the way to the airport then contracting Covid while flying and subsequently dying If someone ops not to get the vaccine or wear a mask how does that affect me seeing as Im already vaccinated? News flash- it doesnt Now we know you can both pass on Covid and get Covid while vaxxed Maybe I should put knee pads on every time I walk just incase I fall First it was dont wear a mask then wear a mask then get the vaccine it will stop Covid now even if you have the vaccine youre not protected and you still need to wear a mask because you can still get Covid quarantine for 10 days now quarantine for 5 days because businesses need employees Anyone else seeing the ridiculousness here?

That might do more to curb spread It wouldnt be perfect and it wouldnt keep the angry/unreasonable/rude/crazy antivaxxers off the flights but it might still work better Theres also the issue of how the air filtration systems only work while in fought not sitting on the tarmac That seems like a real issue that needs improvement,Comprehensive-Fun47,16406399530,1

gwysdn4,n4uoij,Probably going to be downvoted for saying this but here are my reasons for being in the "unlikely" camp I want to get it the vaccine so Im curious if anyone can actually refute some of these points: Restrictions have become a moral question with easing restrictions being seen as evil and more restrictions good Seeing peoples reactions to people in this thread saying they want restrictions eased is proof of that Theres no point to getting vaccinated if well have to wear masks attend online school and have businesses shut down/otherwise crippled indefinitely The side effects and no Im not talking about the fringe cases of people dying etc I trust it enough that Im not worried about them Theres just no time in my world to feel like I got hit by an electric streetcar for upwards of a week Im a college student and accommodations made to people down for the count from the immediate side effects highly depend on the professor There will be no accommodations for me Reduced availability from the J&J freeze I had originally intended to take the J&J vaccine to minimize the effect of the previous point but after the freeze it became and continues to be incredibly difficult in my area to get Cost This is a simple one but there are likely to be negative financial repercussions for getting it ie having to pay for it Lack of a positive incentive As a college student I didnt receive any stimulus checks that went out earlier this and last year There might be a reason to get it if there was an incentive to doing so in a similar manner I would actually receive but I see no movement on that The effectiveness time per vaccine Ive heard estimates putting the time of effectiveness as low as 3-6 months depending on the variant Given all these other factors the fact that I would have to take this 4x a year in perpetuity makes this sound about as futile as it gets Those are the big ones and I dont really see any of them changing any time soon at least in my area Open to new information/having my mind changed I really do see the positives in getting it but until these roadblocks are gone it remains unlikely I will,BTSInDarkness,16201726700,4

gudhoq1,mpzwzj,The FDA/CDC has been terrible with messaging First they consistently push messaging about social distancing and mask wearing post vaccination which is nonsense Once you are fully vaccinated you can go back to your normal life To say otherwise doesnt help with vaccine confidence Now they are pausing J&J over 6 cases of blood clots After weve distributed 7 million shots 0 of which were in males who presumably cant get this shot either while paused Is there maybe a different reason why women between 18-48 got clots like say birth control for example? Doesnt the benefit of the vaccine wildly exceed the incredibly unlikely occurrence of these clots? Obviously How likely are these clots to happen in the general population? Is it 1 in a million? How many people across the world are not going to take the J&J shot now that the CDC paused it?

hsatnno,s11bxi,I live in king county WA largely democratic but the minority of people who refuse to mask up or get vaxxed account for a vast majority of hospitalizations and are also responsible for spreading this disease without any regard for human life I have lost loved ones from this disease as have so many others Hospitals are at capacity Its so frustrating to see people in the grocery store or out in public just refusing to wear a mask at this point what can be done? They have to know we are all in the middle of a global pandemic but they make a conscious decision and concerted effort to harm others and avoid any and all safety measures they refuse to follow guidelines and said guidelines are rarely enforced You ask them politely to be considerate and they swear and insult you its political to them and to everyone else its life and death Its really starting to become so sickening that the next time I see someone In safeway without a mask you can only assume they are also unvaxxed ill politely tell them to be considerate and wear a mask if they call me names or cough in my direction like others have i might just have to beat them over the head with an object I find nearby perhaps a #10 can Ive done everything I possibly can do to avoid catching or spreading this disease Im vaxxed boosted I mask up everytime I am out in public and meanwhile the people who refuse to do so are the ones responsible for covid longevity and the mutations If 100% of the population were to have masked from the beginning & if 100% of the population were vaccinated wed be a lot better off We might have been able to improve the situation for everyone but because a certain percentage of the population refuse to do anything were all worse off AntivXxers are literally the reason this virus is being allowed to mutate and spread so rapidly The only thing these people are doing by refusing to mask up is allowing the disease to spread further Life as we know it is over and I blame anti maskers and anti vaxxers and I am beyond mad Ive lost hope and I honestly dont care at this point but I want these people to know that its not going to be tolerated they cant be allowed to continue to be selfish and knowingly spread a deadly disease If we ever want things to go back to normal or even semi normal the people who refuse to do the right thing or even the bare minimum they might get the message if any time they are seen maskless in public for starters theyll be asked politely to mask up if they refuse or get confrontational they should be severely beaten this needs to be the norm Everytime they go out in public and refuse to wear a mask and refuse at the behest of others to do so they deserve serious physical injuries They do not deserve to be out in public with all the other people who have actually made an effort to reduce the spread of covid19 People who sacrificed so much and who have literally put their lives on hold to prevent this disease their sacrifices are diminished while the antimaskers behave as if nothing is wrong Their ignorance should not be allowed to continue to harm others Antivaxxers and anti maskers who arent already dead from the disease deserve to be harshly ridiculed and possibly assaulted into cooperation or worse if need be I know this may sound absurd to some of you but what other measures can be enacted?

h1rvgll,nzm2oo,I live in UT one of the states with a lower vaccination rate and a rise in infections Before when masks were still mandatory there was a significant number of people who would refuse to wear a mask or wore it like a chin daiper Businesses didnt even bother enforcing the rules despite their own signage As soon as the mask mandate was lifted not a mask in sight Sure there were still a few of us holdouts who put up with the dirty looks but in general people were too eager to discard the masks Personally the slim chance that as a fully vaccinated person I can still transmit covid is enough to inconvenience myself with a few minutes of mask wearing every day Its like firing a gun in the air its unlikely that someone will get hit by a falling bullet but its not impossible and the consequences can be devastating Because of the unvaccinated the US (and the world) will probably be dealing with this for the remainder of 2021 However at a certain point when everyone has had ample time to get vaccinated or the economy can no longer run on a deficit we may just have to take a leap of faith and let the unvacvinated reap the consequences of their choices,Reno83,16237044250,2

hrscu1f,ryzbou,Hey sounds like my school rn As of the beginnin of this semester is you test positive for covid or come into contact with someone who did youre only required to quarantine for 5 days (weekends included) and on the 6th day youre required to return to class or it counts against you (and mind you at my school if you miss 3 days youre expelled so you cant just go against their word and stay home) Doesnt matter if youre still sick Just wear your mask since theyre no longer required unless you test positive Heck theres a kid in my class who tested positive on Jan 4 and school started up again Jan 5 so he didnt come to school My teacher was gonna tell him to stay home for the time and make up his work online but the higher ups wouldnt allow it since he was asymptotic so therefore he should return to class Jan 6 and get everyone and their mom sick Its almost like the school district wants everyone to get sick and die,MrMashed,16416564980,9
hrt5iox,ryzbou,Just want to say that hospital culture for working while sick has been this way for years I was written up for calling out sick twice in a 6 month period as a new nurse both times I was legitimately sick with sinusitis and bronchitis This was pre masking so I wasnt about to come in coughing on patients and I wasnt going to wear a mask and have everyone ask me why I was wearing it (oh I am sick but I came in to work to care for you anyways) Hospitals DO NOT CARE if you are sick They will dock your pay or vacation time to force you to come in and make their ends meet It needs to change,Juan23Four5,16416679090,5

h0jsums,nrqtko,Ive worked tending bar or retail since 1991 Interact within 1 meter of hundreds of people a day for 30 years Used to catch every respiratory infection going Used to think Flu must be incredibly rare though because Ive only spent a week in bed wishing I was dead twice in those 30 years What I learnt during Covid is that there are in-fact Asymptomatics to the Flu too and people whos immune system deal with it quickly and effectively that never get uber sick with it and a flu for them ends up feeling just like a bad cold to many/most other people whereas for many/most people a Flu will floor them and send them to their beds for a week or more and make them wish they were dead Anyway havent had a single respiratory infection since about 2013 Not one!! ie No sore throats no weakness fatigue fevers chills sinus congestion blowing shit of of my nose every 10 minutes etc etc All that exposure over all those years to every single Rhino/Adeno/Corona/Flu virus going has probably rendered me immune to nearly every variant of all the common respiratory infections out there or certainly given my immune system all the tools or headstarts it needs to deal with most things out there Ive just spent 18 months serving hundreds a day with no mask but a plexiglass screen between me and the mostly mask wearing customers in my well ventilated convenience store where the permanently open door is 2m from the service counter where the register is All of the above likely did their part but in all likelihood I probably still caught Covid but was Asymptomatic thanks to all that previous respiratory infection exposure especially the cold causing corona-virii Only other explanation I can think of is my Vaping Switched to vaping in 2013 Perhaps all that Propylene Glycol coating my respiratory tract and lungs was a very effective barrier against all the endemic respiratory infections over the last 8 years and all those nicotine molecules plugged into my ACE2 receptors slowed the replication of SarsCov2 long enough for my immune system to eradicate it before I became symptomatic Sill going to get Vaccinated (Pfizer) tomorrow though!

hqripxf,rt54vc,TLDR; If youre using an antigen at-home rapid test wait until 2-3 days after symptom onset (but quarantine before then ofc) Family of 4 (50M 14F 16F 22F (myself)) We were exposed to COVID either on Christmas or the 26th (a close family friend (50Ms girlfriends son 15M with whom he was in the car with for 3+hours on the 26th) had a fever on the 26th confirmed positive PCR test on the 28th) Weve been quarantining since the 26th Day 0: 50M 16F and I took a QuickVue antigen test on the 28th They were all negative At this point 50M had a scratchy throat and was mildly coughing The rest of us had no symptoms I started getting a tickly throat (that feeling of "oh here it comes") late at night Didnt test 14F that night because the tests arent cheap :) and we were quarantining anyways At this point if one of us had it the rest of us did Day 1: The next morning 14F woke up with a fever Myself and 16F woke up with sore throats a headache fatigue and coughing 50M stayed the same I felt pretty rough that night had intense night-sweats and lots more coughing 14F broke her fever half-way through the day Day 2: 14F and 16F are feeling much better! Yay! Hardly any symptoms just mild coughing and runny nose I have worse coughing fatigue scratchy throat runny nose nausea 50M doing pretty much the same as he was--just a scratchy throat and coughing At this point its just been a bad cold for us or akin to a case of bronchitis We all took more at-home tests: 2 QuickVue 2 BinaxNOW All 4 came back positive Day 3 (today): 50M lost his sense of smell dampened sense of taste This didnt happen during his first run with COVID (April 2020) Still has similar symptoms but theyve gotten better Im doing much better still occasionally coughing & headaches/cold symptoms 14F and 16F are practically symptom-free now just a bit of coughing 14F and 16F were 2x Pfizer vaccinated in June 2021 (date of second dose) 50M was 2x Moderna vaccinated in January 2021 but caught COVID early-on from hospital work in April 2020 Was a fairly severe case lasted 15 months but no hospitalization I was vaccinated 2x Pfizer in April 2021 None of us received the booster yet I think we all caught Omicron as the symptoms are relatively mild 14F 16F and I have never had COVID before A bit sad we caught it after 2 years of not catching it 50M isnt as cautious with masking/avoiding crowded areas procedures as we are Some anecdotal evidence if you will We all tested negative the first round of testing and all tested positive the second round of testing So you may want to wait until 2-3 days after the start of symptoms before you do an at-home test Best of luck to everyone!

What are the mechanism behind it? These questions have yet to be answered and it is the job of public health officials virologists and researchers to make a determination on the risk of these effects Personally I would like to see more information on long term effects but I am leaning more towards opening up restrictions and removing vaccine mandates What are your guys thoughts?,throwaway_mysterious,16410599510,1

How are you gonna put your faith in other people when half your population either refuses to get vaccinated or buys fake vaccination certificates? How do you trust anyone?

ha7111a,pamuzn,after pumping the message of "get vaxed resume life" nonstop putting a new message like this out there which will be interpreted as: "on an individual level theres an undefined amount of additional work to be done afterwards and then maybe well see" is counterproductive imo we cant get double the vaccines in our arms to make up for the stubborn idiots we cant put twice the amount of masks on to make up for the people that dont wear them and we cant lockdown twice as hard for the idiots that partied on spring break throughout the previous peaks reward good reward and punish bad the work that still needs to be done is with local leaders hospitals setting policy companies setting policy for staff etc pivoting from "get vaccinated resume life" to "get vaccinated require vaccines for those ready to resume life resume life" seems like an easier more actionable pivot to accomplish something (besides just inspiring defeatism) than "get vaccinated hope that the dumbest lowlifes catch on eventually and maybe next year you get to live again but stay tuned" on a community level if we could require vaccines/proof of negative tests to participate in "normal" life sooner i think hammering that message would do more to incentivize individuals than when only looking at things nationally/globally good luck getting the crowd that has already done everything more or less right during quarantines mandates etc to continue paying attention while they watched a bunch of hicks bury their heads in the sand cancel out any progress and continue to stay tuned in after already sacrificing a year of life i know its complicated but seems so counterproductive not to spend time also highlighting the spots in the country that succeeded and have been able to have more normalcy already and to balance the national/international gloom and doom with the stark contrast from the cities and communities that have done it right look at floridas deaths currently surpassing the deaths of their previous peaks LONG AFTER A VACCINE HAS BEEN WIDELY AVAILABLE TO THEIR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS (eg 999% of the people that die from covid) then look at the cities that have reached 60-70%+ fully vaxed having music festivals outdoors with no burden on hospital capacity and (except for those highly at risk to begin with those in nursing homes or in healthcare or education) apart from slapping a mask on in an uber and grocery store already are back to normal it was (supposed to be) a team effort until there was a vaccine available for the most at risk which many never participated in or actively sabotaged while others did their part but now that there is a vaccine for the majority of the population and the majority of older folks have gotten it it isnt going to be a one-size-fits-all approach for each individual: qualifying for a vaccine vax rates in the individuals community co-morbidity occupation contact (or lack of contact) with at-risk or groups that cant yet get vaccinated all realistically play more of a role on how much "normal" you get to have the broader context is necessary but its an increasingly hard sell in healthy vaccinated populations to continue to buckle down seemingly endlessly when life itself is insanely short my community has done what it takes and it makes no sense to send a message to the group that has followed marching orders to now wait for the lowlifes in florida to catch up and then maybe u get your normal well be getting boosters before they get a faction of these morons vaccinated fuck em i think about all my friends that own businesses in chicago that barely stayed afloat before there was a vaccine reading this seeing this new "maybe" date (when it could instead be as simple as letting businesses set a policy to reward folks for getting vaccinated) because of some downstate/out of state hillbillies and it makes me sick,lisaleftsharklopez,16298309000,4

hp00lmw,riu275,He has always supported masking and the federal mandates that require them If you look at the whole quote it was his (very poor) attempt at saying how effective airplane filtration is not that masks werent effective in general Should he have chosen these words? There was probably a better way to say that Also for those of you who dont know airplane cabin pressure is maintained by taking outside air compressing it through the engine fan stages (before combustion) and bleeding that into pneumatic air conditioning kits (PACKs) which condition the air to the appropriate temperature and then pumping that into the pressure vessel The air is then leaked out through the outflow valves at a rate to maintain the pressurization schedule The air recirculated is quite small and does pass through the HEPA filters Air does not stagnate on an airplane and youre far more likely to get sick from the airport environment or touching surfaces than the air on the airplane at least The air on the average airliner is completely replaced every few minutes That said I still disagree with his phrasing,UnfortunateSnort12,16397934410,1736

he9a4hw,pv629v,Straight up In my area there is a fairly popular local news piece that is going around "Local bar to close down after receiving death threats in regards to vaccine passport and mask mandates" I guess its important to know my area has a vaccine passport and mask mandate The bar was a mid upscale bar Walking past quite literally the shittiest dive bar in my neighborhood last night Hole in the wall doesnt even begin to cut it because at least the hole has a plan The place has a lineup outside the door As Im walking back with my Slurpee I notice that all the boomers are lined up outside with their vaccine passports ready to go and fully masked up Then I see their sign "no mask no passport no liquor" I didnt go in so I wasnt sure how packed it was inside but it got me thinking Why the fuck are the lifer alchololics better at stoping the spread of covid than young "educated" individuals?

hnflckn,r9otza,Ive been teaching in China for 18 years and this is par for the course Ill first say Ive always worked in the private sector and there have been times that Ive been outsourced to public schools on occasion while working with a few schools in the past What a gong show Not criticizing China Just humanity in general So I came **right** after the WHO lifted the SARS travel ban to China Id planned on moving to China earlier and SARS ended up delaying my departure by a few months There are always sick kids coming to school It really broke my heart Id see kids as young as 4 years old coming to class run down and sick It just made me think "if youre going to run your kid into the ground like this at this age what kind of physical condition can you expect them to be in when theyre 30?" When H1N1 was a thing I was working 3 afternoons a week at a high school and DAMN I had classes where students were constantly going to the bathroom to puke their guts out 1/4-1/3 of the students were clearly effected I constantly encouraged them to go home but they didnt see it as an option because their teachers and parents didnt accept the practice of saying home to get better and not risk spreading their illness to others A few years later I had a kid come to school looking kinda sick and before class I asked the girls mother and she upright admitted that she was aware that her child was infected with FMD which can be extremely fatal to humans who are younger/have less developed immune systems I couldnt believe this woman I informed my co-workers of the situation We immediately locked all of the classrooms because we didnt want anyone in the other classrooms to get infected It literally took over an hour to convince the mother to take her child out of the school It was literally impossible to convince her that shed done something wrong by taking her child outside let alone to a school filled with other younglings She attempted to fight the manager when we told her that she wouldnt be able to bring her child back into the school without proof from a local hospital that her daughter was no longer contagious After the insane woman left we spent a few hours sanitizing everything in the school It must have been a weird experience for the kids and teachers in the other classrooms They normally would have finished class a long time ago and would have been let out of the classroom for breaks but they had to just hang out in the classroom while we insured that wed done our best to make sure it was safe for the kids to come out TBH we shouldnt have had anything to do with this process There should have been some division of the government to contact to have them ensure that this is done properly especially given how this disease is famous for coming through areas and taking the lives of children in waves but yeah we didnt have such a luxury at our disposal COVID wasnt nearly as bad The government had clearly learned from SARS and figured out a way to deal with it in their own way After the COVID lockdown had ended it was really nice to see so many kids come to class wearing masks I even had co-workers wearing masks when they had a cold which is something I couldnt have imagined happening ever before COVID COVID really made me question why the hell we havent been wearing masks when under the weather all of these years I think it should be a given You shouldnt be free to spread your germs when youre feeling ill just regardless of whether or not you live in a free country,ThaddCorbett,16387743750,13

hngskpl,r9otza,Stuff like this keeps happening and will continue happening It seems like there are rarely any legal repercussions for it and often these people are insulated by their culture of willful ignorance There was an outbreak in my community that landed numerous people in the hospital and directly lead to a death (that we know of) And it was all due to extreme ignorance and negligence The short version: Family did not "believe in" taking covid precautions No masks no social distancing no vaccine etc They went to a large wedding and a short while later came down with symptoms of covid But rather than get tested or isolate they went on vacation during a busy holiday weekend (if memory serves correct) At some point after they got back and only after their symptoms got worse and other people from the wedding started testing positive for covid they got tested No surprise they had covid Despite the test results the father went into to work afterwards And if all that wasnt bad enough one of the family members died They held a large funeral service with at least a hundred and likely many more people than that where covid precautions were not enforced For the sake of argument I can see why folks might give the family the benefit of the doubt in regards to going on vacation while sick but not being 100% certain its covid However going to work after getting back positive test results is malicious and/or negligent and its crazy that there are no repercussions for doing that And having a large funeral in the middle of a local outbreak is reckless and so irresponsible I dont even know how that was allowed to happen,AnnieDickledoo,16388035760,1

gyguq7k,nefjup,The data shows that vaccinated people have something like a 1 in 1 million chance of dying of COVID (not even accounting for age or co-morbidity) Personally Im not to afraid of people lying about their vaccine status as I was exposed to someone covid positive after being vaccinated and was completely fine I am convinced by the data and personal experience that the masks are redundant once youre vaccinated Plus the average person doesnt wear the damn thing right anyway If youre an adult and choose not to get the vaccine wear a mask or take precautions despite all we know now then whatever happens is on you Edit: Too**,Ov3r9O0O,16212721460,53

gyhii59,nefjup,I think it is time The mask mandates cant last forever but they needed to last at the very least until we had a vaccine available Sometime between vaccine availability and 100% vaccination rate is when the mandates go away of course Were nearing the 50% vaccination line and thats probably not a bad target Will the unvaccinated lie and not wear masks? Of course But how else do we do this? Stores had a tough time as is policing mask wearing they just cannot possibly police vaccination Overall the anti-vaccination crowd will never change their tune At this point the remaining people that should be targeted are those who want to get a vaccine but are just dragging their feet Vaccination sites are everywhere now and you dont need an appointment Its free This move gives that middle group the last bit of incentive they may need,chozar,16212820630,3

h8f0php,p1oqh4,Its no shocker to me A lot of my family and friends live in Florida Back in late June i went down to surprise my father for his 69th birthday I thought since I was fully vaccinated and cases were at their lowest since the start of the pandemic there was never going to be a better time to go I hadnt seen him in 10 years I wasnt sure I would see him again so I took the risk and drove down This trip was highly unusual Normally I would get in contact with everyone and try to spend time with as many people as I could This was more a top secret mission Ive been paying attention to everyones social media posts I knew since i had a high risk son at home there were many folks I did not want to see (He has heart failure one kidney and immuno-compromised from a cancer diagnosis as a toddler)The need to know list was minimal Even though neither of my parents are vaccinated I knew it was ok to visit my father He is living off the system and had most things delivered at his home He only left to buy cigarettes and beer and got them at a window I asked my mom to get tested because she hasnt changed her way of living since all this started Anti masker bible thumping Christian who goes to church and Costco twice a week This church sets aside a half hour after service for fellowship community dining and affection(hugging and spreading love) I visited a handful of friends One group knew i was coming down before anyone else They all were fully vaccinated and quarantined themselves before I arrived Chatting with them made me realize that most Floridians just dont care about following the rules Its always been business as usual down there Theres been major events like concerts live DJ performances and parties weekly Ive seen tons of posts from packed venues Nobody wearing masks all crammed tightly in a building One night I visited my best friend since high school We got to chat while smoking a fat bowl (she bought a new piece just for me for my visit) and she said it perfectly "Florida just dont give a fuck about Covid" Its that frame of mind why Florida will be hit mega hard by this variant Theres a huge number of unvaccinated people down there You have the younger crowd partying like its 1999 mixing with a massive older retired population A recipe for disaster Even with this new variant and numbers skyrocketing they still just dont care With Summer coming to a close soon all of the snowbirds will start arriving again Just in time as the Delta is getting in gear I probably shouldnt have taken the drive down or seen as many people as I did But like I said cases were at their lowest and most of the small number of people I visited were vaccinated I caught a lot of flak once everyone found out I was down and never stopped in Those that knew I was coming also knew the situation with my son and took precaution Most of the time spent together was outdoors and distanced at a persons home The only home I went in was my Fathers I knew it was only a matter of time before a new variant swept through the Sunshine State Im glad I went when I did My dad is a chain smoker and ex hardcore drug addict I never once seen him eat when i was there Beer and cigarettes thats it Didnt matter if it was 8 in the morning or midnight Alcohol and nicotine If you heard him cough you would know he doesnt have much time left on Earth I had to go down to see him when the opportunity was there,ac1dre1gn77,16286075150,97

h8fv8hj,p1oqh4,There are two factors at play here: * Floridas state ban on school mask mandates * Increased Transmission from Delta There have been some [pretty robust](https://wwwnytimescom/2021/08/10/opinion/covid-schools-maskshtml) [studies](https://abcsciencecollaborativeorg/report-shows-that-n-c-k-12-schools-reopened-safely-paving-the-way-for-schools-nationwide-to-limit-covid-19-spread-in-the-classroom/) that show that at least for last years variants in-person education had very low transmission rates so long as everyone was wearing masks So the question is how much of this transmission is due to students not masking and how much is due to the increased transmission rate of the Delta variant? As the parent of kids who are in a school district thats headed back to in-person-with-masks-required school in a few weeks my hope is that masks are still effective enough to allow for safe in-person learning until under-12s can get vaccinated But we really dont know that yet If my kids were headed back to school tomorrow with the data we have available today in an environment where masks are required Id likely send them with N95 masks But well see what things look like in a few weeks when I have to make that decision for realsies,AtOurGates,16286203390,3

Dunno not a doctor Ive had the flu before but this was something else SO got the shot its a matter of time before i need to but Im scared to death of the side effects Not trying to come off as antivax just anxiety I wear my mask everywhere edit: Sooooooo I did the thing for the greater good and took the shot Definitely teetered on the edge of anxiety and panic as I hate needles Had a staph/blood infection in my finger a long time ago and they inserted the needle from the tip of my finger downward about 1/4in so that was the most intense pain didnt feel anything on this covid shot but now im waiting for crappy symptoms,exccord,16184563220,2

hy5ve2h,szo1gx,I would say that 1) all of us have suffered through the pandemic in our own way but most of us havent lost someone close so 1M doesnt really hit home 2) most people seem to want to "return to normal" because science and medicine appear to not completely understand the virus and dont have any more answers What are we supposed to do?

hy64xwv,szo1gx,Its definitely not normal its a (hopefully) once in a century tragedy! The question is what else can we do? We locked down and started masking in hopes we drove the virus to extinction That didnt work so we kept that up until we had a vaccine available By this point there is a safe effective vaccine that everyone besides small children can get and theyll hopefully be able to get it in the coming months We even have antivirals to combat the virus Whats the goal now? Lockdowns and masks arent going to stop the virus just buy us time by slowing it down And now we no longer know what were buying time for The flu pandemic never really ended we just stopped treating it as exceptional; covid will be the same as hard as that is to accept,yozaner1324,16456605180,5
hy7g5tb,szo1gx,I dont know what to tell internet people except that for a lot of us COVID changed nearly nothing The jobs didnt let us go home the bills kept coming no checks came in the mail except for those two that everyone mocked for being silly and not even covering one month of rent Unless we wanted to quit and stay home (no unemployment checks for quitters in the US) there was no real choice except to carry on mask up and go to work Its been same crap different day since March 2020 Sometimes you hear about somebodys granny passing away or your coworker goes home with COVID for two weeks while you pick up the slack and then they come back and thats the end of it Theres been a huge mismatch between the online wailing about COVID and the actual experience of living with it and when I say living with it I mean week in and week out in one of the industries where we had higher COVID death rates than the medical people did Line cooks dont take masking very seriously Too high probably think 5G is the virus MOST of the US has been in this boat the entire time The poor Amazon workers didnt get a single day off they got overtime Only on the internet do people seem to live in this weird parallel universe defined by work from home and perpetual COVID measures Its been a hell of a thing to watch people act like thats normal It doesnt matter what I think of any of it I didnt even get to stay home from work for a week while I watched the whole world slam the shutters at once thats how much power I have Call me all the names you want Tell me Im stupid or whatever I have no control over your situation Outside of your bubble its been "normal" this entire time Its been two solid years of everyone carrying on more or less as usual The virus has somehow avoided presenting a face to the public that would make them treat it like a mortal threat the way things like Ebola did and the bosses arent letting anyone off the hook since they can all stay home safe if they wanna Youre the educated middle class not me Youre the ones who should have come up with some sort of way to force whatever it is youre wanting on the world Perpetual work from home? I dont know what you want You had the money resources safety and time to do something about it politically All I know is that everyone has been living in "normal" for a quarter of a decade except for you deaths or no deaths It seems that all your kind can really muster is thinkpieces like this one that tell everyone what they already know and that will fail to convince anyone who doesnt want to know Its just ineffective handwringing except for maybe this writer made a buck from it Maybe Mourn if you want to but theyre obviously going to drag you all back into the offices by your scruffs that or fire you Again its been "normal" since like June 2020 and it looks like its finally your turn at that shit sandwich Whatever the hell this is thats normal now,AttackPug,16456826160,6
hy5y5ch,szo1gx,The problem with this article is the tone it takes and how it tries to use shame to purport its thesis The reality is that the people who need to care a little bit more about COVID death rates are NOT reading Scientific American So who is the audience for this article people who are already vaccinated and boosted and people who probably wear masks to Target but maybe still go out to the movies go to a concert or go out to get a beer with friends theyre the ones responsible for 1000000 COVID deaths? Thats really the narrative we want to go with in 2022 when the Supreme Court struck down Bidens proposal for a national vaccine mandate the GOP refused to pass the Build Back Better bill when it included a ton of social welfare that could have helped bolster long-term changes and the CDC fixed the isolation guidance because a CEO basically said having people stay home while sick was hurting his bottom line? The fact that the author of this article cant even define what he means by "comprehensive pandemic measures" demonstrates that he cares more about sounding smart than actually discussing what factual changes need to be made The fact that the author and people like him do not grasp the fact that preventing more mass death cannot come without higher vaccination rates--which are hardly mentioned in this article at all for some reason--is a sign that many Americans are failing to grasp what is actually helping to prevent deaths both in this country and across the entire world Until more Americans wake up and finally realize what is actually needed were going to continue to see more preventable deaths and shaming people who have already done what they were supposed to do to help other is not going to help anyone,duncan-the-wonderdog,16456576190,5
