ho1fm7h,rdg5q3,If anyone thinks that child sex trafficking is fake news then you havent been paying attention to what happens every year in our country and the poorest countries around the world! These people prey on the poor just as they abuse them for work they also use them for their own devious purposes! This is as old as our history MEN have sought out the vulnerable and taken advantage of them and abused them for whatever purpose they wanted! As a survivor of this type of destructive behavior it has taken me a long time to realize that it wasnt my fault but it breaks you down piece by piece until you start self medicating and then you are deemed a delinquent though the judges and lawyers know what happens when a child is thrust into something like this they have no compassion for the children they add abuse on top of the abuse! We have tried to bury this stuff for too long and it is time for those who are elected to protect and serve have to be held accountable and forced to start doing their job! I could tell all of the heart wrenching stories but it will not help to change some of the peoples minds that are in charge! The only time that they come close to caring is when it happens to a child of status and even then they try to bury it! They have the money to pay off the officials in the right places and it just keeps happening! I spent most of my life with anger and self medication and it hasnt really been much help I hope that this is a start to holding them accountable maybe this one woman will open the door for all to see just how pervasive this really is but she is going to have to draw a roadmap to how these people do the things they do!

gzz0w5o,no85l1,As usual Im going to throw some cold reason on this tweet First off the money is going to NASA not Bezos NASA will likely contract to Blue Origin not Bezos to do the work Why is the distinction important? Because the implication that Bezos is just shunting this money from pocket to pocket is wildly inaccurate Even if he could do that the SEC would come down on him like a ton of bricks if he did so Plus Amazon doesnt need the money They can float the $85B to buy MGM all on their own without their founders help Okay so next The tweet says "Senate is considering" which if you understand how the Senate works is code for "some Senator introduced an amendment" but said in a way that tries to make it sound more like the whole Senate is unified in this direction In fact there is an active amendment already being floated to block the previous amendment which amounts to pork-barrelling If you want to learn more about this please check out these articles: * https://theinterceptcom/2021/05/25/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-senate-bailout/ -- "Cantwells amendment is no sure bet [] Bernie Sanders [] introduced a last-minute amendment Monday to eliminate the $10 billion [saying] It does not make a lot of sense to me that we would provide billions of dollars to a company owned by the wealthiest guy in America Sanders told The Intercept Tuesday" * https://wwwwashingtonpostcom/technology/2021/05/21/elon-musk-jeff-bezos-moon-rivalry/ * https://thehillcom/homenews/senate/555426-senate-competitiveness-bill-includes-10b-authorization-for-bezos-space,Tyler_Zoro,16223809920,24

I dont know I just know it could be done Remember though its not really as common as it seems on tv Even if they could double or triple the rate you are still much more likely to be effected by smoking or heart disease All they would need is two or three separate instances a week to influence the psyche of the nation,FailOsprey,16188707140,1

i0zezv3,tg0kom,I posted this almost a year ago and have kept copying and pasting it because a lot of it has come true since then Ill warn you its long though This is a copy from another post but lines up the events of history that are being copied right now And why so many *Financial Issues* are being disguised (such as climate issues or pandemic issues) But a lot of this has happened before and is being full-on copied from other time periods and how even blackrock (the single largest hedge fund and called "The Fourth Branch of the US Government by Forbes and Bloomberg) [wrote the entire financial blueprint of what was going to happen before covid even started back in August 2019](https://wwwblackrockcom/corporate/literature/whitepaper/bii-macro-perspectives-august-2019pdf) Were seeing a complete system change why we needed to pump out a ton of money (literally 40% of all Dollars in existence were created in the last year) and why we need a WORLDWIDE unique Identification system tied to single individuals and a unique ID (a passport that is financial in its requirement but right now is being pushed through medical global requirements) Corona is a financial issue disguised as a pandemic issue because it can circumvent local laws and force the wordlwide laws Climate change is a financial issue being disguised as an ecosystem issue because again those laws are "bigger" than local laws and can circumvent normal procedures ----- We know "follow the money" to be the oldest and truest sense of deducing whats going on One of the things that stands out is that this event is following exactly the same events of the 20s and 70s Both times marked by huge inflation both times marked by a currency change and a new system and both times marked by a war that took place to get rid of the old system and expand the system while countries are hit hard by inflation But they all follow the same play ook = a massive amount of money was printed out and a certain assets price was then crashed that people were holding onto In the 20s-30s the asset was gold (whos price skyrocketed as money was printed and then crashed right before a market crash) and now with crypto currency (bitcoin was $7200 in january 2020 and got up to $60000 before crashing down to $32000 and flying back up to $65000 again and will probably crash even further once again before the final drop before it raises to crazy levels in ten years) In the case of gold the conspiracy is that two men formed a group and tried to corner the market and then the US released all its gold shares to crash that market and everyone sold their gold the US then used that price to buy gold from people and then backed the dollar with gold and even made owning it illegal alsoone of those two men who tried cornering the market was the Presidents brother in law so it was clearly a setup and a lot of people lost money but the US gained a lot of gold at cheaper prices right before switching the currency to be backed by gold So it was all about currency So why is the same thing happening again? August was the 50th year anniversary of Nixon ending the gold backed dollar in the 70s and starting the petro backed dollar So what does the end of the currency look like? Remember I said there was a crash for gold because the US released all its stores and crashed the market? Well guess [who owns the most bitcoin](https://wwwwiredcom/2013/12/fbi-wallet/)? Well for starters everyone will need a personal wallet (hence a vaccine passport for tracking is going to come sooner or later but this is the best excuse) The current chair of the SEC (Gary Gensler) who was installed in April taught a class about crypto currency at MIT Sloane (which is an enlightening resource if you want to see how officials view crypto currencies) He even talks about bitcoin finishing a 10 year testing phase and how it survived {what does that even mean? I thought Satoshi Nakamoto was an anonymous person I thought crypto was all about a decentralized financial platform and yet the current head of the SEC says it survived a testing phase?} So what else do we know signifies the end of the petro dollar? Weve all seen how much climate change pops up Well plastics are part of the oil system and thats part of the end too is my guess I know people think its an environmental factor for climate change but we all know that the biggest changes arent happening (a very tiny percentage accounts for the most pollutants but nothing is done about those) But following the money its clear that climate change is a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue This is extremely clear because two separate Senate and house committees met with banks in May about climate changewhy would they meet with banks instead of oil companies or manufacturers? Again the evidence points to a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue But theyre pushing us simply to change what system we consume while avoiding the largest climate change pollutants And even ending the oil system next is energy sourcingwell enter in Afghanistan popping up again and the Taliban/ISIS (which is where the largest lithium deposit is) But the key point is that we will move off of seaparate working grids (because even if you steal gasoline it still works on your vehicle) onto one grid that uses unique identification (which electrical vehicles already do but again is part of the movement away from the machine driven system and into the computer/tracking system) And what about the old infrastructure? Have you noticed how all those hacking attacks kept happening to old infrastructure key points? And the hackers keep asking other countries for huge amount of bitcoin? Have you noticed how war keeps popping up involving all those countries on the old system? Must be a complete coincidence Im sure But well know for sure this is the case if the market crashes soon Hyperinflation is close and technically happening but the FED refuses to acknowledge it (crazy how we dont vote for the FED president and yet they control the entire economy) Weve now had the largest 12 month increase in inflation since 1983 The CPI has changed over and over how inflation is measured true inflation is estimated anywhere from 13% - 25% (but you already know that and likely got your rent hiked already up 20% year-over-year) Thats what happened in the 30s right as they switched to a new backing for the dollar (with Gold) and were seeing all the signs present now that this is true If were about to end the machine driven age and start the computer driven stage then we would each need a unique wallet address and a passport can accompany that It would be the easiest way to install worldwide tracking (since crypto provides a ledger for everything) Also well know bitcoin prices will shoot through the roof after a crash if all this is true and happens Either way this ties corona (an excuse for mass printing of money) the vaccine (more money and a unique wallet tied to ID) end of petro dollar and machine age (climate change is a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue end of plastics from oil) end of the retail to stores system and move to full digital marketplace the beginning of the crypto dollar and crashing the crypto markets (already happened but still can drop much farther along with the rest of the market similar to exact same scenarios in the past) Were entering into the most tracked age of all time everything on the planet will be tracked back to unique ids and monitored on a blockchain/verified by a computer "The Great Reset" might sound like a conspiracy meme but thats an awful lot of coordination to happen in a short period of time Even better since I wrote this the IMF and 10 countries got together in Israel and [Simulated a Cyber Attack that would shut down the Global Financial System](https://financeyahoocom/news/exclusive-imf-10-countries-simulate-133015124html) Im sure thats just a coincidence too! Im sure once it happens everyone will be shocked and demand answersthat they already have Its coming my guess is at the start of Bidens second term since thats when they did it with Nixon Ill keep writing this and if Im wrong I will stop but weve been checking off each point from that paper by Blackrock ever since corona started Every company put money back into their company and was given a massive amount with the PPP loans and every country matched financial and monetary policies and was given massive amounts of money during corona Soif the market started showing signs of a massive failure in 2019 and this paper was put out in August 2019 and weve followed every item line by line of this outline since then and it came before coronathen what does that say about corona This was the single largest robbery in history and unless you are in the 1% then you are going to be the one paying for it You paid for it not just with two full years of your life hearing about this you didnt just pay by having communities torn apart or having to hear people argue about things that arent the actual problem you didnt just pay for it by having to actually stay in solitary confinement that includes the ability to watch your phone and the internetyou literally are going to actually pay for the rest of your life with the inflation costs and debt Well see if this is rightbut weve already checked off most the points from that paper The rich got so insanely rich since this happened It was literally the best year for Wall Street but how was it for most people?,garthsworld,16474938020,2

I really do not remember in any history of a war undertaken with such combined injustice and baseness Ordinary wars of conquest are to me far less wicked than to go to war in order to maintain smuggling and that smuggling consisting in the introduction of a demoralizing drug which the government of China wishes to keep out and which we for the lucre of gain want to introduce by force; and in this quarrel are going to burn and slay in the pride of our supposed superiority  Thomas Arnold to W W Hull March 18 1840 http://wwwvictorianweborg/history/empire/opiumwars/opiumwars1html 3 https://webarchiveorg/web/20180311121505/https://sacuorg/opium2html See also Opium in China In 1997 the colony of Hong Kong was returned to China Hong Kong Island became a British possession as a direct result of the Opium War the opening shots of which were fired 150 years ago All Chinese regardless of political ideology have condemned this armed confrontation as an unjust and immoral contest As far as they are concerned Britians waging a war for the sake of selling a poisonous drug constitutes the most shameful leaf of human history In the hindsight provided by subsequent events in China it is perhaps easy to condemn this act of British aggression but it is less certain that the event was seen in the same condemnatory light by Chinese and foreign observers a century and a half ago 4 Article on opium trade in 1920s Shanghai http://streetsofshanghaipbworkscom/w/page/18638691/Opium Opium (yapian ) Shanghai was built on the opium trade Before the 1850s Shanghai was the terminal port for coastal opium traffic Shanghai was opened to foreign trade on November 11th 1843 and very soon afterwards Jardines (the biggest British company in China at the time) set up a branch there and hired Chinese compradors one of whom was solely concerned with the supervision of opium By 1845 the opium moving through Shanghai constituted almost half of all the opium imported into China In 1880 nearly 13000000 pounds of opium came into China mainly from India By 1900 imports declined because China was now producing an average of 45000000 pounds of opium per annum itself There were at least 15000000 Chinese opium addicts  in Chengdu there was one opium den for every 67 inhabitants of the city In Shanghai some foreign missionaries began to complain that their homes were almost entirely surrounded by opium dens behind bamboo fences The city had more than eighty shops where the drug was sold openly in its crude form and there were over 1500 opium housesThe owners of these establishments bought their supplies from three major opium firms in the International Settlement  the Zhengxia Guoyu and Liwei All three were owned by Swatow (Chaozhou) merchants who formed a consortium This consortium obtained its opium from four foreign merchant houses: David Sassoon & Co ED Sassoon SJ David and Edward Ezra 5 Opium financed British rule in India http://newsbbccouk/2/hi/south\_asia/7460682stm What did you discover in the course of your research? How big was the trade? Opium steadily accounted for about 17-20% of Indian revenues If you think in those terms \[the fact that\] one single commodity accounted for such an enormous part of your economy is unbelievable extraordinary How and when did opium exports out of India to China begin? The idea of exporting opium to China started with Warren Hastings (the first governor general of British India) in 1780 The situation was eerily similar to \[what is happening\] today There was a huge balance of payments problem in relation to China China was exporting enormous amounts but wasnt interested in importing any European goods That was when Hastings came up with idea that the only way of balancing trade was to export opium to China,shylock92008,16270047200,2
h67hnxn,opbmcz,IS ANYONE APOLOGIZING TO GARY WEBB? by Michael Levine (DEA-RET) Gary Webb just in case youve already forgotten him was the journalist who in a well researched understated article entitled "The Dark Alliance" linked the CIA supported Contras to cocaine and weapons being sold to a California street gang and ended up literally being hounded out of journalism by every mainstream news peddling organization in the Yellow Pages Even his own employer The San Jose Mercury piled on for the kill And guess what? The CIA finally admitted yesterday in the New York Times no less that they in fact did "work with" the Nicaraguan Contras while they had information that they were involved in cocaine trafficking to the United States An action known to us court qualified experts and federal agents as Conspiracy to Import and Distribute Cocainea federal felony punishable by up to life in prison To illustrate how us regular walking around non CIA types are treated when we violate this law while I was serving as a DEA supervisor in New York City I put two New York City police officers in a federal prison for Conspiracy to distribute Cocaine when they looked the other way at their friends drug dealing We could not prove they earned a nickel nor that they helped their friend in any way they merely did not do their duty by reporting him They were sentenced to 10 and 12 years respectively and one of them I was recently told had committed suicide I have spent three decades as a court qualified expert and federal agent and am not aware of any class of American Citizen having special permission to violate the law that we have been taxed over $1 trillion in the past two decades to enforce; the law that every politician bureaucrat and media pundit keeps telling us protects us against the most serious danger to American security in our historyThe interesting thing to me about the Webb article is that the CIA is provably (and now admittedly) responsible for much larger scale drug trafficking than Webb alleged or even imagined in his report In fact according to a confidential DEA report entitled "Operation Hun a Chronology" that I used as part of the proof to back up the undercover experiences detailed in my book The Big White Lie (optioned for a movie by Robert Greenwald Productions) the CIA was actively blocking DEA from indicting many members of the ruling government of Bolivia from 1980-83during a time period that these same people were responsible for producing more than 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States As CIA Inspector General Hitz himself stated before congress it was during this time period that Nicaraguan Contra supporters were buying large amounts of cocaine from these same CIA protected Bolivians Do you think Congress wants to see this proof? The gang that cant spy straight as they are known to my listeners and about whom President Lyndon Johnson once said "When Rich folks dont trust their sons with the family money they send them on down to the CIA" certainly did a lot more damage to this nation than for example computer company owner Will Foster who was sentenced to 93 years in prison for possession of 70 marijuana plants for medicinal use Of course true to their shifty sleazy form while admitting that they did aid and abet Contra drug trafficking they are now refusing to release their own final investigative report which details the damning proof The same report that CIA Inspector General Fredrick Hitz during February 1998 had promised congress and the American people was forthcoming "shortly" because as CIA Director George Tenet now claims CIA does not have enough money in its budget to properly classify it You believe that then I know an old guy with a beard named Fidel wandering the streets of South Miami with an Island about 90 miles off the coast for sale He says the money is for his retirement How you ask do they get away with it? Well for one thing mainstream media the so-called Fourth Estate does all it can to help During the Iran-contra hearings when Senators Kerry and Damato were making pronouncements before the Senate indicating that the CIA was involved with drug trafficking Katherine Graham the owner of The Washington Post addressed a class of CIA recruits at CIAs Langley headquarters in November 1988 by saying: "There are some things the general public does not need to know and shouldnt I believe democracy flourishes when the government can take legitimate steps to keep its secrets and when the press can decide whether to print what it knows" Apparently CIA protection of drug trafficking was among those secrets Thus it should have been no surprise to those CIA agent recruits when Washington Post reporter and drug expert Michael Itsikoff wrote that there was "no credible evidence" linking the CIA supported contras to cocaine trafficking at the same time very credible evidence was being heard by Senator Kerrys committee indicating that the Contras may have been the top purveyors of drugs to Americans in our historyNeither should it have been a surprise to anyone who heard her statement when mainstream media refused to print the news that Oliver North US Ambassador to Costa Rica Lewis Tambs and various top level CIA officers were banned from ever entering Costa Rica by Nobel Prize winning President Oscar Arias for drug running The drugs by the way all going to us Nor should it have been a surprise when Gary Webb was destroyed by mainstream media for doing nothing more or less than telling the truth as he found it And now while CIA admits their felonies to the press but refuses to release the proof and Janet Reno the head of the Obstruction of Justice Department has done the unprecedented by classifying her own departments investigation into CIA drug trafficking the partnership for a Drug Free America is spending $2 billion of our tax money on already-proven-fruitless anti-drug ads And where do you think the money goes? Answer: to every major media corporation on the big board Gary Webb my friend you are owed a huge apology But I doubt that youll get it Not in this lifetime,shylock92008,16270105150,2

h6724ku,opbmcz,From 1982 to 1995 the CIA did not to have to report if they suspected any of their agents of dealing drugs Why? Its the kind of government exchange you assume never actually takes place But it did And it went something like this: CIA Chief: Dear Attorney General Do you mind if CIA agents or informants are dealing drugs? I mean we dont have to tell on them do we? Attorney General: Of course not! Well you did But I just changed the law Dont worry about it CIA Chief: Gee thanks! This may sound absurd but according to a series of recently declassified documents obtained by the MoJo Wire its just what happened in the spring of 1982 Letter From Bill Casey To William French Smith https://webarchiveorg/web/20070613130342/https://wwwciagov/library/reports/general-reports-1/cocaine/contra-story/01gif Letter From William French Smith to Bill Casey https://webarchiveorg/web/20070613154234/https://wwwciagov/library/reports/general-reports-1/cocaine/contra-story/02gif Letter from the DOJ Codifying the MOU https://webarchiveorg/web/20070613051429/https://wwwciagov/library/reports/general-reports-1/cocaine/contra-story/14gif Central Intelligence Agency Director William Caseys request to then-Attorney General William French Smith isnt in the public domain But two letters one from Smith thanking Casey for his request and a follow-up by Casey are both available They were released as part of a internal CIA report that explored allegations of CIA involvement in drug trafficking (The most comprehensive allegations were reported by Gary Webb in a series of San Jose Mercury News reports and a book entitled "Dark Alliance") In the first document Smith thanks Casey for his letter (the one that isnt public) and says: "in view of the fine cooperation the Drug Enforcement Administration has received from CIA no formal requirement regarding the reporting of narcotics violations has been included in these procedures"--William French SmithAttorney General Casey in return thanks the Attorney General for his understanding: "I am pleased that these procedures which I believe strike the proper balance between enforcement of the law and protection of intelligence sources and methods will now be forwarded to other agencies"--William J CaseyDirector Central Intelligence Agency\[See the full document\] The two men then codified their agreement in a Memorandum of Understanding According to the agreement intelligence agencies would not have to report if any of their agents were involved in drug running (By agents the agreement meant CIA sources and informants Full-time employees still couldnt deal drugs) That understanding remained in effect until August of 1995 when current Attorney General Janet Reno rescinded the agreement Its reasonable that the CIA be allowed to keep its mouth shut if it knows that some of its agents are involved in minor illegal affairs Presumably some of the value of informants comes from the fact that they keep company with shady characters who engage in unlawful activities But why would the CIA ask to be exempt specifically from drug enforcement laws? According to Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif) who is calling for full disclosure of the facts "The CIA knew that the Contras were dealing drugs They made this deal with the Attorney General to protect themselves from having to report it" Some of the remaining questions may still be answered The Department of Justice and the CIA have finished separate investigations into possible CIA involvement in drug smuggling But neither report has been made available to the public; the Justice department cites an "ongoing investigation" while the CIA says their report is an internal document and therefore classified Says Congresswoman Waters: "What is it they dont want Americans to see?

h674p5o,opbmcz,1998: CIA Says It Used Nicaraguan Rebels Accused of Drug Tie; By James Risen July 17 1998 ; "The agencys decision to keep those paid agents or to continue dealing with them in some less formal relationship was made by top officials at headquarters in Langley Va" - NYT  https://wwwnytimescom/1998/07/17/world/cia-says-it-used-nicaraguan-rebels-accused-of-drug-tiehtml CIA Says It Used Nicaraguan Rebels Accused of Drug Tie By James Risen July 17 1998 The Central Intelligence Agency continued to work with about two dozen Nicaraguan rebels and their supporters during the 1980s despite allegations that they were trafficking in drugs according to a classified study by the CIA The new study has found that the agencys decision to keep those paid agents or to continue dealing with them in some less formal relationship was made by top officials at headquarters in Langley Va in the midst of the war waged by the CIA-backed contras against Nicaraguas leftist Sandinista Government The new report by the CIAs inspector general criticizes agency officials actions at the time for the inconsistent and sometimes sloppy manner in which they investigated -- or chose not to investigate -- the allegations which were never substantiated by the agency The inspector generals report which has not yet been publicly released also concludes that there is no evidence that any CIA officials were involved in drug trafficking with contra figures The fundamental finding of the report is that there is no information that the CIA or CIA employees ever conspired with any contra organizations or individuals involved with the contras for purposes of drug trafficking a United States intelligence official said The new report is the long-delayed second volume of the CIAs internal investigation into possible connections between the contras and Central American drug traffickers The investigation was originally prompted by a 1996 series in The San Jose Mercury-News which asserted that a dark alliance between the CIA the contras and drug traffickers had helped finance the contra war with profits from drug smuggling The second volume dismisses those specific charges as did the first volume released in January The series charged that the alliance created a drug trafficking network that introduced crack cocaine into South Central Los Angeles It prompted an enormous outcry especially among blacks many of whom said they saw it as confirmation of a Government-backed conspiracy to keep blacks dependent and impoverished The Mercury-News subsequently admitted that the series was flawed and reassigned the reporter In the declassified version of the CIAs first volume the agency said the Mercury-News charges were baseless and mentioned drug dealers who had nothing to do with the CIA But John M Deutch the Director of Central Intelligence at the time had also asked the inspector general to conduct a broader inquiry to answer unresolved questions about the contra program and drug trafficking that had not been raised by The Mercury-News Frederick Hitz then the CIAs inspector general decided to issue a second larger report to deal with those broader issues Many allegations in the second volume track closely with charges that first surfaced in a 1987 Senate investigation The CIA is reluctant to release the complete 500-page second volume because it deals directly with contras the agency did work with According to the report CIA officials involved in the contra program were so focused on the fight against the Sandinistas that they gave relatively low priority to collecting information about the possible drug involvement of contra rebels The report concluded that CIA officers did report on drug trafficking by the contras but that there were no clear guidelines given to field officers about how intensively they should investigate or act upon the allegations In all the CIA received allegations of drug involvement against about 50 contras or supporters during the war against the Sandinistas the report said Some of the allegations may have been specious the result of Sandinista propaganda American intelligence officials said It could not be determined from the CIAs records how many of the 50 cases were fully investigated But the agency continued to work with about two dozen of the 50 contras according to American intelligence officials familiar with the report They said the report had found that the agency was unable to either prove or disprove the charges or did not investigate them adequately American intelligence officials who provided information about the report declined to identify the individual contras who were the subjects of the drug allegations But they did say that in addition to individual cases the report found that drug allegations had been made against one contra organization a group known as 15th of September That group was formed in 1980 and was disbanded in January 1982 The CIAs decision to classify this second volume has already been met with criticism in Congress Senator John Kerry Democrat of Massachusetts who led a 1987 Congressional inquiry into allegations of contra drug connections wrote a letter Thursday to the Director of Central Intelligence George J Tenet asking that the report be immediately declassified Mr Kerry who has reviewed the second volume of the inspector generals report said he believed that CIA officials involved in the contra program did not make a serious effort to fully investigate the allegations of drug involvement by the contras Some of us in Congress at the time in 1985 1986 were calling for a serious investigation of the charges and CIA officials did not join in that effort Mr Kerry said There was a significant amount of stonewalling Im afraid that what I read in the report documents the degree to which there was a lack of interest in making sure the laws were being upheld A version of this article appears in print on July 17 1998 Section A Page 2 of the National edition

I t is now clear that this agreement began with the events described in THE BIG WHITE LIE; that the top drug traffickers in Bolivia then supplying virtually all the worlds cocaine-including Sonia Atala-were CIA assets that had to be protected from our deep cover probe Laura and I still have the proof of this that we used to back up the publication THE BIG WHITE LIE The same proof was later incorporated into other data backing up the publications of DEEP COVER and TRIANGLE OF DEATH [https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/](https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/) Our evidence-which congress has been craning its neck not to see- for instance shows clearly that during Operation Hun (the story in The Big White Lie) secret meetings were held with CIA and Justice Department wherein all indictments of top government officials in Bolivia were blocked We now believe this agreement began because of Operation Hun CIA had to hide the fact that they were supporting the people manufacturing virtually all the cocaine being produced in the world at that time In Deep Cover we showed that during Operation Trifecta-a highly successful deep cover probe into the top of the drug world in three countries (Panama Bolivia and Mexico) -Attorney General of the US Ed Meese found it necessary to warn the Attorney General of Mexico about DEAs case We (undercover DEA agents and Customs agents) found links between top US government officials and the people who murdered DEA agent Kiki Camarena that to this day go unexamined by our congress or anyone else In "TRIANGLE OF DEATH a work of "faction" we showed CIAs real-life involvement in the protection and creation of one of the most murderous criminal organizations to ever plague America an organization created by escaped Nazi fugitives under CIA protection-events occurring long before this alleged CIA Justice agreement And so the dance continues If anyone watched the CNN show you cannot have helped but notice the snickering on the part of Congressional chairman Porter Goss (an ex CIA officer) as congresswoman Maxine Waters spoke Now heres the reason why: Sources of mine who speak to me from inside this veil of secrecy out of conscience and because I am cheaper and more reliable than a psychiatrist have already told me the following: There is secret communication between CIA and members of the Congressional staff-one must keep in mind that Porter Goss the chairman is an ex CIA official- indicating that the whole hearing is just a smoke and mirror show so that the American people-particularly the Black community- can "blow off some steam" without doing any damage to CIA The CIA has been assured that nothing real will be done other than some embarrassing questions being asked That the hearings will result in the CIA receiving even a larger budget than the current $26 billion that they admit to One of the most distressing things for me a 25 year veteran of this business to listen to was when Congresswoman Waters said that the hearings were not about CIA officers being indicted and going to jail "That is not going to happen" she said Almost in the same breath she spoke of a recent case in Miami wherein a Venezuelan National Guard general was caught by Customs agents smuggling more than a ton of cocaine into the US Despite named CIA officers being involved in the plot as Congresswoman Waters stated the Justice Department will not tell her anything about the case because of "secrecy laws" No wonder chairman Goss was snickering She could not have played more neatly into CIA hands than to surrender before the battle was engaged For the entire existence of CIA they have gotten away with doing more damage to the American people than all our traditional enemies combined precisely because no one was ever prosecuted From the CIA protection of Nazi criminals from war crimes prosecution as they set up criminal organizations that preyed on America (Triangle of Death) to their lies to President Kennedy that dragged us into Bay of Pigs to their lies to President Johnson that dragged us into the Vietnam War to their creation of a pan Arab army of American hating drug trafficking terrorists during the Afghan War to the Church Commission hearings to MK-Ultra to the Bolivian Cocaine Coup ("The Big White Lie") to their protection of the worlds top cocaine traffickers as they laid waste to American streets (Deep cover) the CIA has acted exactly as Senator Frank Church once described them: "a runaway rogue elephantcompletely unresponsive to Congressthey (the CIA) have not only been unproductive they have been contra productive they have brought great shame on America" And the dance continues &#x200B;

I want to understand what the thought process is Im not a people person and so far I havent needed to be one Maybe I just dont have the world experience yet I got sort of thrust into adulthood a bit before the pandemic and got my bearings while it hit I just desperately want to understand why I cant bring myself to be angry at people who are so ignorant of their own situation Maybe Im just too compassionate or just dumb Im just not one to be angry like some other folks here are (rightfully so) Tl;dr for my inability to pare down the rambling the Midwest has imprinted into my European brain: Does anyone at all have any sort of insight into the anti science people?

The amount of individuals who would follow a religion that specifically states they can not have a vaccine due to their theological teachings HAS to be minuscule and I personally feel most people saying its a religious reason are liars > Buddhism - Buddhism has no central authority that determines doctrine Vaccination is widely accepted in predominantly Buddhist countries > Christianity - The Christian faith consists of multiple different denominations which may differ in theological approach to vaccines > The following Christian denominations have no theological objection to vaccination: Roman Catholicism Eastern Orthodox Oriental Orthodox Amish Anglican Baptist The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormon) Congregational Episcopalian Jehovahs Witness - Note: This denomination originally denounced vaccination but revised this doctrine in 1952 An article in a recent issue of the churchs newsletter promotes vaccination to avoid infectious diseases Lutheran Mennonite Methodist (including African Methodist Episcopal) Quaker Pentecostal Presbyterian Seventh-Day Adventist Unitarian-Universalist The following denominations do have a theological objection to vaccination: Dutch Reformed Congregations - This denomination has a tradition of declining immunizations Some members decline vaccination on the basis that it interferes with divine providence However others within the faith accept immunization as a gift from God to be used with gratitude Faith healing denominations including: Faith Tabernacle Church of the First Born Faith Assembly End Time Ministries Church of Christ Scientist - One of the basic teachings of this denomination is that disease can be cured or prevented by focused prayer and members will often request exemptions when available However there are not strict rules against vaccination and members can receive required vaccinations > Hinduism - Hinduism has no prohibition against vaccines While Hindus venerate cows trace bovine components of certain vaccines have not been identified as a theological concern > Islam - Islam has no prohibition to vaccination There have been several gatherings of Muslim leaders scholars and philosophers to address the theological implications of ingredients in food and drugs including vaccination The Organization of Islamic Conference and 15th annual conference of the International Fiqh Council both concluded that vaccination is acceptable under Islam The Islamic Organization for Medical Sciences concluded that porcine gelatin used in vaccines is acceptable Some muftis (experts in Islamic law) hold that immunization is obligatory (wajib) when the disease risk is high and the vaccine has benefits that far outweigh its risk > Jainism - Jains follow a path of non-violence toward all living beings including microscopic organisms Jains do allow cooking the use of soap and antibiotics and vaccination because this destruction of microorganisms even though regretted is necessary to protect other lives > Judaism - Judaism supports vaccination as an action to maintain health and also as a parental responsibility to protect children against future infection In Judaism the concept of Pikuakh nefesh acting to save ones own or anothers life is a primary value While some vaccines containing porcine derived gelatin Jewish scholars agree that porcine gelatin in injectable form is acceptable > Scientology: in an interview for BeliefNet Rev John Carmichael of the Church of Scientology stated that there are no precepts or strictures about vaccinations within Scientology https://wwwvumcorg/health-wellness/news-resource-articles/immunizations-and-religion,cats_catz_kats_katz,16300867500,83

gwja6gl,n2hns4,**Michigan is now hospitalizing more people under 40 than those over 80 for COVID-19** Dr Stacey Sensor says her 18-year-old son a high school senior is "one of the healthiest people I know" "He works out every single day at five oclock in the morning" said Sensor a Gaylord physician "He takes all these supplements He only eats healthy And he got COVID at the gym "He was quite sick for about eight days" she said "So Im telling you that it doesnt matter what supplements you take what your age is Even in the healthiest individual they still can get it and they can still become very sick and then the effects can be there for quite some time" Its a cautionary tale she said for people who see COVID-19 as a serious health threat for the elderly but a much more benign illness for younger healthier people In fact Michigans current coronavirus surge has turned that assumption on its head: Last week the state was averaging more hospital admissions for COVID patients under 40 than patients age 80 or older The former was about 78 a day compared to 50 for the latter according to data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services The biggest reason for the demographic shift experts say: The difference in vaccination rates About 74% of Michigan residents age 70 and older have gotten at least one dose of vaccine and two-thirds are fully vaccinated For those 16 to 49 the numbers are 36% who have gotten one dose and 23% fully immunized; there is no vaccine authorized for children under 16 Also contributing to the surge of virus among young people is the spread of variants that are both more contagious and more lethal; the tendency of many younger adults to disregard COVID-19 guidelines and the fact that schools have reopened "Its definitely become more of a young person disease now probably because they havent been vaccinated and theyve been more likely than older folks to go out and about be in close contact with others and go to gatherings" said Dr Mark Hamed a physician who is medical director for Huron Lapeer Sanilac Tuscola Alcona Iosco Ogemaw and Oscoda counties The numbers bear that out In the first year of the pandemic Michigan residents age 60 and older accounted for 23% of cases; its now 13% Conversely those under age 20 accounted for 13% of cases during the first 12 months of the pandemic; its now 25% The chart below shows the April case numbers by age group compared to the monthly average through March 2021 as well as compared to December 2020 during the fall surge [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/WNTiwqVd1gGfPM09p2D0qzVgFZY=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/VQGMMSPTZNGADOVJQPKGAWILMQPNG) In theory thats actually a welcomed shift from the standpoint that old age is easily the biggest risk factor for being hospitalized or dying of COVID-19 But experts have been taken aback by the spike in COVID-19 hospitalizations among younger adults and children Compared to the height of the fall surge in early December Michigans average daily hospitalization admissions for COVID-19 are up 33% for those age 18 to 29 58% for thirty-somethings and 64% for those in their 40s Meanwhile hospitalizations for those age 80 and older are down 60% compared to December [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/86v1e7Apdm4-zWbHd-9Q7X4rAh0=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/RPEUG3IW5JGXTF6HQYL2RBK67Upng) "Its like you take what we were seeing before and shift it down by one or two decades" said Dr Joel Fishbain an infectious disease specialist for Beaumont Hospital in Grosse Pointe "Weve got 20-year-olds who are getting admitted and 30-year-olds requiring oxygen which we never saw before and needing as much treatment as we can give them Weve got 40- and 50-year-olds ending up on ventilators" Pediatric cases also are up Last week the state was averaging almost 10 hospital admissions a day among pediatric patients with COVID-19 triple the number in mid-February Deaths among children and younger adults have spiked too In the first 13 months of the pandemic there were six deaths among children ages 10 to 19 In the past month four deaths were reported Another 65 deaths were reported in April for 20- and 30-somethings quadruple the monthly average The chart below compares April deaths to the monthly average through March 2021 as well as to confirmed COVID deaths in December The numbers show how deaths among seniors plummeted in April compared to December as a result of vaccinations while coronavirus variants spiked deaths among unvaccinated people under age 50 [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/caQyJGE9C2BiswUM2ThU22RJumk=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/ZXCIGC7VWZCN7H65ULFSFE4GPIPNG) Deaths and hospitalizations arent the only concern While most COVID patients under age 50 "dont get severely ill there are a growing number of people who have long-haul COVID symptoms" said Dr Liam Sullivan an infectious disease specialists with Spectrum Health in Grand Rapids "They have problems with smelling with taste with concentration with memory with fatigue with night sweats "So even though they had a mild illness the first time around theyre still dealing with these things month and months later and thats not something you want to deal with when youre 25 or 35" he said "Of course you dont want to deal with it at any age but especially when youre in the prime of your life" And for women the research is growing on the dangers of COVID-19 during pregnancy Dr Kurt Wharton an Oakland County obstetrician currently has four pregnant patients in intensive care units battling COVID-19 All four are "fighting for their lives" said Wharton who works at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak While COVID-19-related deaths among pregnant women remain very rare Wharton and others say the evidence is growing that coronavirus during pregnancy can put a woman at a much higher risk of preterm birth preeclampsia and admission to the ICU and/or intubation especially if the woman has pre-existing conditions such as high blood pressure obesity diabetes or heart disease Evidence growing on COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy: Virus is dangerous; the shots are not Doctors offer several theories on why more younger people are getting significantly ill with COVID-19 in the current surge One is the spread of variants which are both more contagious and more lethal The variants are "stickier" Hamed said which means it takes less exposure to make someone severely ill or even symptomatic Wharton noted the same pattern happened during the 1918 influenza pandemic The initial surge in the spring of 1918 primarily impacted the elderly and babies But the virus mutated and came roaring back in the fall of 1918 and its primary victims during that surge were younger adults "History is repeating itself" Wharton said Another issue suggests Hamed and others: More unvaccinated people are gathering in groups without masks That increases the risk of exposure to a higher viral load which has been associated with more severe disease "The best mask you wear the less viral load you inhale" Wharton said On top that many schools have reopened and children and younger adults in particular are resuming their pre-pandemic social lives "You can see it" Wharton said "Younger people are all out in groups again walking down sidewalks shopping going to restaurants and bars together They just think theyre invulnerable" The good news is that COVID-19 vaccinations have proven "wildly successful" in significantly reducing the chances of getting the virus and spreading to others Sullivan said And just as vaccinations have blunted spread of the virus among senior citizens the spread of COVID among younger adults can be stymied through immunization shots Vaccination programs "really need to target the younger people right now" Sensor said "Theyre the ones who are getting sick Weve done a really good job of vaccinating our older population but to really move forward and get out of this pandemic we really need our younger people to step up to the plate and get the vaccine to protect themselves and protect their families",itsdr00,16198732450,154

I would assume I have little or nothing to worry about although I guess I should be more mindful of any symptoms just in case It does not hurt to be diligent and keep an eye out for myself I really dont know what to make of all this I "guess" being vaccinated was still the right choice I would argue the alternative could have been worse I made an informed choice with the information I had which is really all anyone could do right?! ,Linux-Is-Best,16183299540,2

gue5f9l,mpzwzj,https://healthscimcmasterca/news-events/news/news-article/2021/03/22/mcmaster-scientist-resolves-covid-19-clot-question If the clotting is caused by the immune response (antibodies and platelets) wont it stand to reason that the patient could be given blood thinners on a temporary basis? I think the antibodies go away after a period of time (how long?) and then its the remaining T-Cells that help with an immune response during the next exposure? So presumably there would be no need to be on blood thinners permanently? Although what confuses me is this: Once we go back to normal and people have been vaccinated isnt the whole point that their body will ramp up and make a ton of antibodies real quick in response to exposure to the actual virus? Does this mean there is a risk of blood clotting due to viral exposure for those who have been vaccinated regardless of the vaccine? I need someone who understands immunology better than me to explain all this Does it seem like those who are having the severe reaction to the vaccine are the same folks who would have had a crazy immune system overreaction to the virus? What is it about some peoples immune systems? It is kind of scary to think that were trying to vaccinate for a virus where the main cause of virulence is it wrecks havoc on the immune system,Calendar_Girl,16183348630,1

h28g44h,nzm2oo,most of the comments in here make me realize the internet is full of people that just read headlines and never the article The article headline is flimsy at best based on the data as I see no strong correlation between covid numbers rising and getting the jab There are almost equal amounts of low vax rates and low cases as there are high vax rate low cases and further pa for example is almost above the national avg and yet advertises over a 70% vax rate If you consider those that had covid plus those that have been jabbed shouldnt pa be at herd immunity? What this also doesnt take into consideration are variants In certain counties which they curiously picked but I probably would have too in my study there is no differentiator for variants We are already seeing strong real world data showing that many of the vaccines are very ineffective against the D variant originally discovered in India Indias numbers have plummeted but there are widespread reports of falsification of data there so much like Chinas reporting I dont think we can trust that this will just disappear I think the UK is our canary in the coalmine at this point so early into the emergence of this variant There are many folks like myself that just simply dont trust the science behind so much of what has occurred since day 1 of this modern day plague Being allergic to PEG to the point that using shampoo with it causes a mild rash I was told not to take the current offerings and wait for better news to come out for the J/J But all we hear from them is bad news between blood clots and corrupted vials in the millions I feel like the entire globe especially reddit users would like to over simplify vaccines and how to stop this disease Remember the idea of a manufactured disease was laughed at and even censored on these very forums not too long ago Now both sides of the political spectrum are realizing there was an orchestrated cover up by Peter Daszak So what new discoveries will there be about the variants the effectiveness claims of the current vaccines against the new variants and long term effects of the vaccine that lets not forget were originally slated for emergency FDA clearance for older and immune compromised individuals because the potential risk of the vaccine far outweighed the potential risk of covid which for those in that category was a very strong chance of death or at a minimum a painful long possibly perpetual recovery period Harvard and Yale doctors came out together and said there is no reason to vaccinate the young the risks are unknown and the risk of covid for those is also low: [https://wwwmsncom/en-us/health/medical/harvard-stanford-doctors-say-mandating-the-coronavirus-vaccine-unethical/vi-AALbqNq?ocid=entnewsntp&pc=U531](https://wwwmsncom/en-us/health/medical/harvard-stanford-doctors-say-mandating-the-coronavirus-vaccine-unethical/vi-AALbqNq?ocid=entnewsntp&pc=U531) Heres my problem with their statements though As someone pointed out the effectiveness of the vaccines are high and your risk of having a break through case drops dramatically if others are also vaccinated Younger people have been known to be asymptomatic and as such are more likely to spread it as younger people are generally more social in person than older people I dont have the answers but to try and paint this as a black/white conversation is foolish I hope the vaccinated dont have long term health issues but if they did you could bet they wouldnt come back on these forums and apologize to those of us that cant get the current vaccines or are fearful because our scientists and medical community especially our government has shown to be at best a bit inept confused and politically motivated,HyprSl0th,16240387040,0

hrpb059,ryb5hr,The hospitalizations are definitely on the rise again and it is hard to predict the peak The healthcare system doesnt have a lot of margin to adjust so this has been a really tough time for every level of the system The good news though is that there are significantly fewer hospitalizations per case so far when compared to all the previous waves In Pennsylvania where one of the doctor interviewed is working the average new cases per day is 22000 and the total number of hospitalized patients is 5600 During the delta wave as the new case levels were nearing their peak in mid September there were only 5800 cases but hospitalizations were already at 2300 4 times as many cases but only twice as many hospitalizations Twice as many hospitalizations terrible for sure but still below the number on the initial wave The article also states that hospitalizations fall 2 weeks behind cases I dont see that trend in the data Total hospitalizations start to go down a week to 10 days after cases start to go down but that is from people being released from the hospital The upward side of the trend seems to be no more than a couple days behind the case count and sometimes not even that All these numbers generally jive in the national numbers as well though with different dates Like I said I feel for hospital workers and their struggle is very real But I think it is helpful to mention the positive trends with the negative ones especially in a time where it can seem like the only news we get is negative Vaccines ARE working Omicron IS less severe than Delta and the mortality rate has been declining consistently There is hope for things to get better (This data is pulled from the CDCs COVID Data Tracker Not posting a link to respect subreddit rules),intrepidpursuit,16415960970,2

"Its not sustainable or affordable to buy every person on the planet a new car each year" Regardless hard to believe that this wouldnt be a solvable problem Especially with variants more likely to come from unvaccinated populations (in poorer countries) theres a huge incentive to build out vaccination infrastructure I wonder how perceptions will change in the future Theres a lot of frustrated "Im done with this" comments in this thread which is fair enough I guess but for me personally if it were a 15 minute errand each year to get a booster / update and mitigate some of the risk of getting covid I cant imagine why I wouldnt do that Ive been getting the flu shot for years Even if it were just a mild reduction in the chances of contracting a mild illness I would still do that,pseudont,16413323950,0

hqtrnvx,rt54vc,This is good news Now dont get me wrong I fully understand that many are in danger but hear this out: do you prefer to get covid while its weaker than ever experience it (in most cases) like the flu and also have antibodies afterwards or experience delta variant which kills way more people than omicron and is overall more dangerous I think omicron signals that we are towards the end of the pandemic cause since it spreads faster than any other it will mean that way more people will get atleast some antibodies which will make them almost immune to covid thus making it way harder to spread until its so weak it can hardly kill or even show symptoms This is the normal outcome of a virus its destined to be like that The problem a virus faces when killing its host is that it cant spread as easy as it would if the host was kept alive If the virus is weaker the host will not die or have any functioning problems so they will probably pass it to others keeping it alive PS: Im no doctor so dont take my words for granted If Im wrong please correct me,XRISTOS128,16410586460,2

The Corona Cabinet approved: Insulation for returnees from abroad African variant Omicron (Photo: Reuters) South Africa has transferred new information to Israel - and this is the data | Photo: Reuters The contradictory messages of vaccine manufacturers The test of the effectiveness of existing vaccines against the new variant was in its infancy but Modern CEO Stefan Bensel managed to arouse global concern today when he said in an interview with the Financial Times that he expects a significant decrease in vaccine efficacy But Bensel spoke of a decline in benefit from a disease with symptoms rather than a serious illness - a difference that is known to be dramatic in corona contexts as Pfizer CEO Albert Burla was apt to describe: Defense compared to Delta but that would be the limit In both cases the booster vaccines are expected to reduce the gap dramatically " Burla who promised to know more about the benefits of the vaccine against the variant in about a week and a half said Pfizer had already begun developing a specific vaccine against the variant a few days ago "We know the genetic linkage of the virus we have it - thats how it starts" he explained "We started at risk to produce a vaccine We actually started on Friday to produce a vaccine based on the flooring the DNA template that would allow us to make RNA that would eventually women within that vaccine" Israel meanwhile is waiting for a more categorical statement from the two CEOs and meanwhile relies on data coming from South Africa - where the variant was first discovered - and from which it appears that the omicron is more contagious but is no more violent "Data on the benefits of the vaccine - there may be some partial data from South Africa" Dr Sharon Elrai-Price head of public health services said today during a debate in the Knesset I know they are doing the lab tests as I described to see how useful the vaccine against this variant is " Bennett worried: "There is a lot of uncertainty" Albert Burla and Naftali Bennett (Adapted by Reuters) Burla optimistic Bennett explains why he activated the GSS | Arrangement: Reuters At the same time the government is today approving a memorandum of law that will allow it to extend the decision to allow the GSS to verify the cellular devices of those infected with Omicron or the suspects who were infected with it with high probability - in order to interrupt the transmission chains as quickly as possible But just before the move reaches the Knesset the coalition itself is sharply critical of the law Prime Minister Bennett - who saw for himself how in the ministers WhatsApp groups Ministers Saar Shasha-Bitton Barbibai and Avidar voted against - told today why Israel decided to include the GSS in the campaign despite and perhaps because it is a low number of infected "There is a lot of uncertainty and that is why we are taking these extreme measures" he said in a video call with Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schlenberg "But our advantage as leaders is that once we know more when there is more information - we can let go of those measures gradually" As for the restrictions at Ben Gurion Airport the prime minister has already decided that these will last about two weeks from the date of the decision - and only if the final proof does come that the variant does not endanger the populations immunity or the omicron is already spread in the community - these restrictions will be removed Yaron Avraham participated in the preparation of the article,Serenity101,16383425550,2

h8g1hqm,p1oqh4,I believe its really important for parents to have an idea of the risks of COVID to children so Ive been doing some research recently to assess the risks **I am not an expert -- so I welcome any comments -- but thought this may be helpful as parents navigate this worrisome time** (sorry if youve seen this before -- Ive reposted this on threads that talk about kids and COVID because I think its important to have some idea behind the risks): **Morality Risks:** Obviously theres an extremely fine line to walk here: every death of a child is horrendously tragic and I cannot imagine being the parent of a child who has died or been hospitalized The good news for parents however is that mortality risks still remain low [Out of 74000000 kids in the US 519 have died of COVID since the crisis began (as of July 28)](https://wwwnytimescom/2021/07/29/well/family/back-to-school-covidhtml) This works out to a mortality rate of 00007% or 0015% amongst those who had had confirmed cases of COVID Again this is immensely tragic -- simply put no child should die -- but if I were a parent Id probably be more worried about the prospects for long-term COVID symptoms (discussed below) **Risks of Delta:** Delta is new so there is still much we do not know However data from the UK (where Delta has hit for some time now) gives us some clues Lets start with the good news: [based on data from the UK kids remain the least impacted age group by a long shot](https://wwwonsgovuk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19latestinsights/hospitals#hospital-admissions-by-age)Despite not having access to vaccines kids age 5-14 still have had by far the lowest hospitalization rates of any demographic (this past week its been 108/100000; kids age 0-4 have had noticeably higher rates -- 312/100k -- though still lower than any other age group) Similarly the chance a child would be hospitalized if they had a confirmed case of COVID was similar to prior waves and maybe even a little bit lower The bad news? Well more kids are going to get Delta on account of it being more transmissible particularly in areas where schools arent taking any precautions We all know it and were seeing it now but Delta is insanely more transmissible The fact were already seeing records for hospitalizations amongst kids is extremely bad to say the least The fact this is already occurring with no indications cases nationally are close to peaking is really troubling (An aside: interestingly the UK never break their record for youth hospitalizations with Delta but were breaking it now I really dont know but if anyone has insight itd be interesting to hear) **Risks of Long COVID/The Disease Course More Generally:** We still have lots to learn about long COVID and Delta is new enough that current studies dont really address it For COVID more generally however the earliest studies suggested frighteningly high rates of long-lasting symptoms (one even pegged it at a third!) But these suffered from immense methodological weaknesses such as low sample sizes parental-reported symptoms probable selection bias and no control groups More recent research (which isnt perfect and still includes many of the above weaknesses but is at least somewhat better) has suggested much lower rates than the first studies albeit the risks are real A sampling of some of the more recent work include: * [In a self-reported survey in the UK over 95% of infected kids had no symptoms lasting longer than four weeks and 98% had no symptoms more than 56 days](https://wwwthelancetcom/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext)(and if Im understanding the study correctly it only analyzed kids with symptomatic COVID so there would be lower rates for all infections) * [In a survey from the UK of people who had COVID an estimated 74% of children aged 2-11 reported any symptoms 12 weeks after infection](https://wwwonsgovuk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/prevalenceofongoingsymptomsfollowingcoronaviruscovid19infectionintheuk/1april2021) (this study included a control group) * [In one study with a control group researchers found that kids infected with COVID in Zurich actually were no more likely to report symptoms of long-COVID than kids who were not infected](https://wwwnaturecom/articles/d41586-021-01935-7)To be clear: this study does not imply that long-Covid does not occur However if true it suggests the actual prevalence of long-COVID in kids is likely quite low (This is definitely the most encouraging study I found) So whats the average course of the illness in most children (again with the caveat that most research is pre-Delta)? First off it seems that \~50% of children will be totally asymptomatic ([the Lancet study](https://wwwthelancetcom/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext) cites a source suggesting between 43-68% of cases are asymptomatic) Of those with symptoms the one study found the median symptom duration is 6 days with the most common symptoms being headache and fatigue (see previous link) Three final notes: First we need to be careful when discussing long-COVID and differentiate between symptoms that are bad but manageable (and resolve over time) and symptoms which are debilitating Unfortunately to my understanding current research has not really addressed this adequately In the Lancet study at least (first bullet point) the most common symptoms that lasted in the children who had lasting symptoms were 1) fatigue 2) loss of smell and 3) (to a lesser degree) headaches This doesnt really resolve the question -- depending on the levels of fatigue for example it certainly can be debilitating -- but I think this is something we really shouldnt lose sight of when discussing long-COVID Second: Ive seen concerns on here about organ damage and the like I havent really seen great studies focusing on this on children (I very well may have missed some so do not take this as gospel) Moreover in the studies Ive run across on adults theres lots of jargon and its not always clear what the medical implications of certain findings are Thus I havent really focused on it here -- not because it might not exist but because its above my expertise and I do not want to misinterpret findings Third risks -- even quantified -- are hard to interpret and people will probably have different reactions to the same numbers Lets say [the Lancet study](https://wwwthelancetcom/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext) (showing 18% of children with symptomatic COVID have any symptoms lasting >56 days) is correct On the one hand -- if your child catches COVID -- this means he/she is extremely unlikely to have symptoms that last that long One the other hand -- this still means lots of kids will have symptoms that last a long time **Takeaways:** Building off this last point: people will look at the above data and likely come to different conclusions For me I look at it and feel somewhat reassured -- its not at all that theres zero risk (theres definitely not) and whats currently happening is absolutely tragic but the data speaks to somewhat lower risks than the impression Id likely get if I spent my whole day on this sub But then again Im also not a parent Others may look at the data (particularly the long-COVID studies) and still very reasonably feel worried **In any event -- and I know Im preaching to the choir here -- the most important thing you can do to protect the kids around you is get vaccinated And if you happen to be a parent with a children age 12 or over whos on the fence please get them vaccinated too Itll protect your child from a truly nasty disease and help lower the risk for those around your child too**,Adodie,16286229860,6

gwtn588,n3u6kx,I know this is great news personally for many American families but I see it as bad news for the rest of the world Were going to start vaccinating teenagers when other countries have barely started vaccinating elderly due to lack of supply and having more eligible Americans means more stockpiling vaccines instead of sending them to where theyre desperately needed,conceptalbums,16200722380,2

gwsez2j,n3u6kx,This is amazing news Vaccinating those 16+ did a lot to dramatically lower Covid spread but we were never going to be able to entirely beat Covid by just vaccinating people 16 and over Currently our Covid rates in the US are similar to what they were in early October but once we start vaccinating those 12+ I would expect that number to drop back down to August and early September levels which would be a big improvement,socialistrob,16200535730,3

hl0fgqi,qw0f3o,Been expecting this since Covid first hit Its a virus that mutates similar to colds and flus No vaccine for colds and flu shots every year Therefore we can most likely expect regular Covid shots Hopefully they will continue to evolve the shots to be more effective against variants but absolutely none of the news about immunity waning or boosters being needed has been a surprise,dawno64,16371703970,67

h1e6irb,nx2q0e,Why do we care about this the cruise company verified that all passengers and crew had a valid vaccine record and were 2 weeks past the last dose everyone was asymptomatic and they only caught it from cautionary routine testing This is what we expect to happen and judging by how they are asymptomatic the vaccine is working as intended It sucks that a handful of people just had their vacation ruined by having to quarantine but its not like theyre going to do anything other than sit in a room for a few days until they test negative I dont see how any of this is breaking news worthy,SpookyDoomCrab42,16234130120,2
