he wrote a White House official that he was in favor of a "National Endowment in support of free institutions throughout the world" >The NED was initially placed under the auspices of the National Security Council and one Walter Raymond Jr a CIA propaganda expert who according to the late Robert Parry for years acted as liaison between the program and Casey Raymond also drew charming doodles like this depicting himself as a literal puppeteer controlling many different strings >The organization was stacked with prominent neoconservatives like Lane Kirkland John Richardson and Allen Weinstein Carl Gershman a longtime professional anticommunist was its first and so far only president One of its current board members Elliott Abrams is a war criminal with a history of subverting democracy overseas >To prevent the odor of US imperialism from contaminating the NEDs work the Reagan administration made it a private organization that in turn funded several more private institutions including the NDI and IRI But the fact that it was routinely staffed with former US officials and got its funding from the US government has always made this a dubious conceit >Equally dubious was the idea that its task was simply to promote democracy Two of its "core grantees"  which receive around 70 percent of its funding  are explicitly right wing: the IRI which is a GOP-led institution that once described its goals as advancing "democracy the rule of law and free-market economics"; and the Center for International Private Enterprise a project of the **US Chamber of Commerce** Even the Solidarity Center (formerly the Free Trade Union Institute) which is affiliated with the **AFL-CIO** went on to support conservative causes Only the NDI the Democrats arm could be said to be anywhere left of center Overall the NEDs track record tilts decidedly to the right CIPE and The Solidarity Center are two of the four grantees of the [NED](https://wwwsolidaritycenterorg/national-endowment-for-democracy-ned-ndi-iri-cipe-and-solidarity-center-welcome-increased-funding-from-congress/) NED does what the CIA used to do behind closed doors I thought the NED was pretty interesting considering Time Magazines story about the secret shadow campaign to save the [2020 election](https://timecom/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/) The article mentions multiple times how the group was working to protect and save Democracy (democracy is used ~33 times in the article) The article also outlines an alliance that included the AFL-CIO and the US Chamber of Commerce: >The pact was formalized in a terse little-noticed joint statement of the US Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO published on Election Day This article from [socialismcom](https://socialismcom/fs-article/betrayal-from-venezuela-to-iraq-the-afl-cio-and-the-national-endowment-for-democracy/) discusses how NED is a CIA front is funded by the US government and works closely with the leaders of the AFL-CIO: >A little-known far-right organization with a warm and fuzzy name the National Endowment for Democracy is up to no good in at least 40 countries That is bad enough especially given that the money for NEDs dirty deeds comes from working taxpayers courtesy of the US Congress Truly appalling however is the role that leaders of the AFL-CIO the largest US labor federation play in carrying out the work of this agency > A CIA front is born During the late 1970s the CIA was exposed for its active sabotage of numerous governments and progressive labor movements abroad Not so publicized was the AFL-CIOs role in aiding the CIA >Operating through the American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD) the AFL-CIO aided the overthrow of democratically elected governments in Guyana in 1963 Brazil in 1964 the Dominican Republic in 1965 and Chile in 1973 These are just a few examples of labor officialdoms shameful record in helping to carry out corporate-propelled US foreign policy >In 1983 after the CIA was widely discredited Ronald Reagans administration created a new agency the NED to take care of old business As an NED founder Allen Weinstein put it in 1991: "A lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA" >In his hard-hitting book Rogue State: A Guide to the Worlds Only Superpower William Blum describes some of the agencys activities "NED successfully manipulated elections in Nicaragua in 1990 and Mongolia in 1996 helped to overthrow democratically elected governments in Bulgaria in 1990 and Albania in 1991 and 1992 and was busy working in Haiti in the late 1990s on behalf of rightwing groups **NED like the CIA before it calls what it does supporting democracy** The governments and movements whom the NED targets call it destabilization" From the [Time 2020 election story:](https://timecom/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/) >"The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation" says Norm Eisen >The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation >The system didnt work magically Democracy is not self-executing" >And they believe the public needs to understand the systems fragility in order to ensure that democracy in America endures,Settlemente,16187557890,1

gxactiw,n6w42q,There are 17 transnational companies at the top who control well over 42 trillion dollars in investments They have board members of around 200 people that make all the decisions for these companies and they set the financial policies for the world All of the billionaires multimillionaires and most of the millionaires are invested in these companies These people know each other or know of each other Theyre kids go to the same schools While they are competitive they also love money They have discovered that they can make unholy amounts of money not by competing but by working together They collaborate collude to price fix rig scam steal plunder and buy laws that enrich and protect them They use their combined interests in a thug/mafia/mercenary style use of the us army to force countries to bend to their will or else They fill all the important positions in the us government with their own people to further and protect their interests There are other transnational firms very large who also follow what they do They have more money then they know what to do with The problem they have is finding a safe investment with consistent and good returns because they own most everything already This has led them push for and to prolong wars one of the best and safest investment for long term profits This has also led them to take on riskier investments which has been wrecking the economy but they know the government will bail them out The lack of good places to invest has led them to start buying up public institutions for example they want to bankrupt the post office so they can privatize it They want to privatize government infrastructure and the military They are desperately trying to find new ways to bring profits but they have more money than worthwhile places to invest it Bezos gatesmusk and all the names you know are part of these institutions that control the financial system of nearly the entire planet They are not working for the betterment of mankind or for the people They control the us government and nearly all governments to their own enrichment while the names you know contribute to our problems they are not at the top of the power structure they have a voice and play a role in the ruination of lives and planet The real power structure are the transnational investment firms that represent the "combined rich" and decide whats bests for their investments and control both the governments and the laws This doesnt mean the rich cant/wont use their money/power but it means that the bigger power is not what a single billionaire is doing but what the combined group is doing together All billionaires and multi billionaires are heavily invested in at least one of these firms and most millionaires but not all are also invested Theyre business interests are interwoven with each other so trying to interfere or stop them you are not just taking on one of them but these firms have the resources of unimaginable wealth and power behind them They can not be stopped,34831,16204034560,1

The occult meaning for that: Not knowing the difference between right & wrong Police officers owners and they *do* have owners put that symbolism there intentionally as a form of mockery They put it directly around police officers brains Their owners laugh hysterically about this behind closed doors The problem is those who work in law enforcement have confused man-made law with actual justice (Natural Law) They dont see the difference - and there is an *enormous* difference They need an understanding of Natural Law and there is a lot of effort put forth to hide knowledge of Natural Law from the public Natural Law is logic-based and contains absolute truths about morality Man-made laws on the other hand involve people writing down that they have "authority" over others and then mind-controlling the public into believing that makes that authority real Of course it doesnt in reality But the reason things like Epsteins death are allowed to happen is because the people working in law enforcement simply do as theyre told by their higher-ups regardless of whether its actually right or wrong No real improvement will occur for humanity in terms of all these conspiracies until far more people begin understanding Natural Law and applying it to their actions instead of believing in the supposed "authority" of government Thats the root of the problem for *all* conspiracies - and the solution We are quickly running out of time to do this And the vast majority of people believe in the legitimacy of the authority of government right now That needs to change Were nowhere near where we need to be with not much time left Anyone reading this please help spread the word about Natural Law Look into it for yourself if you dont know about it,Law_of_1,16197586280,3

h67hnxn,opbmcz,IS ANYONE APOLOGIZING TO GARY WEBB? by Michael Levine (DEA-RET) Gary Webb just in case youve already forgotten him was the journalist who in a well researched understated article entitled "The Dark Alliance" linked the CIA supported Contras to cocaine and weapons being sold to a California street gang and ended up literally being hounded out of journalism by every mainstream news peddling organization in the Yellow Pages Even his own employer The San Jose Mercury piled on for the kill And guess what? The CIA finally admitted yesterday in the New York Times no less that they in fact did "work with" the Nicaraguan Contras while they had information that they were involved in cocaine trafficking to the United States An action known to us court qualified experts and federal agents as Conspiracy to Import and Distribute Cocainea federal felony punishable by up to life in prison To illustrate how us regular walking around non CIA types are treated when we violate this law while I was serving as a DEA supervisor in New York City I put two New York City police officers in a federal prison for Conspiracy to distribute Cocaine when they looked the other way at their friends drug dealing We could not prove they earned a nickel nor that they helped their friend in any way they merely did not do their duty by reporting him They were sentenced to 10 and 12 years respectively and one of them I was recently told had committed suicide I have spent three decades as a court qualified expert and federal agent and am not aware of any class of American Citizen having special permission to violate the law that we have been taxed over $1 trillion in the past two decades to enforce; the law that every politician bureaucrat and media pundit keeps telling us protects us against the most serious danger to American security in our historyThe interesting thing to me about the Webb article is that the CIA is provably (and now admittedly) responsible for much larger scale drug trafficking than Webb alleged or even imagined in his report In fact according to a confidential DEA report entitled "Operation Hun a Chronology" that I used as part of the proof to back up the undercover experiences detailed in my book The Big White Lie (optioned for a movie by Robert Greenwald Productions) the CIA was actively blocking DEA from indicting many members of the ruling government of Bolivia from 1980-83during a time period that these same people were responsible for producing more than 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States As CIA Inspector General Hitz himself stated before congress it was during this time period that Nicaraguan Contra supporters were buying large amounts of cocaine from these same CIA protected Bolivians Do you think Congress wants to see this proof? The gang that cant spy straight as they are known to my listeners and about whom President Lyndon Johnson once said "When Rich folks dont trust their sons with the family money they send them on down to the CIA" certainly did a lot more damage to this nation than for example computer company owner Will Foster who was sentenced to 93 years in prison for possession of 70 marijuana plants for medicinal use Of course true to their shifty sleazy form while admitting that they did aid and abet Contra drug trafficking they are now refusing to release their own final investigative report which details the damning proof The same report that CIA Inspector General Fredrick Hitz during February 1998 had promised congress and the American people was forthcoming "shortly" because as CIA Director George Tenet now claims CIA does not have enough money in its budget to properly classify it You believe that then I know an old guy with a beard named Fidel wandering the streets of South Miami with an Island about 90 miles off the coast for sale He says the money is for his retirement How you ask do they get away with it? Well for one thing mainstream media the so-called Fourth Estate does all it can to help During the Iran-contra hearings when Senators Kerry and Damato were making pronouncements before the Senate indicating that the CIA was involved with drug trafficking Katherine Graham the owner of The Washington Post addressed a class of CIA recruits at CIAs Langley headquarters in November 1988 by saying: "There are some things the general public does not need to know and shouldnt I believe democracy flourishes when the government can take legitimate steps to keep its secrets and when the press can decide whether to print what it knows" Apparently CIA protection of drug trafficking was among those secrets Thus it should have been no surprise to those CIA agent recruits when Washington Post reporter and drug expert Michael Itsikoff wrote that there was "no credible evidence" linking the CIA supported contras to cocaine trafficking at the same time very credible evidence was being heard by Senator Kerrys committee indicating that the Contras may have been the top purveyors of drugs to Americans in our historyNeither should it have been a surprise to anyone who heard her statement when mainstream media refused to print the news that Oliver North US Ambassador to Costa Rica Lewis Tambs and various top level CIA officers were banned from ever entering Costa Rica by Nobel Prize winning President Oscar Arias for drug running The drugs by the way all going to us Nor should it have been a surprise when Gary Webb was destroyed by mainstream media for doing nothing more or less than telling the truth as he found it And now while CIA admits their felonies to the press but refuses to release the proof and Janet Reno the head of the Obstruction of Justice Department has done the unprecedented by classifying her own departments investigation into CIA drug trafficking the partnership for a Drug Free America is spending $2 billion of our tax money on already-proven-fruitless anti-drug ads And where do you think the money goes? Answer: to every major media corporation on the big board Gary Webb my friend you are owed a huge apology But I doubt that youll get it Not in this lifetime,shylock92008,16270105150,2

h6724ku,opbmcz,From 1982 to 1995 the CIA did not to have to report if they suspected any of their agents of dealing drugs Why? Its the kind of government exchange you assume never actually takes place But it did And it went something like this: CIA Chief: Dear Attorney General Do you mind if CIA agents or informants are dealing drugs? I mean we dont have to tell on them do we? Attorney General: Of course not! Well you did But I just changed the law Dont worry about it CIA Chief: Gee thanks! This may sound absurd but according to a series of recently declassified documents obtained by the MoJo Wire its just what happened in the spring of 1982 Letter From Bill Casey To William French Smith https://webarchiveorg/web/20070613130342/https://wwwciagov/library/reports/general-reports-1/cocaine/contra-story/01gif Letter From William French Smith to Bill Casey https://webarchiveorg/web/20070613154234/https://wwwciagov/library/reports/general-reports-1/cocaine/contra-story/02gif Letter from the DOJ Codifying the MOU https://webarchiveorg/web/20070613051429/https://wwwciagov/library/reports/general-reports-1/cocaine/contra-story/14gif Central Intelligence Agency Director William Caseys request to then-Attorney General William French Smith isnt in the public domain But two letters one from Smith thanking Casey for his request and a follow-up by Casey are both available They were released as part of a internal CIA report that explored allegations of CIA involvement in drug trafficking (The most comprehensive allegations were reported by Gary Webb in a series of San Jose Mercury News reports and a book entitled "Dark Alliance") In the first document Smith thanks Casey for his letter (the one that isnt public) and says: "in view of the fine cooperation the Drug Enforcement Administration has received from CIA no formal requirement regarding the reporting of narcotics violations has been included in these procedures"--William French SmithAttorney General Casey in return thanks the Attorney General for his understanding: "I am pleased that these procedures which I believe strike the proper balance between enforcement of the law and protection of intelligence sources and methods will now be forwarded to other agencies"--William J CaseyDirector Central Intelligence Agency\[See the full document\] The two men then codified their agreement in a Memorandum of Understanding According to the agreement intelligence agencies would not have to report if any of their agents were involved in drug running (By agents the agreement meant CIA sources and informants Full-time employees still couldnt deal drugs) That understanding remained in effect until August of 1995 when current Attorney General Janet Reno rescinded the agreement Its reasonable that the CIA be allowed to keep its mouth shut if it knows that some of its agents are involved in minor illegal affairs Presumably some of the value of informants comes from the fact that they keep company with shady characters who engage in unlawful activities But why would the CIA ask to be exempt specifically from drug enforcement laws? According to Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif) who is calling for full disclosure of the facts "The CIA knew that the Contras were dealing drugs They made this deal with the Attorney General to protect themselves from having to report it" Some of the remaining questions may still be answered The Department of Justice and the CIA have finished separate investigations into possible CIA involvement in drug smuggling But neither report has been made available to the public; the Justice department cites an "ongoing investigation" while the CIA says their report is an internal document and therefore classified Says Congresswoman Waters: "What is it they dont want Americans to see?

h674p5o,opbmcz,1998: CIA Says It Used Nicaraguan Rebels Accused of Drug Tie; By James Risen July 17 1998 ; "The agencys decision to keep those paid agents or to continue dealing with them in some less formal relationship was made by top officials at headquarters in Langley Va" - NYT  https://wwwnytimescom/1998/07/17/world/cia-says-it-used-nicaraguan-rebels-accused-of-drug-tiehtml CIA Says It Used Nicaraguan Rebels Accused of Drug Tie By James Risen July 17 1998 The Central Intelligence Agency continued to work with about two dozen Nicaraguan rebels and their supporters during the 1980s despite allegations that they were trafficking in drugs according to a classified study by the CIA The new study has found that the agencys decision to keep those paid agents or to continue dealing with them in some less formal relationship was made by top officials at headquarters in Langley Va in the midst of the war waged by the CIA-backed contras against Nicaraguas leftist Sandinista Government The new report by the CIAs inspector general criticizes agency officials actions at the time for the inconsistent and sometimes sloppy manner in which they investigated -- or chose not to investigate -- the allegations which were never substantiated by the agency The inspector generals report which has not yet been publicly released also concludes that there is no evidence that any CIA officials were involved in drug trafficking with contra figures The fundamental finding of the report is that there is no information that the CIA or CIA employees ever conspired with any contra organizations or individuals involved with the contras for purposes of drug trafficking a United States intelligence official said The new report is the long-delayed second volume of the CIAs internal investigation into possible connections between the contras and Central American drug traffickers The investigation was originally prompted by a 1996 series in The San Jose Mercury-News which asserted that a dark alliance between the CIA the contras and drug traffickers had helped finance the contra war with profits from drug smuggling The second volume dismisses those specific charges as did the first volume released in January The series charged that the alliance created a drug trafficking network that introduced crack cocaine into South Central Los Angeles It prompted an enormous outcry especially among blacks many of whom said they saw it as confirmation of a Government-backed conspiracy to keep blacks dependent and impoverished The Mercury-News subsequently admitted that the series was flawed and reassigned the reporter In the declassified version of the CIAs first volume the agency said the Mercury-News charges were baseless and mentioned drug dealers who had nothing to do with the CIA But John M Deutch the Director of Central Intelligence at the time had also asked the inspector general to conduct a broader inquiry to answer unresolved questions about the contra program and drug trafficking that had not been raised by The Mercury-News Frederick Hitz then the CIAs inspector general decided to issue a second larger report to deal with those broader issues Many allegations in the second volume track closely with charges that first surfaced in a 1987 Senate investigation The CIA is reluctant to release the complete 500-page second volume because it deals directly with contras the agency did work with According to the report CIA officials involved in the contra program were so focused on the fight against the Sandinistas that they gave relatively low priority to collecting information about the possible drug involvement of contra rebels The report concluded that CIA officers did report on drug trafficking by the contras but that there were no clear guidelines given to field officers about how intensively they should investigate or act upon the allegations In all the CIA received allegations of drug involvement against about 50 contras or supporters during the war against the Sandinistas the report said Some of the allegations may have been specious the result of Sandinista propaganda American intelligence officials said It could not be determined from the CIAs records how many of the 50 cases were fully investigated But the agency continued to work with about two dozen of the 50 contras according to American intelligence officials familiar with the report They said the report had found that the agency was unable to either prove or disprove the charges or did not investigate them adequately American intelligence officials who provided information about the report declined to identify the individual contras who were the subjects of the drug allegations But they did say that in addition to individual cases the report found that drug allegations had been made against one contra organization a group known as 15th of September That group was formed in 1980 and was disbanded in January 1982 The CIAs decision to classify this second volume has already been met with criticism in Congress Senator John Kerry Democrat of Massachusetts who led a 1987 Congressional inquiry into allegations of contra drug connections wrote a letter Thursday to the Director of Central Intelligence George J Tenet asking that the report be immediately declassified Mr Kerry who has reviewed the second volume of the inspector generals report said he believed that CIA officials involved in the contra program did not make a serious effort to fully investigate the allegations of drug involvement by the contras Some of us in Congress at the time in 1985 1986 were calling for a serious investigation of the charges and CIA officials did not join in that effort Mr Kerry said There was a significant amount of stonewalling Im afraid that what I read in the report documents the degree to which there was a lack of interest in making sure the laws were being upheld A version of this article appears in print on July 17 1998 Section A Page 2 of the National edition

I t is now clear that this agreement began with the events described in THE BIG WHITE LIE; that the top drug traffickers in Bolivia then supplying virtually all the worlds cocaine-including Sonia Atala-were CIA assets that had to be protected from our deep cover probe Laura and I still have the proof of this that we used to back up the publication THE BIG WHITE LIE The same proof was later incorporated into other data backing up the publications of DEEP COVER and TRIANGLE OF DEATH [https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/](https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/) Our evidence-which congress has been craning its neck not to see- for instance shows clearly that during Operation Hun (the story in The Big White Lie) secret meetings were held with CIA and Justice Department wherein all indictments of top government officials in Bolivia were blocked We now believe this agreement began because of Operation Hun CIA had to hide the fact that they were supporting the people manufacturing virtually all the cocaine being produced in the world at that time In Deep Cover we showed that during Operation Trifecta-a highly successful deep cover probe into the top of the drug world in three countries (Panama Bolivia and Mexico) -Attorney General of the US Ed Meese found it necessary to warn the Attorney General of Mexico about DEAs case We (undercover DEA agents and Customs agents) found links between top US government officials and the people who murdered DEA agent Kiki Camarena that to this day go unexamined by our congress or anyone else In "TRIANGLE OF DEATH a work of "faction" we showed CIAs real-life involvement in the protection and creation of one of the most murderous criminal organizations to ever plague America an organization created by escaped Nazi fugitives under CIA protection-events occurring long before this alleged CIA Justice agreement And so the dance continues If anyone watched the CNN show you cannot have helped but notice the snickering on the part of Congressional chairman Porter Goss (an ex CIA officer) as congresswoman Maxine Waters spoke Now heres the reason why: Sources of mine who speak to me from inside this veil of secrecy out of conscience and because I am cheaper and more reliable than a psychiatrist have already told me the following: There is secret communication between CIA and members of the Congressional staff-one must keep in mind that Porter Goss the chairman is an ex CIA official- indicating that the whole hearing is just a smoke and mirror show so that the American people-particularly the Black community- can "blow off some steam" without doing any damage to CIA The CIA has been assured that nothing real will be done other than some embarrassing questions being asked That the hearings will result in the CIA receiving even a larger budget than the current $26 billion that they admit to One of the most distressing things for me a 25 year veteran of this business to listen to was when Congresswoman Waters said that the hearings were not about CIA officers being indicted and going to jail "That is not going to happen" she said Almost in the same breath she spoke of a recent case in Miami wherein a Venezuelan National Guard general was caught by Customs agents smuggling more than a ton of cocaine into the US Despite named CIA officers being involved in the plot as Congresswoman Waters stated the Justice Department will not tell her anything about the case because of "secrecy laws" No wonder chairman Goss was snickering She could not have played more neatly into CIA hands than to surrender before the battle was engaged For the entire existence of CIA they have gotten away with doing more damage to the American people than all our traditional enemies combined precisely because no one was ever prosecuted From the CIA protection of Nazi criminals from war crimes prosecution as they set up criminal organizations that preyed on America (Triangle of Death) to their lies to President Kennedy that dragged us into Bay of Pigs to their lies to President Johnson that dragged us into the Vietnam War to their creation of a pan Arab army of American hating drug trafficking terrorists during the Afghan War to the Church Commission hearings to MK-Ultra to the Bolivian Cocaine Coup ("The Big White Lie") to their protection of the worlds top cocaine traffickers as they laid waste to American streets (Deep cover) the CIA has acted exactly as Senator Frank Church once described them: "a runaway rogue elephantcompletely unresponsive to Congressthey (the CIA) have not only been unproductive they have been contra productive they have brought great shame on America" And the dance continues &#x200B;

hrfghyd,rwkj3w,The worst is yet to come My religion (Orthodox) had prophecies about this and so far around 8-9 of them came true (theres more but they are some smaller ones so I wouldnt mention them) The one that is yet to come true is the one saying "once the humanity is at the point of not knowing what to do as times are getting worse and no solutions are to be found antichrist will appear with a solution" (I tried to translate it as best as I could) Vaccines are proving as failing which is exactly what they want The time will come when they will say publicly that they no longer know what to do and how to deal with the pandemic Thats when a *certain person* will appear with a "solution" to end all problems and he will be throned in UN as the humanitys saviour I made this as brief as I could as it is rather complex and in order to truly understand and believe all this youd need to know a lot of backstory Another huge one said that "there will be a global pandemic before the end" (This one was told about 200-300 years ago iirc) We live in the end times sadly You may or may not believe me but Ive been following advices that my religion told me due to these prophecies and I havent regretted a single decision I made thus far Ive simply been following prophecies and what they tell us to do and Im making it work Havent and wont take the vax as I know what it is leading towards,HRCK0,16414291920,2

We literally have satellites that can confirm identities indoors surveillance tech to collect data from all local cell phones a la Nolan Batman and can subpoena any tech company for their gathered data on pretty much everything else about your life if you carry a cell phone And yet 200 days later and the best they can do is hold a political trial in Congress Which is just judicial theater pulling on the heartstrings of voters and the wallets of corporate interests We didnt give bin Laden or McVeigh the luxury of hiding behind public perception I will NOT advocate for the same treatment to insurrectionists at this time but its hard to support this egregious lack of any action in a country where we have already had to sacrifice so much in the name of fasci I mean law and order,50kent,16274396460,1

h7cho06,ovpxdj,According to the research being done especially in places like Israel that has a population over 60 at 80% vaccinated by February data is showing the vaccine effectiveness is fading quick and dramatically Had you been vaccinated in January such as myself youll find youre at best walking around with an effectiveness of nearly 20% compared to someone vaccinated in June who is around 80% If unvaccinated people are the only ones getting sick the concern we are seeing wouldnt be there You would be protected with your vaccination and would have little to worry about The truth is we will see more variants and until we have boosters available and ones that can be made quickly before the new variants take hold we will continue to see spikes regardless of previous vaccinations Instead we are seeing vaccinated people spreading the virus and some knowingly I know first hand someone who is currently infected after being vaccinated in april and she continues to work at her job since the symptoms arent bad according to her and she is vaccinated The anti vaxxers are a problem but theyre a distraction from the real issue that your vaccine will only provide so much protection and its not a ticket to do whatever you want If the vaccine worked effectively for the current delta variant they would only be their own problem Kind of like driving a car with a seatbelt The direct impact is only to the individual I have and still continue to wear two masks including an n95 as well as limit my public interactions It isnt hard to wear a mask its not hard to use common sense even if youre vaccinated Weve had a hospital in my metropolitan area that had 20% of the admitted covid patients fully vaccinated It all depends on when your state started doing vaccines and how long ago it had been since you got yours And we will see a lot more of these so called "breakthrough" cases regardless of vaccination rates And government officials have been warned already of this and the CDC has discussed this internally and a lot of people are concerned about the effectiveness of the vaccines The mask mandate should have never been removed and local governments have also failed their constituents,mrnight8,16278464230,1

Masked 100% in school this fall - no option Its bullshit If you are a family that has a little one then wear your masks If I had a child under 12 my entire family would be masked right now anywhere indoors today - despite currently miniscule numbers However we dont so I dont feel its necessary to do so I wont raise a stink about masking rules that businesses want to put in place but unlike last year when I supported every single one of these mandatesthis year is different,islander1,16278483180,1

I get this isnt great for personal liberties (though we use to require people to show immunization records to get into school or enter the country) and we should keep an eye on the government so that things dont stick past the pandemic (like with the NSA and their anti-terrorism measures) but like most people I take this pandemic seriously and just want it to be over I dont believe in forcing people to take the shot with force (unless the virus was more deadly and Martial Law was declared) but restricting them from public places is good encouragement and helps keep immuno-compromised people and others who cant get vaccinated for medical reasons safe,Beeker93,16278566340,1

gyd6qgd,ndkvik,Its too early for masks off in public indoors We should wait until 1 There has been enough time for everyone who wants the vaccine to be FULLY vaccinated including in blue areas where appointments have been less available Many age groups have only been recently eligible in some states Also dont forget people without car access need more time 2 At least 50% of the total population is FULLY vaccinated (that means a full 6 weeks after first dose) 3 Ideally until cases are down but if idiots stop us from achieving that this summer we can at least keep masks on until the only people left 12 or older and not FULLY vaccinated are TRULY just the anti-vaxxers 4 The most ideal of all would be for most people to keep wearing masks indoors in public until fall so the 2-11 age group could be included This would also crush the case numbers even more Obviously its fine for fully vaccinated people to have private unmasked indoor parties but in public a lot of lying unmasked people just means that people still waiting for their appointments and partially vaccinated people are now forced to stay at home even more than before or may be in an unsafe environment at work Because other peoples masks protect you more than your own mask And there are definitely going to be some people who stop wearing a mask just because no one else is wearing masks or because someone is harassing them for still wearing a mask,kittey257,16211982160,2

guotxn9,mrcrm8,There was a good article somewhere about how to assess these risks at a more personal level Like the chances of bad outcomes from these things varies with stuff like age and certain pre-existing conditions along with the general community transmission rates of covid So for this headline here you would need to compare also "what are my chances of getting covid *at all*?" against the choice of vaccine If the chances of getting covid are very very low (maybe you live on an island off NZ or something) then it might make sense to avoid AstraZeneca since in your circumstances your chances of having *any* negative outcome from covid are very very very low compared with a very very low chance of negative outcome from AstraZeneca At the public health level different countries have already taken different reactions based on their particular circumstances For instance if you have a fairly dense population and are high income country and have access to something like the BioNTech vaccine then you might take the approach of abandoning AstraZeneca entirely If you are at the other extreme low income poorly developed health infrastructure lots of people long travel times from population centres you probably will press ahead with AstraZeneca and similar vaccines because of its advantages and accept that you will have some small number of complications or deaths because it is far smaller number of deaths from the much slower more expensive difficult roll out of different vaccines,FartHeadTony,16185472640,1

Im really sick of it Especially the disappointment that my family and I got our two doses of Pfizer shot and because of everything else we cant feel 100% safe from Covid Weve done our part and gotten vaccinatedcan barely wait to get a third doseand still read that vaccinated people die from this stupid virus! Regardless of your personal feelings its a public health crisisthere are way too many news articles about dying unvaccinated people saying they wish theyd gotten vaccinated Even if you think its stupid get it and be a hero for the greater good I think another worry is Bidens mental stateas in is he mentally competent?

hpjxe0s,rm4ymn,**Omicron Has 80% Lower Risk of Hospitalization New Study Shows** * Once admitted risk of severe disease is the same: NICD data * Compared to delta odds of severe omicron disease is 70% lower South Africans contracting Covid-19 in the current fourth wave of infections are 80% less likely to be hospitalized if they catch the omicron variant compared with other strains according to a study released by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases Once admitted to the hospital the risk of severe disease doesnt differ from other variants the authors led by scientists Nicole Walter and Cheryl Cohen said Compared to delta infections in South Africa between April and November omicron infections are associated with a 70% lower risk of severe disease they said The omicron data was collected for the two months through November Since being identified by South African scientists on Nov 25 the omicron variant has fueled record case numbers across the country Africas most developed economy has fully inoculated about 44% of its adult population over a seven-month period &#x200B; In the data that are being submitted to a preprint medical publication -- MedRxiv -- the authors adjusted for various confounding factors that could influence the results including age gender and whether the cases were known reinfections For severity of disease after admission they also adjusted for the presence of other illnesses and prior immunization The study also showed that those with omicron may have higher viral loads The study is "important" though its use of so-called historic controls when comparing to the delta infections between April and November means its outcome may be biased by time issues said Paul Hunter a professor of medicine at the UKs University of East Anglia "So even though cases of omicron were less likely to end up in hospital than cases of delta it is not possible to say whether this is due to inherent differences in virulence or whether this is due to higher population immunity in November compared to earlier in the year" Hunter said The authors flagged the same limitations,b3atballs,16401793260,233

gy1tg8l,nbi105,I would ideally err on the side of caution and disagree with the statement by Dr Fauci because of following (I know I might get downvoted but as someone who belongs to a family of doctors including medical researchers I would like to put in my 2 cents): 1) Masks are not only supposed to prevent you from getting infected but also prevent your mucus/ nose droplets from going out when you sneeze It has been a proven fact that it is more critical for an infected person to wear a mask than a healthy person who needs protection Moreover it has been proven that fully vaccinated people can still be asymptomatic carriers of the disease So there is a chance if vaccinated people do not wear mask in public places they might end up spreading droplets and infecting people given they are asymptomatic 2) There is a potential that this will encourage a lot of non vaccinated people to stop wearing masks in public by falsely claiming they are vaccinated I am not saying that everyone will do it but even a minor section does it it might break havoc especially as some of the new variants are highly infectious 3) Look at countries who have really done well in controlling numbers eg Singapore Apart from very effecting tracing and isolation measures mandatory masks at all public places except while doing intensive exercises (ie running in a park/ or road gyms get closed the moment cases shoot up) is one of the key factors which has limited transmission in workplaces malls beaches etc Again I do not mean to undermine his statement as he is a very learner doctor but just highlight some of the possible downsides Peace,TowardsFitness,16209563140,-2

gzw0xq0,nniy3y,Not necessarily employers but heres a fun read about this type of stuff Real Life Example: Massachusetts Mandates A Vaccine In Jacobson v Massachusetts (1905) Mr Jacobsen refused to obey a law requiring that everyone in Cambridge receive a smallpox vaccination At the time a smallpox epidemic was raging Jacobson faced a fine or imprisonment if he failed to take the vaccine Jacobsen argued that forcing him to get the vaccine violated his fundamental liberty which included freedom to control his own body The State argued that the health risk was urgent that widespread vaccination was needed to protect everyone against smallpox and that any harm to individual liberty was a price worth paying given the severe threat of smallpox The Supreme Court acknowledged that both sides had a point On one hand the Court noted that "when faced with a society-threatening epidemic a state may implement emergency measures that curtail constitutional rights so long as the measures have at least some "real or substantial relation" to the public health crisis "On the other hand the Court recognized Jacobsens argument and agreed that the vaccine order did impact liberty and personal freedom The court cautioned that "a law purporting to protect public health may nevertheless be invalid if it "has no real or substantial relation to those objects or is beyond all question a plain palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law" In short while the court balanced the two competing concernsliberty and public safetythe court came down squarely in favor of public safety holding the vaccine order was valid given the seriousness of the threat The Court said that "the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States does not import an absolute right in each person to be at all times and in all circumstances wholly freed from restraint" But the Court also warned that any if a law goes too far in restricting liberty if the law is in place for too long or reaches too far or if the goal of the law can be achieved by less invasive measures then the court may well strike down the law,LazyKidd420,16223088990,1

ha04grb,p9dd93,This is something I suggested to my company in the UK: Hi folks Ive given some consideration to this and would like to suggest the below rules to satisfy a flexible work offering to the SD: I have based this on: 23 SD staff (8x 24/7 engineers 15x Core shift) Image Image Image Each engineer must come in 40% of their time Each day there must be at least 5 people physically on rotad shift Each day there must be no more than 10 engineer on schedule We split the WFH days in any given week between a choice of Monday+Tuesday or Thursday+Friday This grants opportunity of "extended weekend feeling" to all Q: Why 40% submission to physical occupation? A: TeamLead stated Service Desk requires an obligatory 15% physical office presence on any working day Q: How does this impact skill availability? A: It doesnt this is based purely on resource as we have availability across core teams in the working week On average we will have 8 engineers physically within the office space Q: How this is managed? A: Either by a scheduling app/portal where engineers self-sign up (first come first serve) and commit to fulfilling their weekly hours or assigned by TLs Q: How does this solution address 24/7 flexibility? A: Whilst 24/7 day shift must attend the office space 24/7 night shift fulfil duties from home Any 24/7 day shift falling on a weekend is fulfilled from home This is open to your adjustments or leave as is in the pot for discussion and practical application for the business Thanks" Glad to say this has now been adopted  Before COVID happened my company was on target to turn 200m so they purchased a new HQ for 15m We are an IT Managed Service Provider The company had plans to go global looking for offices in the USA They signed the contract grace period passed and then COVID happened They were unable to back out of the deal and have since been working within regulations of UK lockdowns and government guidance to continue with the new head office plan We have lost only 1 employee during this pandemic and that was after he contracted Covid after major surgery Work load has increased the employment demand at our company due to demand from clients working remotely and other IT projects Due to Covid theyve put the expansion on the back burner for now and are cautiously monitoring markets and of course Covid itself They still want to expand to the US Fingers crossed!  As we have hospitals and government clients for technical support we were actually classed as support workers and got full 80% furlough offered but we didnt need to take it Covid has just sped up the work from home culture and those that do not change their ways are set to lose good employees Mental health has been cited as one of the major drivers with a large majority of workers being effected I personally have been wfh social distancing and wearing a mask in public since 2019 when my wife started chemotherapy after a mastectomy So this has been the norm for us long before Covid came along I do think there is a need for a physical space a lot of clients say the office is a place to separate home and work life Ive never had this as an issue in fact I am blessed that I have seen my son grow up since his birth in 2019 I get to spend time playing with him look after my wife and be home "on time" or work late if I want to An hour here and there longer doesnt kill me in fact I believe I start earlier and finish on time or happy to work later I think sales people need that physical connection and banter with their colleagues its the nature of that beast I know from a lot of clients and other companies I interviewed for that WFH was a massive positive to performance and output but over time people have got complacent or lazy and now efficiency is actually on the back slide WFH is definitely here to stay to what degree and capacity offered is another thing Ps feel free to use my wfh flexible working plan ,PrimarisBA,16296996010,1

h9pnz04,p8e6s6,"The Food and Drug Administration is pushing to approve Pfizer-BioNTechs two-dose Covid-19 vaccine on Monday further expediting an earlier timeline for licensing the shot according to people familiar with the agencys planning Regulators were working to finish the process by Friday but were still working through a substantial amount of paperwork and negotiation with the company The people familiar with the planning who were not authorized to speak publicly about it cautioned that the approval might slide beyond Monday if some components of the review need more time An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment The agency had recently set an unofficial deadline for approval of around Labor Day The approval is expected to pave the way for a series of vaccination requirements by public and private organizations who were awaiting firmer regulatory backing before implementing mandates Federal and state health officials are also hoping that an approved vaccine will draw interest from some Americans who have been hesitant to take one that was only authorized for emergency use a phenomenon suggested by recent polling Some universities and hospitals are expected to mandate inoculation once a vaccine is fully approved The Pentagon earlier this month said it plans to make Covid vaccinations mandatory for the countrys 13 million active-duty troops "no later" than the middle of next month or sooner if the FDA acts earlier The timing of the approval could result in an uncomfortable messaging problem for the Biden administration which on Wednesday announced that fully vaccinated people should prepare to get booster shots eight months after they received second doses Approving the vaccine and encouraging boosters at the same time may suggest to some that the vaccine as licensed is inadequate without an extra shot The FDA last week updated its authorizations of Pfizer-BioNTechs and Modernas vaccine to allow third doses for some immunocompromised people a decision backed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Regulators are still reviewing Modernas application for full approval for its coronavirus vaccine and a decision could come at least several weeks after the one for Pfizer-BioNTech",urbanpencil,16294944330,203

h1qm10z,nzm2oo,Folks - this is how science works Even if the results seem trivial and logical scientists just do not assume the conclusions without evidence Based on clinical trials 1/2/3 the scientists ascertained safety efficacy at certain scale Now we are learning that the vaccines are effective in real life situations Thats why the public health guidance from the government may be delayed a bit compared to some of the common sense guidance that some experts recommend - the government is in the business to balance both science and common sense to provide the guidance that can protect the public,xilcilus,16236839630,116

hqf6iaj,rr7div,More than likely there are people at your job who are asymptomatic and have the virus unless of course each job has the ability to test employees daily (they dont) At some point people just have to accept that every public setting you go to has the potential for community spread regardless of the safety measures people take Theres going to be at least one person in every place you go who has COVID All of this is boiling down to your own personal risk tolerance at this point Were past the point where avoiding infection should be the primary goal All of that was fucked up last year when we could have significantly limited infection,NineteenAD9,16407931510,5
hqg0acr,rr7div,It seems SO likely that everyone will get Omicron the way its being talked about in the media I consume Previous infection wont prevent it Vaccinations wont prevent it Boosters wont prevent it (Ive had all those) Cloth masks wont prevent it Disposable surgical masks wont prevent it Unless you and everyone you live with can stay home and isolated from the public for several weeks which VERY few people can do Im led to believe well just all get it It almost seems futile to even try to avoid it Why avoid a fun NYE party to prevent infection when Im going to get it anyway from the grocery from work or from my kids bringing it home from school? All this "cancel the fun but keep the economy going and keep the kids in school" just doesnt make sense for a variant thats so infectious,CleverAmbrosia,16408047290,2
hqer8li,rr7div,It would be irresponsible to not say this as the public message But it ultimately comes down to each person to make their own risk determination If youre boosted and will be around only other boosted people risk is pretty low I wouldnt want to spend my NYE in a bar full of people though,marxbro4521,16407861400,12
hqi24t1,rr7div,Sorry Ive been *fine* with the past year and a half of lockdowns and restrictions because OG COVID and Delta were no joke but Omicron? People are getting their boosters From what I understand (correct me if Im wrong) its more infectious but less severe The only way new restrictions make sense is if Omicron has the potential to overwhelm our healthcare like Delta did over the summer but isnt that less likely this time around? The messaging throughout this pandemic has been shit even when Ive been "on board" with it At some point these leaders are going to have to pull their heads out of their asses and let us get on with our lives Mandate masks in public and encourage social distancing sure but beyond that dont let businesses reopen if youre just going to beg workers to spend all our remaining time at home So dumb,LettuceBeGrateful,16408352530,1

hrvcv1x,ryzbou,Why did the CDC mislead us the WHO guidance indicates to wear masks around others outside your household indoors if there isnt ventilation So many people genuinely dont want covid got vaccinated wear masks in public listened word for word to the CDC and now are very ill with covid because they genuinely thought theyd be ok around other vaccinated family and friendswhen the reality is with omicron you may very well get the virus Its not March 2020 but its so awful,trick-buffer,16417009140,1

ha8jhii,pamuzn,Simple fact if the matter is that coronavirus is not going away Its never going away Were going to need to figure out how to live with it Every person (barring medically unable) aged 12+ in the US has had the ability to get a vaccine which are incredibly effective at preventing serious illness and/or death Delta variant is super super transmissible Get the vaccine or get Covid (or sometimes both - if you are vaccinated incredibly rare to get seriously ill though) Your choice Lets go about our business accordingly Also since the onset of the pandemic there have been less than 400 children (anyone under the age of 18) who died of Covid in the US which is less than half of the number that have died of pneumonia There are more than 70 million children in the US The chance of Covid killing a child are exceedingly rare Lets all put on our big boy big girl or big whatever gender you identify as pants calculate the risk and make the most of life We cannot continue to live afraid We cannot continue to stay home and shelter in place We cannot continue to hold our kids home from school indefinitely Lets use our individual liberties and freedom and do what is best for ourselves and for our families This is no longer a public health crisis - ERs that are filling can be easily remedied with more vaccines in more peoples arms Its time to unite time to respect the decisions of others and the consequences of those decisions time to live life,JP_In_The_513,16298542010,8

hmrq413,r5ueps,I dont see an English option (on mobile page) so I ran the article through Google translate: Preliminary data: The vaccine protects highly effectively against the new variant Marciano Foundation The information received in Israel about the Omicron - the good and bad news: After Bennetts declaration of "state of emergency" in Israel tonight received preliminary data - both from South Africa and Europe - on the new variant that is causing concern around the world The data revealed tonight (Tuesday) in the "main edition" shortly after being received in Israel are preliminary - but indicate that the vaccine is still effective against the newly discovered mutations The data were collected in both South Africa and European countries where verifications were found in the new variant It should be emphasized that these are preliminary data that the whole world is waiting for and at this point they become the working assumption According to these data the effectiveness of the vaccine (for those who received three doses ie also the booster) decreases only slightly: 90% protection compared to 95% protection against the Delta strain These are impressive and somewhat reassuring figures The effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing serious illness for those who have been vaccinated three times is the same as the effectiveness against the Delta strain - the strain that has been the most dominant in Israel so far The alarming data But not everything is rosy: the problems start with the risk of recovering from being infected The data show that the risk of recovering from infection is twice as high as in Delta and the rate of infection is 13 times higher than in Delta This rate of infection is very high: in South Africa there is talk that in 15 days the number of patients has increased 15 times Although the numbers are low the rate is problematic and worrying: in Israel there are many Israelis who are not vaccinated Another worrying statistic has been revealed regarding the unvaccinated: their risk of becoming seriously ill is 24 times that of the original strain of the corona the one that arrived in Israel nearly two years ago In "unvaccinated" the reference is also to those vaccinated in two doses who are entitled to a booster and have not yet been vaccinated and therefore their protection is insufficient Despite this news the data is a reassuring siren when it comes to protecting vaccinated people from both serious illness and infection for further reading: South Africa to Israel: "Vaccine effective against Omicron variant" The Omicron variant captured the continent of Europe unprepared A new variant has been identified in Africa Will Ben Gurion Airport close because of the new variant? The Corona Cabinet approved: Insulation for returnees from abroad African variant Omicron (Photo: Reuters) South Africa has transferred new information to Israel - and this is the data | Photo: Reuters The contradictory messages of vaccine manufacturers The test of the effectiveness of existing vaccines against the new variant was in its infancy but Modern CEO Stefan Bensel managed to arouse global concern today when he said in an interview with the Financial Times that he expects a significant decrease in vaccine efficacy But Bensel spoke of a decline in benefit from a disease with symptoms rather than a serious illness - a difference that is known to be dramatic in corona contexts as Pfizer CEO Albert Burla was apt to describe: Defense compared to Delta but that would be the limit In both cases the booster vaccines are expected to reduce the gap dramatically " Burla who promised to know more about the benefits of the vaccine against the variant in about a week and a half said Pfizer had already begun developing a specific vaccine against the variant a few days ago "We know the genetic linkage of the virus we have it - thats how it starts" he explained "We started at risk to produce a vaccine We actually started on Friday to produce a vaccine based on the flooring the DNA template that would allow us to make RNA that would eventually women within that vaccine" Israel meanwhile is waiting for a more categorical statement from the two CEOs and meanwhile relies on data coming from South Africa - where the variant was first discovered - and from which it appears that the omicron is more contagious but is no more violent "Data on the benefits of the vaccine - there may be some partial data from South Africa" Dr Sharon Elrai-Price head of public health services said today during a debate in the Knesset I know they are doing the lab tests as I described to see how useful the vaccine against this variant is " Bennett worried: "There is a lot of uncertainty" Albert Burla and Naftali Bennett (Adapted by Reuters) Burla optimistic Bennett explains why he activated the GSS | Arrangement: Reuters At the same time the government is today approving a memorandum of law that will allow it to extend the decision to allow the GSS to verify the cellular devices of those infected with Omicron or the suspects who were infected with it with high probability - in order to interrupt the transmission chains as quickly as possible But just before the move reaches the Knesset the coalition itself is sharply critical of the law Prime Minister Bennett - who saw for himself how in the ministers WhatsApp groups Ministers Saar Shasha-Bitton Barbibai and Avidar voted against - told today why Israel decided to include the GSS in the campaign despite and perhaps because it is a low number of infected "There is a lot of uncertainty and that is why we are taking these extreme measures" he said in a video call with Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schlenberg "But our advantage as leaders is that once we know more when there is more information - we can let go of those measures gradually" As for the restrictions at Ben Gurion Airport the prime minister has already decided that these will last about two weeks from the date of the decision - and only if the final proof does come that the variant does not endanger the populations immunity or the omicron is already spread in the community - these restrictions will be removed Yaron Avraham participated in the preparation of the article,Serenity101,16383425550,2

hnflckn,r9otza,Ive been teaching in China for 18 years and this is par for the course Ill first say Ive always worked in the private sector and there have been times that Ive been outsourced to public schools on occasion while working with a few schools in the past What a gong show Not criticizing China Just humanity in general So I came **right** after the WHO lifted the SARS travel ban to China Id planned on moving to China earlier and SARS ended up delaying my departure by a few months There are always sick kids coming to school It really broke my heart Id see kids as young as 4 years old coming to class run down and sick It just made me think "if youre going to run your kid into the ground like this at this age what kind of physical condition can you expect them to be in when theyre 30?" When H1N1 was a thing I was working 3 afternoons a week at a high school and DAMN I had classes where students were constantly going to the bathroom to puke their guts out 1/4-1/3 of the students were clearly effected I constantly encouraged them to go home but they didnt see it as an option because their teachers and parents didnt accept the practice of saying home to get better and not risk spreading their illness to others A few years later I had a kid come to school looking kinda sick and before class I asked the girls mother and she upright admitted that she was aware that her child was infected with FMD which can be extremely fatal to humans who are younger/have less developed immune systems I couldnt believe this woman I informed my co-workers of the situation We immediately locked all of the classrooms because we didnt want anyone in the other classrooms to get infected It literally took over an hour to convince the mother to take her child out of the school It was literally impossible to convince her that shed done something wrong by taking her child outside let alone to a school filled with other younglings She attempted to fight the manager when we told her that she wouldnt be able to bring her child back into the school without proof from a local hospital that her daughter was no longer contagious After the insane woman left we spent a few hours sanitizing everything in the school It must have been a weird experience for the kids and teachers in the other classrooms They normally would have finished class a long time ago and would have been let out of the classroom for breaks but they had to just hang out in the classroom while we insured that wed done our best to make sure it was safe for the kids to come out TBH we shouldnt have had anything to do with this process There should have been some division of the government to contact to have them ensure that this is done properly especially given how this disease is famous for coming through areas and taking the lives of children in waves but yeah we didnt have such a luxury at our disposal COVID wasnt nearly as bad The government had clearly learned from SARS and figured out a way to deal with it in their own way After the COVID lockdown had ended it was really nice to see so many kids come to class wearing masks I even had co-workers wearing masks when they had a cold which is something I couldnt have imagined happening ever before COVID COVID really made me question why the hell we havent been wearing masks when under the weather all of these years I think it should be a given You shouldnt be free to spread your germs when youre feeling ill just regardless of whether or not you live in a free country,ThaddCorbett,16387743750,13

hfkfxux,q2ckda,The creation of a second class citizen group based on medical choice is a fascinating philosophical question that I dont think people are taking very seriously at the moment At the moment for most people this situation seems very cut and dry: "Get vaccine which helps you & others or else suffer the consequences" There are many good public health reasons to encourage vaccination - both via carrots and sticks However moving this premise out 20- 30- 50 years from now as technology advances would we feel comfortable with the same principles applying to other medical interventions? If we discovered a way (gattaca-style) to make some genetic tweaks that ensured a person would be at a much reduced chance for disease transfer in the future -- would that be okay to mandate (or deny services to that person if they didnt receive the genetic tweak)? Maybe so Maybe as society/ technology changes its entirely fine to mandate such things Its just an interesting philosophical question that I think we arent giving full consideration to yet,paro54,16334942450,126

gujn6zw,mqz31i,I saw a post in r/Connecticut that someone was charged an administration fee at UCONN Health I copied this off their site >Vaccine doses purchased with US taxpayer dollars will be given to the American people at no cost However vaccination providers such as UConn Health are able to charge an administration fee for giving the shot to someone **Vaccine providers can get this fee reimbursed by the patients public or private insurance company or for uninsured patients by the Health Resources and Services Administrations Provider Relief Fund** Just wanted to make sure people know that if they are uninsured and the place they get the vaccine asks for the fee tell them they have to bill the Feds Dont pay out of pocket,raynethackery,16184423410,72
gul012i,mqz31i,I have undocumented friends and what I heard is that is fine to show up to the vaccine appointment with zero documents like a passport or something; meaning if you think someomes afraid to get vaccines because they fear deportation encourage them to attend their appointment with no documents that could put them at risk if the person at the front or whatever doesnt know that they have to vaccinate you anyway escalate a little (as is safe) and a store manager will help you proceed (most people checking appointments are not always familiar with the nuanced immigration statuses) anyway popular post and buried bla bla but if youre reading this help us spread; whether or not you agree with undocumented immigrants getting rights or whatever is way better for our public safety that they get vaccinated so please help us get the word around!,dvidsilva,16184734270,4

hemif18,pxc6hb,So many people have been blaming Lebron for the anti-vaxx sentiment in the NBA Turns out hes already vaccinated Take that haters The Lakers are fully vaccinated EDIT: Also his endorsement on getting vaccinated carries sway in both the NBA and to the public,PepeBabinski,16328532770,43
heo4nit,pxc6hb,Using terms like did my research isnt helping anyone LeBron Thats just giving air and credence to the morons who think doing research is reading memes on Facebook LeBron didnt research shit Hes not a doctor or researcher Hes a basketball player and a businessman The truth of the matter here is that smarter people than LeBron did *their* research and he took medical advice which in and of itself is praiseworthy However kowtowing to the moronic segment of the community with "I did my research" is disingenuous at best and form LeBron downright dangerous at worst Jordan was selling sneakers when he said "Republicans buy sneakers too"; LeBron is playing a much much more consequential game,TakeshiKovacsSleeve3,16328792460,1

henx1y5,pxc6hb,Its perfectly reasonable to be skeptical Especially about a vaccine that was released so quickly But I think it was released around March-April for the general public It doesnt take 5-6 months to do your own research on this vaccine There are countless videos of Dr Fauci explaining how it was made what is in it how it works in the body the chances of having a negative reaction the testing process and how it was able to be released so quickly All that information is available to read on the CDC John Hopkins different hospital websites etcIts everywhere I guess my point is that it shouldnt have taken him this long to get the vaccine and the excuse of "doing your own research" just doesnt cut it IMO,BootySweat0217,16328756650,1

hjt6fwc,qpcnyc,Canadian here Forget about having them pay; Id like to just send the unvaccinated home Weve read so much about surgeries being canceled or delayed because ICU beds are taken up with COVID patients Just give them two Tylenols tell them to drink lots of water and have them call the coroner in the morning And then formalize it into a law that anyone who has declined a Health Canada recommended vaccine is not eligible for hospital treatment for that disease And I know there are plenty of other decisions and lifestyles people make that put a strain on the public health care system Overeating smoking drinking etc But none of these are as quick and easy to fix as just getting a free shot Nor are we fighting aggressive foreign-funded misinformation campaigns about them I feel like a hard stance needs to be taken that keeping up to date on vaccines is just a basic almost-zero-effort requirement for participating in a modern society particularly one with a public health care system,Hieremias,16363838220,10
hy7g5tb,szo1gx,I dont know what to tell internet people except that for a lot of us COVID changed nearly nothing The jobs didnt let us go home the bills kept coming no checks came in the mail except for those two that everyone mocked for being silly and not even covering one month of rent Unless we wanted to quit and stay home (no unemployment checks for quitters in the US) there was no real choice except to carry on mask up and go to work Its been same crap different day since March 2020 Sometimes you hear about somebodys granny passing away or your coworker goes home with COVID for two weeks while you pick up the slack and then they come back and thats the end of it Theres been a huge mismatch between the online wailing about COVID and the actual experience of living with it and when I say living with it I mean week in and week out in one of the industries where we had higher COVID death rates than the medical people did Line cooks dont take masking very seriously Too high probably think 5G is the virus MOST of the US has been in this boat the entire time The poor Amazon workers didnt get a single day off they got overtime Only on the internet do people seem to live in this weird parallel universe defined by work from home and perpetual COVID measures Its been a hell of a thing to watch people act like thats normal It doesnt matter what I think of any of it I didnt even get to stay home from work for a week while I watched the whole world slam the shutters at once thats how much power I have Call me all the names you want Tell me Im stupid or whatever I have no control over your situation Outside of your bubble its been "normal" this entire time Its been two solid years of everyone carrying on more or less as usual The virus has somehow avoided presenting a face to the public that would make them treat it like a mortal threat the way things like Ebola did and the bosses arent letting anyone off the hook since they can all stay home safe if they wanna Youre the educated middle class not me Youre the ones who should have come up with some sort of way to force whatever it is youre wanting on the world Perpetual work from home? I dont know what you want You had the money resources safety and time to do something about it politically All I know is that everyone has been living in "normal" for a quarter of a decade except for you deaths or no deaths It seems that all your kind can really muster is thinkpieces like this one that tell everyone what they already know and that will fail to convince anyone who doesnt want to know Its just ineffective handwringing except for maybe this writer made a buck from it Maybe Mourn if you want to but theyre obviously going to drag you all back into the offices by your scruffs that or fire you Again its been "normal" since like June 2020 and it looks like its finally your turn at that shit sandwich Whatever the hell this is thats normal now,AttackPug,16456826160,6

hy8btrk,szo1gx,COVID is costly in terms of its impact on health and the amount of people it kills but another cost that still rarely finds its way into the public discourse is the psychological cost of lockdowns People are social creatures and social activities are necessary for the proper psychological development of children for the maintenance of mental health for elderly and most importantly to avoid loneliness Dr John Cacioppo who passed in 2018 but was the worlds greatest mind on the topic of loneliness research estimated the cost of loneliness as being equivalent to smoking a pack of cigarettes per day And to clarify he wasnt talking about mere psychological discomfort he was talking about the impact of loneliness on our physiological health and the way loneliness actually causes people to die But when peoples lives are abbreviated by loneliness we dont record loneliness as the cause of death so it never shows up in population health statistics If you talk about COVID and lockdowns but avoid ignore things like compromised mental health addiction depression and loneliness then you are missing the bigger picture,LoudestGuyAtTheParty,16457042200,1
hy9n5yo,szo1gx,That article is based on the argument that our numbers are so high that its not rational to go back to normal so quickly What it ignored is the trend of the numbers - the numbers go up and down and it is now going down Its sad that there were 1M deaths But no amount of public health policy will bring them back Its time to learn from the past and move forward,dchobo,16457245730,1
