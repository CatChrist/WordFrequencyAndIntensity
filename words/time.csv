ho1fm7h,rdg5q3,If anyone thinks that child sex trafficking is fake news then you havent been paying attention to what happens every year in our country and the poorest countries around the world! These people prey on the poor just as they abuse them for work they also use them for their own devious purposes! This is as old as our history MEN have sought out the vulnerable and taken advantage of them and abused them for whatever purpose they wanted! As a survivor of this type of destructive behavior it has taken me a long time to realize that it wasnt my fault but it breaks you down piece by piece until you start self medicating and then you are deemed a delinquent though the judges and lawyers know what happens when a child is thrust into something like this they have no compassion for the children they add abuse on top of the abuse! We have tried to bury this stuff for too long and it is time for those who are elected to protect and serve have to be held accountable and forced to start doing their job! I could tell all of the heart wrenching stories but it will not help to change some of the peoples minds that are in charge! The only time that they come close to caring is when it happens to a child of status and even then they try to bury it! They have the money to pay off the officials in the right places and it just keeps happening! I spent most of my life with anger and self medication and it hasnt really been much help I hope that this is a start to holding them accountable maybe this one woman will open the door for all to see just how pervasive this really is but she is going to have to draw a roadmap to how these people do the things they do!

Even if they like the underage look They just look for women that are 18 but look underage Everytime I see one of jeffrey epsteins girls I wonder why hed sex traffic THAT They are not even that hot If all he wanted was sex orgies with super hot women all he needed to do was to supply sugar My friend got much hotter women from his Craigslist ads,Twiottle,16391950700,-1

guq7l4g,ms2o0d,I didnt appreciate how destructive private healthcare is until I got epilepsy If I had to pay out of pocket for the years of tests and hospitalizations Ive had I would quite literally be on the street Having chronic medical issues feels unfair enough in the first place If it had me in debt for life on top of that I would lose my mind Sure universal healthcare can be slow as fuck sometimes but it wont cost you your home,mozzarella_lavalamp,16185832420,110
guqfr1c,ms2o0d,What gets me its a couple things about how the system is fucked 1- we tax payers give grant money to smaller pharmaceutical companies The big companies dont want to do research and make medicine for very specific diseases that are rare and only affect a smaller pool of the population they want big net many fish So these smaller companies know this so they know they only way they can compete Id by looking for what disease is getting ignored/not being addressed directly so that becomes their niche But they dont have the money so they get a grant from the government This boosts their budget they increase employment and research and voila theyve created a treatment Now here comes the bigger pharmaceutical companies they see the need medicine and buy out the smaller company They then in turn self the new product at an outrageous price Talk about a winning scenario All you got to do is wait for a smaller company to get grant money do all the work and just buy them So we as tax payers pay to have these medicines made just to then pay for them at a steeper price and we dont get the grant money back 2- There is so much money in lobbying from Pharmaceutical companies (#1 lobbying industry by far) that they were able to convince Congress to vote against themselves being able to negotiate Medicare pharmaceutical prices with those companies A major reason these companies love America is because every other first world country has a system in place to make sure prices dont get out of hand We are their cash cow 3- Along with the pharmaceutical industry the health insurance industry (another top lobbying industry) is also a giant racket that takes advantage of us all These companies have done an amazing job to label things like universal healthcare as "socialist" and yea it might be but they dont care about that they just want you to be afraid of it because it would lead to them losing money The other thing that gets me is people who say "I dont want to pay for your insurance" thing is you already do we already do When an uninsured person goes to the ER they have to be treated When they cant pay the hospital gets that money through the insured by up charging everything Healthcare shouldnt be a for profit business at least to a point Healthcare doesnt fit the traditional supply and demand economic model of capitalism because the demand is always going to be high People are willing to spend whatever it takes to be alive You cant put a price on your life and theres companies know this Need a new heart? Well there isnt a discount store for that heres your bill Need life saving insulin? Well pay our prices because we convinced the government its illegal to go to Canada for 1/10 the price Healthcare and medicine shouldnt be political We put the most into our broken system than any other country and we get the least out of it All we have to do is follow the money and see whos profiting because odds are theyre the ones who stand to lose the most by changing the system Its the same thing with all the sentiment against renewable energy Whos profiting now and whos going to lose out by going to renewable energy?

he wrote a White House official that he was in favor of a "National Endowment in support of free institutions throughout the world" >The NED was initially placed under the auspices of the National Security Council and one Walter Raymond Jr a CIA propaganda expert who according to the late Robert Parry for years acted as liaison between the program and Casey Raymond also drew charming doodles like this depicting himself as a literal puppeteer controlling many different strings >The organization was stacked with prominent neoconservatives like Lane Kirkland John Richardson and Allen Weinstein Carl Gershman a longtime professional anticommunist was its first and so far only president One of its current board members Elliott Abrams is a war criminal with a history of subverting democracy overseas >To prevent the odor of US imperialism from contaminating the NEDs work the Reagan administration made it a private organization that in turn funded several more private institutions including the NDI and IRI But the fact that it was routinely staffed with former US officials and got its funding from the US government has always made this a dubious conceit >Equally dubious was the idea that its task was simply to promote democracy Two of its "core grantees"  which receive around 70 percent of its funding  are explicitly right wing: the IRI which is a GOP-led institution that once described its goals as advancing "democracy the rule of law and free-market economics"; and the Center for International Private Enterprise a project of the **US Chamber of Commerce** Even the Solidarity Center (formerly the Free Trade Union Institute) which is affiliated with the **AFL-CIO** went on to support conservative causes Only the NDI the Democrats arm could be said to be anywhere left of center Overall the NEDs track record tilts decidedly to the right CIPE and The Solidarity Center are two of the four grantees of the [NED](https://wwwsolidaritycenterorg/national-endowment-for-democracy-ned-ndi-iri-cipe-and-solidarity-center-welcome-increased-funding-from-congress/) NED does what the CIA used to do behind closed doors I thought the NED was pretty interesting considering Time Magazines story about the secret shadow campaign to save the [2020 election](https://timecom/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/) The article mentions multiple times how the group was working to protect and save Democracy (democracy is used ~33 times in the article) The article also outlines an alliance that included the AFL-CIO and the US Chamber of Commerce: >The pact was formalized in a terse little-noticed joint statement of the US Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO published on Election Day This article from [socialismcom](https://socialismcom/fs-article/betrayal-from-venezuela-to-iraq-the-afl-cio-and-the-national-endowment-for-democracy/) discusses how NED is a CIA front is funded by the US government and works closely with the leaders of the AFL-CIO: >A little-known far-right organization with a warm and fuzzy name the National Endowment for Democracy is up to no good in at least 40 countries That is bad enough especially given that the money for NEDs dirty deeds comes from working taxpayers courtesy of the US Congress Truly appalling however is the role that leaders of the AFL-CIO the largest US labor federation play in carrying out the work of this agency > A CIA front is born During the late 1970s the CIA was exposed for its active sabotage of numerous governments and progressive labor movements abroad Not so publicized was the AFL-CIOs role in aiding the CIA >Operating through the American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD) the AFL-CIO aided the overthrow of democratically elected governments in Guyana in 1963 Brazil in 1964 the Dominican Republic in 1965 and Chile in 1973 These are just a few examples of labor officialdoms shameful record in helping to carry out corporate-propelled US foreign policy >In 1983 after the CIA was widely discredited Ronald Reagans administration created a new agency the NED to take care of old business As an NED founder Allen Weinstein put it in 1991: "A lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA" >In his hard-hitting book Rogue State: A Guide to the Worlds Only Superpower William Blum describes some of the agencys activities "NED successfully manipulated elections in Nicaragua in 1990 and Mongolia in 1996 helped to overthrow democratically elected governments in Bulgaria in 1990 and Albania in 1991 and 1992 and was busy working in Haiti in the late 1990s on behalf of rightwing groups **NED like the CIA before it calls what it does supporting democracy** The governments and movements whom the NED targets call it destabilization" From the [Time 2020 election story:](https://timecom/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/) >"The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation" says Norm Eisen >The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation >The system didnt work magically Democracy is not self-executing" >And they believe the public needs to understand the systems fragility in order to ensure that democracy in America endures,Settlemente,16187557890,1

Each when viewed dispassionately and in isolation are terrible outcomes - an innocent man lost his life on one hand and rampant child exploitation on the other One caused by police the other caused by an elite group of dirty fucks operating in secret Due process required in BOTH cases But it sure does seem that the MSM loves pedos,1159,16190541040,16

gwmpirj,n2nxhj,The totality of evidence surrounding Private Johnsons execution-style murder strongly suggests that the person who killed her is former four-star Army General **Kevin P Byrnes** He was third in seniority among the Armys eleven generals at the time Byrnes who was appointed to his command position by President George W Bush in November 2002 headed the Armys Training and Doctrine Command (1st Cavalry Division) or TRADOC command In this capacity Byrnes supervised the recruitment and academic programs at thirty-three Army schools from basic training to the war colleges Private Johnson met General Byrnes in July 2005 just a couple of days before her death As fate would have it Private Johnson wrote his name in her personal notepad and told her father about her one-on-one conversation with him She had no way of knowing at the time that Byrnes (a) was engaged in an extramarital affair with a civilian female and (b) had been ordered by **General Peter J Schoomaker** the Armys Chief of Staff to end the affair Byrnes who was married willfully disobeyed Schoomakers order and instead elected to make his love affair more clandestine In doing so Byrnes risked being court-martialed for disobeying Schoomakers lawful and direct order Extramarital affairs among military generals while strictly prohibited by the military are not unusual Sometimes these affairs lead to reckless impulsive and even criminal conduct as the participants do everything within their power to indulge in the affairs under a cloak of secrecy The torrid love affair between **General David Petreaus** and his lover **Paula Broadwell** is a recent high profile example of this type of deceitful reckless conduct and criminal conduct Like Petreaus General Byrnes TRADOC command gave him the means and opportunity to practice the deception that accompanied his adultery Like Petreaus Byrnes found ways to evade the Pentagons scrutiny of his extramarital affair particularly after Byrnes was ordered to stop his affair Byrnes illicit love affair came to light only after his unanticipated encounter with Private Johnson caused its exposure During the early morning hours of July 19th Private Johnson inadvertently encountered General Byrnes engaging in the very romance he had been ordered to stop She was alone at the time because the Army never assigned Private Johnson a "battle buddy" to accompany her around the base Private Johnsons discovery of Byrnes continued adultery left him startled afraid and desperate Byrnes snapped and became violent toward Private Johnson who did not fight back because she was as shocked as he was and because Byrnes was her TRADOC commander During his assault on Private Johnson Byrnes knocked some of her teeth backwards broke her nose fractured her neck and inflicted other serious injuries on her body Private Johnson was then dragged into a contractors tent where Byrnes staged the crime scene to make it look like Private Johnson had committed suicide,jdhyp13,16199356390,5

h2m38om,o543q5,Hey Fuck banks I had an account with SunTrust and some of their policies were straight up scams The one that got me was how they dont accept deposits after 9pm but they will absolutely clear pending charges at all times of the night So when I deposited cash through the ATM the deposit didnt clear into morning But some pending charges all went through at night which overdrafted my account But then also the overdraft fee comes out before the deposit Another good one Your "current balance" in their app can be totally inaccurate Ive had them tell me this The current balance may not always be accurate So you have to keep track yourself Then what good is your stupid app? And my favorite conspiracy theory on banks? I swear banks intentionally hold pending charges when your account gets below a certain point And wait until you make another purchase Then bam! Send all the pending charges through at once overdrafting your account with the last purchase I cant prove this but Ive seen charges sit pending in my account for 2-3 weeks Then all go through all at once after I use my debit card thinking the charges have cleared And another conspiracy theory How do we know banks arent skimming fractions of pennies from every charge from every customer?

gwfrqxh,n1sfuh,I love that this sub deals with the conspiracies in plain view! So cool to see people in this mindset - that our economic and political system is a kind of open-air conspiracy I heard Snowden said something to this effect recently - that the biggest conspiracies are in plain sight The whole idea that we have to stick to the status quo that change is threatening this is like the Matrix that keeps us all trapped as collaborators with the powers principalities and archons who wield power from behind the scenes\* \*As Tracy Jordan said in the early 2000s sitcom 30 Rock "the government is injecting HIV into our chicken nuggets -- thats a metaphor!!" At the deepest level I dont believe in the dichotomization of mankind into three categories: (1) Mentally enslaved peasants who see a facade world (2) Elite rulers who understand the real workings of power and (3) enlightened sages who operate outside the system In reality I think were all more like the mentally enslaved peasants Human rationality is pretty limited and it burns insane amounts of calories time and effort to engage with any aspect of reality No one can do it for long People who have political and social power are lucky freaks who have latched onto some heuristics that work (for the moment) They dont really know whats going on either Their power wont last forever and their hurtful choices are often the product of their being as limited and finite as the rest of us Human society looks (to me) like a weird churn of groups of people rising and falling - like a chaotic washing machine Randos figure it out (like the Romans) they rise then they fall as their systems break or their principles become outdated and new groups rise (like Visgoth invasion of Roman Empireand the eventual emergence of the Feudal societythen the consolidation of Church powerand then the fragmentation of the Church and the rise of the nation state) Today we see it in the US The tumbling has made {China United States} {Amazon Google Facebook Haliburton Skynet} {the CIA The Democratic Party & Republic Party} these incredible locuses of power at their respective levels which crudely co-exist in a tense dynamism that is always tumbling around equilibrium But they wont last forever - someday Jeff Bezzos will be dead and the robot or clone they trot out as proof of his immortality will be only nominally Jeff Bezzos Amazon will be a footnote in history the CIA will be gone replaced probably by something even weirder Even the United States will dissolve or be invaded by a foreign power or slide into irrelevancy (perhaps along with the nation-state itselfheres hoping that the era of large-power wars is over and the nation state will slide into irrelevance opening the gates for more and more independent communities and expanding the possibilities for human freedom without bringing about decentralized forms of micro-slavery) Even within any given community theres an unstable hierarchy Join a Church get a corporate job or join a professional organization even in a seemingly flat and parodical organization like your local chapter of Hash House Harriers you still see that theres a churn of people at the top and people not And even seemingly smart or lovable or hard-working folks cant guarantee their spot forever All any of us can do is keep grinding away in our search for truth and goodness trying to be better asking the Benevolent Higher Power(s) for aide and assistance helping others rinse wash and repeat What a world We are lucky to be here If we are,DoktorSpengler,16197978280,2

gv4vq22,mu01bz,I bet one could change the statistical likelihood of mass shootings by adjusting what we see in our news feeds If you went through the view history of the people that ended up commiting past mass shootings it would probably validate this belief I dont think they can necessary choose who will shoot what To a degree its up to chance but I bet you gun violence is more associated with how often a person sees news articles of mass shootings than it is to access to guns I also dont doubt that a tech company if they wanted to could use user phone data to know what personality types are most susceptible to this influence and could adjust those peoples feeds accordingly Humans are pretty simple;monkey see monkey do If they can use an advertisement to make a percentage of the population more likely to eat stake then they could use one to make them more likely to go on a shooting The media attention the crying parents the name in the news paper Every time I click on my newsfeed Im bombarded by news articles It looks almost like positive re-enforcement In theory I dont doubt they could double or triple the mass shooting rate at any moment they want Now would any entity have the balls to do this? I dont know I just know it could be done Remember though its not really as common as it seems on tv Even if they could double or triple the rate you are still much more likely to be effected by smoking or heart disease All they would need is two or three separate instances a week to influence the psyche of the nation,FailOsprey,16188707140,1

h88st99,p0j98z,The world is like a ride in an amusement park and when you choose to go on it you think its real because thats how powerful our minds are The ride goes up and down around and around it has thrills and chills and its very brightly colored and its very loud and its fun for a while Many people have been on the ride a long time and they begin to wonder "Hey is this real or is this just a ride?" And other people have remembered and they come back to us and say "Hey dont worry; dont be afraid ever because this is just a ride" And we  kill those people "Shut him up! Ive got a lot invested in this ride shut him up! Look at my furrows of worry look at my big bank account and my family This has to be real" Its just a ride But we always kill the good guys who try and tell us that you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok  But it doesnt matter because its just a ride And we can change it any time we want Its only a choice No effort no work no job no savings of money Just a simple choice right now between fear and love The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors buy guns close yourself off The eyes of love instead see all of us as one Heres what we can do to change the world right now to a better ride Take all that money we spend on weapons and defenses each year and instead spend it feeding and clothing and educating the poor of the world which it would pay for many times over not one human being excluded and we could explore space together both inner and outer forever in peace,QuotesBillHicks,16284780350,29

h88guas,p0j98z,Mental illness is rising for 2 reasons 1) better identification and more diverse diagnostic criteria Back in the day your cousin was just "melancholic" rather than clinically depressed Thankfully weve moved to a more person centred therapy model for the most part that can identify increments of disorder 2) we love in a post capitalism hellscape where children are forced to run lemonade stands to pay for their insulin Non-clinical depression could be reduced dramatically if people were provided with more money less pressure and more time for self care But an exhausted and overstressed population has no energy to fight So were kept perpetually in crisis so were to scared to want change Covid probably threatened this balance more than any other event in recent history because our leaders *needed* to act or theyd be seen as incompetent and the only clear course of action gave many people a chance to relax recharge and see how much better the world could be Yes there was increased stress but after seeing how it could have been handled weve all started to realise how ripped off weve been for decades Thats why Ill never understand this idea that Covid is some tool of control its actually quite the opposite The more effective tool of control has been the squashing of critical thinking skills and the advanced propaganda techniques surrounding conspiracies Global elites can now hide anything in a conspiracy because theres a conspiracy about everything I think they learnt this around the 911 conspiracy time If left unchecked conspiracies get wilder and weirder until none of it seems plausible They just need whatever their doing to be on the bottom end of believable and well create the smoke screen for them by talking about lizard people and sacrificial children magic,Valor816,16284716440,1

h1qdgrf,nzlzfq,Youre absolutely right but its a much more extensive issue that your post taps into: namely the way that the environmental movement (and all of the various environmental groups like Greenpeace) was hijacked by corporations to push the global warming narrative which has completely overshadowed every other environmental issue for activists and which pins the blame on workers and lower classes and lets the corporations escape blame justice or all responsibility for cleaning up the damage they have done to the planet It started with the Thatcher government in the UK she deliberately funded research to prove carbon emissions had a negative impact so that she could break the backs of the coal miners who were striking It was a deliberate strategy to completely destroy organized labour and it worked and her counterpart in USA Ronnie Ray-Gun was busy doing the same thing dismantling any corporate controls and regulations while simultaneously destroying organized labour Both were agents of the new corporate tyranny The Gilets Jaunes movement in France encapsulates this perfectly: how its a class issue and how the global warming legislation hurts working class people Environmental Activists used to protest major corporations and financial institutions and government institutions nuclear power plant protests factory farms oil refineries hijacking pipelines etc but what happened with this psyop is that the shift led to the faux activism of Greta and Extinction Rebellion (which again attacks working class people by blocking them from going to work etc) which mostly replaced and distracted from the real issues The entire debate has been reframed with "deniers" on one side and on the other side if you care about the environment then you affirm the official narrative and therefore agree with the laws Both sides are incorrect because the entire framing is incorrect The way I approach it is I simply focus on the more existential and urgent environmental issues like microplastics in every living being on the plant for instance and 99% of the time these are the direct result of multinational corporations So take the environmental position but just sidestep the framing and address the real issues: nobody can attack you for actually caring about the environment and instead of getting distracted by entangling yourself in the pro or con global warming game just step back and realize its a psyop People are being pushed to fear something that isnt concretely evident to them a narrative that isnt intuitive (the idea that carbon which is necessary for plants is dangerous and an existential threat -- which by the way Im neither affirming nor denying Im simply stating that you cant see it with your own eyes so it becomes a "trust the experts" issue) while the things that are concretely evident like plastic pollution are being demoted to the bottom of the concern list But people can see with their own eyes the way that giant corporations are destroying the planet The evidence is overwhelming Now the next step is to realize that this exact same formula and process applies to every other major issue from war to immigration Start with the shift from class to race/ identity: From 2008-10 there was mass mobilization of workers and activism focused on class (the 99% vs the 1%) where the masses were joining together and attacking wallstreet and giant corporations So again we see the exact same pattern: the Occupy movement being hijacked and overshadowed by BLM and LGBTQ identity politics and also the exact same formula applies to the Covid-19 narrative and the risks and dangers of the virus and also the vaccine The MO is the same (and it also happened in the 60s with COINTELPRO) Its crystal clear once you put it together Chomskys Manufacturing Consent outlines the Modus Operandi for all of these propaganda and psyop campaigns pushed through by corporate media,FruitFlavor12,16236799210,53

i0zezv3,tg0kom,I posted this almost a year ago and have kept copying and pasting it because a lot of it has come true since then Ill warn you its long though This is a copy from another post but lines up the events of history that are being copied right now And why so many *Financial Issues* are being disguised (such as climate issues or pandemic issues) But a lot of this has happened before and is being full-on copied from other time periods and how even blackrock (the single largest hedge fund and called "The Fourth Branch of the US Government by Forbes and Bloomberg) [wrote the entire financial blueprint of what was going to happen before covid even started back in August 2019](https://wwwblackrockcom/corporate/literature/whitepaper/bii-macro-perspectives-august-2019pdf) Were seeing a complete system change why we needed to pump out a ton of money (literally 40% of all Dollars in existence were created in the last year) and why we need a WORLDWIDE unique Identification system tied to single individuals and a unique ID (a passport that is financial in its requirement but right now is being pushed through medical global requirements) Corona is a financial issue disguised as a pandemic issue because it can circumvent local laws and force the wordlwide laws Climate change is a financial issue being disguised as an ecosystem issue because again those laws are "bigger" than local laws and can circumvent normal procedures ----- We know "follow the money" to be the oldest and truest sense of deducing whats going on One of the things that stands out is that this event is following exactly the same events of the 20s and 70s Both times marked by huge inflation both times marked by a currency change and a new system and both times marked by a war that took place to get rid of the old system and expand the system while countries are hit hard by inflation But they all follow the same play ook = a massive amount of money was printed out and a certain assets price was then crashed that people were holding onto In the 20s-30s the asset was gold (whos price skyrocketed as money was printed and then crashed right before a market crash) and now with crypto currency (bitcoin was $7200 in january 2020 and got up to $60000 before crashing down to $32000 and flying back up to $65000 again and will probably crash even further once again before the final drop before it raises to crazy levels in ten years) In the case of gold the conspiracy is that two men formed a group and tried to corner the market and then the US released all its gold shares to crash that market and everyone sold their gold the US then used that price to buy gold from people and then backed the dollar with gold and even made owning it illegal alsoone of those two men who tried cornering the market was the Presidents brother in law so it was clearly a setup and a lot of people lost money but the US gained a lot of gold at cheaper prices right before switching the currency to be backed by gold So it was all about currency So why is the same thing happening again? August was the 50th year anniversary of Nixon ending the gold backed dollar in the 70s and starting the petro backed dollar So what does the end of the currency look like? Remember I said there was a crash for gold because the US released all its stores and crashed the market? Well guess [who owns the most bitcoin](https://wwwwiredcom/2013/12/fbi-wallet/)? Well for starters everyone will need a personal wallet (hence a vaccine passport for tracking is going to come sooner or later but this is the best excuse) The current chair of the SEC (Gary Gensler) who was installed in April taught a class about crypto currency at MIT Sloane (which is an enlightening resource if you want to see how officials view crypto currencies) He even talks about bitcoin finishing a 10 year testing phase and how it survived {what does that even mean? I thought Satoshi Nakamoto was an anonymous person I thought crypto was all about a decentralized financial platform and yet the current head of the SEC says it survived a testing phase?} So what else do we know signifies the end of the petro dollar? Weve all seen how much climate change pops up Well plastics are part of the oil system and thats part of the end too is my guess I know people think its an environmental factor for climate change but we all know that the biggest changes arent happening (a very tiny percentage accounts for the most pollutants but nothing is done about those) But following the money its clear that climate change is a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue This is extremely clear because two separate Senate and house committees met with banks in May about climate changewhy would they meet with banks instead of oil companies or manufacturers? Again the evidence points to a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue But theyre pushing us simply to change what system we consume while avoiding the largest climate change pollutants And even ending the oil system next is energy sourcingwell enter in Afghanistan popping up again and the Taliban/ISIS (which is where the largest lithium deposit is) But the key point is that we will move off of seaparate working grids (because even if you steal gasoline it still works on your vehicle) onto one grid that uses unique identification (which electrical vehicles already do but again is part of the movement away from the machine driven system and into the computer/tracking system) And what about the old infrastructure? Have you noticed how all those hacking attacks kept happening to old infrastructure key points? And the hackers keep asking other countries for huge amount of bitcoin? Have you noticed how war keeps popping up involving all those countries on the old system? Must be a complete coincidence Im sure But well know for sure this is the case if the market crashes soon Hyperinflation is close and technically happening but the FED refuses to acknowledge it (crazy how we dont vote for the FED president and yet they control the entire economy) Weve now had the largest 12 month increase in inflation since 1983 The CPI has changed over and over how inflation is measured true inflation is estimated anywhere from 13% - 25% (but you already know that and likely got your rent hiked already up 20% year-over-year) Thats what happened in the 30s right as they switched to a new backing for the dollar (with Gold) and were seeing all the signs present now that this is true If were about to end the machine driven age and start the computer driven stage then we would each need a unique wallet address and a passport can accompany that It would be the easiest way to install worldwide tracking (since crypto provides a ledger for everything) Also well know bitcoin prices will shoot through the roof after a crash if all this is true and happens Either way this ties corona (an excuse for mass printing of money) the vaccine (more money and a unique wallet tied to ID) end of petro dollar and machine age (climate change is a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue end of plastics from oil) end of the retail to stores system and move to full digital marketplace the beginning of the crypto dollar and crashing the crypto markets (already happened but still can drop much farther along with the rest of the market similar to exact same scenarios in the past) Were entering into the most tracked age of all time everything on the planet will be tracked back to unique ids and monitored on a blockchain/verified by a computer "The Great Reset" might sound like a conspiracy meme but thats an awful lot of coordination to happen in a short period of time Even better since I wrote this the IMF and 10 countries got together in Israel and [Simulated a Cyber Attack that would shut down the Global Financial System](https://financeyahoocom/news/exclusive-imf-10-countries-simulate-133015124html) Im sure thats just a coincidence too! Im sure once it happens everyone will be shocked and demand answersthat they already have Its coming my guess is at the start of Bidens second term since thats when they did it with Nixon Ill keep writing this and if Im wrong I will stop but weve been checking off each point from that paper by Blackrock ever since corona started Every company put money back into their company and was given a massive amount with the PPP loans and every country matched financial and monetary policies and was given massive amounts of money during corona Soif the market started showing signs of a massive failure in 2019 and this paper was put out in August 2019 and weve followed every item line by line of this outline since then and it came before coronathen what does that say about corona This was the single largest robbery in history and unless you are in the 1% then you are going to be the one paying for it You paid for it not just with two full years of your life hearing about this you didnt just pay by having communities torn apart or having to hear people argue about things that arent the actual problem you didnt just pay for it by having to actually stay in solitary confinement that includes the ability to watch your phone and the internetyou literally are going to actually pay for the rest of your life with the inflation costs and debt Well see if this is rightbut weve already checked off most the points from that paper The rich got so insanely rich since this happened It was literally the best year for Wall Street but how was it for most people?,garthsworld,16474938020,2

Who is or isnt invited "We have to invite so & so because of this frivolous empty reason" Combine the 2 & you have phoniness on top of phoniness Best example I can think of is Howard Stern He had Chevy Chase & Donald Trump at his 2007 wedding He had Trump on the show but they were never social And he had just "made up" with Chevy after a feud & immediately gives him an invite while snubbing long time show staff & friends With her connections its not crazy that she was there on a superficial level Again I do think they conspired But I dont think this is a big deal to point to,SiriusC,16230724380,35

gwe22ao,n13x8h,Law enforcement in itself is not about justice Theyre order-followers And order-followers do as theyre told with no thought of their own about whether its right or wrong - for a paycheck Once you understand who is *really* giving the orders the Epstein situation makes perfect sense Heres a clue: Notice the black & white chess-board symbolism police wear around their heads? The occult meaning for that: Not knowing the difference between right & wrong Police officers owners and they *do* have owners put that symbolism there intentionally as a form of mockery They put it directly around police officers brains Their owners laugh hysterically about this behind closed doors The problem is those who work in law enforcement have confused man-made law with actual justice (Natural Law) They dont see the difference - and there is an *enormous* difference They need an understanding of Natural Law and there is a lot of effort put forth to hide knowledge of Natural Law from the public Natural Law is logic-based and contains absolute truths about morality Man-made laws on the other hand involve people writing down that they have "authority" over others and then mind-controlling the public into believing that makes that authority real Of course it doesnt in reality But the reason things like Epsteins death are allowed to happen is because the people working in law enforcement simply do as theyre told by their higher-ups regardless of whether its actually right or wrong No real improvement will occur for humanity in terms of all these conspiracies until far more people begin understanding Natural Law and applying it to their actions instead of believing in the supposed "authority" of government Thats the root of the problem for *all* conspiracies - and the solution We are quickly running out of time to do this And the vast majority of people believe in the legitimacy of the authority of government right now That needs to change Were nowhere near where we need to be with not much time left Anyone reading this please help spread the word about Natural Law Look into it for yourself if you dont know about it,Law_of_1,16197586280,3

I really dont buy the idea that shed be afraid for her life I dont think she wants to spend years in prison and probably sees that as a fate worse than death,TallGrayAndSexy,16408743500,193

hqkr163,rs1onc,Its like nobody in /r/conspiracy follows any news but /r/conspiracy Epstein was having sex with these teenage girls Epstein (sometimes with Maxwells help) recruited them and paid them for sex ie rape That is trafficking Years ago before he killed himself Epstein was convicted on sex charges; again recruiting and paying girls to come to his Palm Springs mansion and massage him and provide sexual favors ie rape That is also trafficking Apparently Epstein also coerced some of these girls to have sex with his friends or acquaintances Prince Andrew and Alan Dershowitz That is also trafficking Epstein wasnt kidnapping children from third-world villages and selling them on the dark web Epstein did not run a "pedophile ring" You can imagine that everyone who ever met or was in a photo with Jeffrey Epstein was constantly gang-raping children (and apparently thats what this sub is for) but there is simply no evidence to suggest that Epstein was trafficking girls other than for *his own* enjoyment and perhaps eventually a couple of his acquaintances Thats it folks Calm your conspiracy boners,Natural-Born_Easman,16408886500,1

He was responsible for keeping the words largest child sex ring trafficker alive to testify! Whats even sketchier is that Trumps DOAs dad was best buds with Epstein and got Epstein important positions that he was professionally unqualified for Oh yeah the same father also wrote a book about a billionaire pedophile sex ring alien slave cult To summarize: William Barr was the Trump Attorney General at the time His father Donald Barr was long-term good friends with Epstein and even got him high paying jobs that he wasnt qualified for Trump used to hang out with Epstein all the time in the 90s and 00s they even threw a private party with Trump Epstein and multiple of Epsteins prostitutes My opinion: Trump and Barr killed Epstein because Barr was protecting his father/himself and Trump obviously protecting his own skin,blarn_draper,16408985320,-1
hqkvtkf,rs1onc,Although a good number of people are being blackmailed theres another group of people who subscribe to an epicurean do what thou wilt philosophy and so see nothing wrong with having a little "fun" Even if the kids is hurt or traumatized "who cares"? It doesnt really matter in the end Nothing does And this philosophy of "nothing really matters in the end" - this is the ontological heart of western liberalism Its all a bunch of ad-hoc "guesstimating" which may be sophisticated in its planning but completely stupid at its philosophical foundation I remember watching a lecture a long long time ago when I was a different person On one side of the debate was the fiery Rabbi Meir Kahane notorious for his impassioned zionism and his own aspirations to become a leader in Israeli politics Kahane had a very charismatic personality as it was impossible not to like him; also he seemed to understand the decadence at the core of western civilization philosophy and culture which spoke to me On the other hand Kahane was militantly jingoistic in much of his rhetoric and often advocated policies that seemed a bit insane - like totally inviting the rancor of the surrounding world upon the Jewish state On the other side of the debate was a poinderextery Alan Dershowitz With his curly hair bushy mustache short posture and his trademark brazenness Dershowitz was arguing on the side of "liberalism" and its value to human life It was a good debate Interesting It was Kahanes charmisma versus Dershowitz yelling And despite being such a short and unattractive guy - there is something unusually energetic about Dershowitz If you listen to this man speak he really seems to believe exactly what he says It seems impossible to think that he is simply "lawyering" you yet this is what hes doing What kind of minds do people like alan dershowitz have? It seems strange and unusually Unnerving even Something odd Uncanny unfamiliar Could it be this man speaks with a forked tongue? How many politicians convey what seems like sincerity - and is indeed sincerity - yet is a false sincerity a weaponized sincerity a killing you with kindness type of orientation A person who experiences his embodiment as a tool to be used and not something to be identified with In short it is simply astonishing how utterly different a human life can feel On one end are the aggrandizers who *weaponize kindness love and compassion to suit their own aggrandizing ends* Its astonishingly disingenuous cold and cruel These people feel in short fundamentally invulnerable On the other end is the reverse situation; people so enfeebled and tortured by life that they will adopt any posture rule and quality - typically will abide by the structure of reality - in order to live unmolested by negative feelings To feel peace in other words - albeit such peace necessitating a tolerant attitude to experiences of discomfort and pain,SockMaximum,16408904710,0

hmgdleq,r45a5n,I remember when this was first discovered/posted on r/conspiracy back when she was arrested in 2020 and the account suddenly went dark It was fascinating to watch it come together in real time This information had better be a part of the prosecutions case in the trial Ill tell you why Im 99% sure personally that /u/maxwellhill was Lady Ghislaine herself I also am about 75% sure Aaron Swartz unearthed EVERYTHING related to Jeffrey&Ghislaine/Intelligence Agencies/human trafficking/political blackmail/Moloch when he hacked the MIT research lab which Jeffrey was a prominent associate of Aaron hacked the private servers there and found something he was NOT supposed to find and was soon charged with such extreme punishments by the court system which led to his suicide (I have no reason to think he was assassinated but of course it wouldnt surprise me Look up [the relationship between Courtney Love and her father/The Grateful Dead/CIA/MKUltra](https://covertactionmagazinecom/2021/07/21/u-s-intelligence-coverup-newly-declassified-fbi-file-on-nirvanas-kurt-cobain-compounds-evidence-implicating-his-wifes-role-in-his-murder/) Kurt was likely assassinated by these forces for being a political thorn in their side to a much lesser degree than Aaron was becoming Smart skilled young men who competently buck the system are their worst nightmare and must be *crucified*) Aaron died in 2013 and /u/maxwellhill IIRC showed up as a high level account around 2012 The SOPA/PIPA protests spearheaded by Aaron and others in his circle were around 2012 and their success put Aaron on the elites map in a bad way Then when he found whatever he found hacking MIT he became a HUGE problem for their scheme Poor kid probably had no idea what to do with himself 26 years old and to discover all this by yourself and to live with it alone? Think of the emotional trauma we have all endured in the last years as all this has come out and weve had each other to get through it all Aaron had no one He was probably absolutely fucked in the head/heart by the time he died You know maybe I dont know 100% if any of this is true But it sure does add up Also the McGraw-Hill textbook company (the makers of all our K-12 school history textbooks) is owned by the Maxwell family So /u/maxwellhill controls the narrative just as McGraw-Hill does Its a cute pun Ill give her that,umbertostrange,16381375500,124

i0egqpb,tcdedn,This is not truth this stance doesnt even make sense to me this is just a pussy way to say that you are afraid of Russia and you blame Ukraine and the US for "poking the bear" Its an attempt to show a neutral stance but shows a lack of recognition of events UN/NATO never threatened Russian sovereignty or the country at all Ukraine never threatened Russian sovereignty The US never threatened Russian sovereignty However Russia threatens Ukrainian sovereignty and the sovereignty of other nations like Georgia since 2008 and Moldova Putin is threatening nuclear war if we dont let him get what he wants Russia has waged proxy wars similar to the Ukrainian proxy war that started in 2014 that made the recognition of the DPR and LPR areas possible for a long time Ukraine voted 92% in favor of independence from Russia when the USSR fell NATO is a defensive alliance and independent countries should be able to choose their security agreements Especially considering these smaller countries (that are smaller than Ukraine) are obviously at risk from Russian interest Ukraine used to be Russia but by that logic alot of our countries would not be considered legitimate The US did back a coup in Ukraine in 2014 against a man Putin put in charge the same way he rigs his own elections all these years The Ukrainian people fought for the change in government so they could have their own and I find it funny how many Americans want to criticize wanting to change their government with help from another country As if American independence wasnt funded by France The only threat NATO poses to Russia is to Russian oligarch interest in invading countries or waging proxy wars to gain territory for "security" or resources So the reason why its offensive is bc its stupid,BigDisco6,16471117520,1
i0ct57w,tcdedn,yup this isnt our fight but we are being made to fight it with our wallets with our dollars with our purchasing power and with our general overall national sentiment anyone that isnt from that part of the world or doesnt have family in that part of the world have no say in the matter not even those fiscally involved because you can uninvolve yourself very easily you cant just stop being ukranian or russian theres going to be a massive wave of asylum seekers from both countries shortly its only going to get uglier for europe as time goes on and itd get worse if we got more involved i sympathize for everyone involved but frankly i do not care about russia i do not care about ukraine i barely care enough about my own survival yet im being asked to care about one side or another fuck everyone and everything that tells you how to feel thats on the internet man,phragmatic,16470814020,-6
i0dd1oh,tcdedn,So I dont understand what the Ukrainian government did in this case other than defend themselves I agree with the sentiment of concern for the people of both nations but if we compare the Ukrainian actions with the Russian actions we dont have an apples to apples thing If a bully starts beating someone up in school and that someone fights back yes both get in trouble for fighting I think that is bullshit too Lets not get so woke with our "for the people" circle jerk that we forget that there are governments on a whole different scale of asshole from other governments,smedley89,16470950050,0
i0dfu6d,tcdedn,I understand your sentiment so much suffering on both sides But Ukraine was invaded that is the difference Sadly the Russian people will suffer also because their leader is and insane narcissist But at least the Russians can sleep in their own beds and give birth in a hospital or drive down the street without worrying about being bombed The Russian people will suffer economically for years to come becuase of the action of their government but most will survive as will their countrys infrastructure The Russian people dont have to run in fear from their homes leaving everything sometimes even pets behind as they seek some sort of safety The Russian people dont have to flee on foot to other countries hoping someone will take pity on them and provide warmth food and shelter as they leave their sons and husbands behind Imagine those pregnant women in the hospital or the tiny babies in the NICU being rushed through rubble to a basement where nurses desperately try to keep them safe and alive with bombs dropping around them That is real terror Ukraine is being invaded and leveled only because one man wants the land But you are right in that both Ukrainian and Russian people are suffering but it is not equal levels of suffering Its ok to feel empathy and sadness for both no one is making you "love" one side and "hate" the other You can stand with Ukraine AND hate what Putin is doing to his own people I personally feel such pain for the Russians who have no idea whats going on and are losing access to money food even stuff that gets them through the day like McDonalds and video games Its not fair to the citizens Sanctions like that are meant to squeeze the citizens who would then put pressure on the government which in this case does not care one bit what happens to the millions of people they are tasked with looking after Its horrible and unfair to the Russians but Ukraine is not the one doing these things to the Russians Ukraine is simply trying to survive right now I think we can all agree that Putin and his corrupt government are the bad guy here yes? TL:DR: Its ok to feel sad for the citizens of both countries but there is clearly one Country who is the aggressor and one being mercilessly attacked But the average Russian citizen is not to blame and its ok to have empathy for them as well,thisistherightname,16470964080,1

It doesnt stop bullets It doesnt bring loved ones back and if I am being honest it doesnt put gas in anyones tankwellnot your average civilians anyway None of this gets remedied until those who are responsible are held accountable The problem with this is that 9 out of 10 times (if not more) we are dealing with "strawmen and figureheads" Those who create and control these catalysts arent celebrity politicians posing on mainstream media And this is why people get annoyed by this fluff It isnt bringing awareness It isnt exposing anything Its just "I have feelings" Great you have feelings Now what?,I_Am_Contrivance,16471066640,1

h6bceli,oq0kxg,For those that complain of capitalism or communism or what not the real issue is the kid raising system Lets pretend you want to be a millionaire by 30 In a college system with $100k of debt starting at 22 you basically need to earn around $150k per year after taxes and expenses to get to $1 Mil by 30 if investments go well etc (about doubling) Now remove college all together Instead of $150k you need like $90k Now imagine you take a kid and instead of the asinine question what do you want to do (all girls : animals community kids environment all boys : outdoor guy what my dad did) - and instead say what do you want to have This is what I do They always want a nice car vs shit car They want a happy spouse with kids vs alone and desperate They want to be able to afford medicines vs bothering family with a go fund me Its a relatively easy decision; lots of money better There are actually a LOT of careers that pay $90k without a degree Now if you plan for this you get them as an apprentice BUT ONLY for careers that pay $60k base and $200k tops like computers legal finance media & medical I had a dancing girlfriend that became a doctor simply by working at Walgreens She of course had no concept of what being a doctor was but after the pharmacist kept giving her money driving a nice car and invited her to her nice house - boom she became a doctor (internally) It was easy But more to the point I got this trailer kid that I sponsored over a few years who will be making $60k at 18 in computers - all I had to do was pay him $100 or so at a time for computer work here and there roughly what I would have paid someone else He *might* be a millionaire by 30 working full time in computers at 18 with what is normally referred to as the best resume theyve seen - and thats even when he slacked off (his dad gets him drunk weekly and his aunt keeps telling him to spend the next several years getting high and going to music shows thats what life is about!) - I did help him start his own business but he never did the professional networking meetings I suggested And the Key to all this? Benjamin Franklins Autobiography!!! Seriously!!! In it is a quick self study guide (13 virtues) to teach you to not be a dick Then there is the Junto system to make you network and listen to others and learn from them share with them in a constructive way And the final piece of the Benjamin Franklin system was to teach kids (nephews in his day) your skills when they were about 15 Then invest in them enough to start a shop (like $20K say) Then they pay you 50% of profits the next several years In Franklins system he went from poor as fuck to worker (18) - $30k (in todays money) - to extremely good worker living healthy connected and disciplined - shop manager (21) $60k - But the kicker at 32 he invested in 3 nephews basically This is where he made all his money Those nephews were also printers like him By 37 he was retired - and most of his inventions & political involvement happened after 37 (1740) And it was Franklin *the most* responsible for the AM Revolution cause he taught people how to make a fuck ton of money basically (and not to be assholes - EI self governing) Meh dribble but if you do something similar to what the Swiss do today where the average professional salary *is actually* $200000 then ALL of economics solves itself But they force kids into smart apprenticeship programs at 15 Thats the biggest difference The good kids are in professional clubs by 17 This is 100% normal Making $60k out of a Swiss high school is absolutely the norm and the reason the main reason they have such immense wealth Literally every nation could copy this approach and not take away from anyone else but we dont for whatever reason but you should do so with your kids always,Bitcoin1776,16270878610,1

h6azoh2,oq0kxg,No one takes out 200k at 17 most of the people taking out that much in student loans are in medical/pharmacy/veterinary school possibly Graduate programs And are therefore not 17 more like 22-23 at that point after bachelors Most of these people are making 100-200k a year after residency and can easily pay off their loan if they were disciplined and/or financially literate and is a great RoR on the money borrowed and will not have difficulty finding employment The people loaning know this A business loan is a lot more risky most small businesses go out of business is the sad reality Undergraduate loans are another beast but at the same time there is an element of personal responsibility to consider here You have the ability to choose where you go you dont have to pay 40k a year to go to a private college when you can go to a college that is just as good for 10k You can go to community college for the first 2 years and save tons of money You can live off campus and work to pay rent and food and gas you dont have to get a housing loan At the end of the day you have a lot of control over how much you choose to borrow you also have control over what major you study and understanding the job market and what businesses are looking for those skills how you can market in the job place So when people complain about their huge undergrad loans and cant find a job well Im not saying the system isnt broken but there is an element of personal responsibility objectivity and neutrality that I feel needs to be embedded into this discussion,MissionIll0,16270811450,-1

hhi7pzn,qcsqbl,reminds me of the time previous to the 2016 election when we saw a similar flavor of astroturfing There was a huge frontpage post titled something like "Former Trump supporters of reddit what was the final straw for you?" Meanwhile a low key protest was brewing behind the scenes where thousands literally thousands of users made identical posts "Former Hillary supporters of reddit what was the final straw for you?" The posts were absolutely flooding the new queue for like 12 hours but of course they were all rapidly being deleted as soon as they came in Anyone else remember this? I actually made this post myself completely unaware at the time it was happening because I thought the Trump post was such propagandistic bullshit that I felt compelled to act But after seeing people immediately crying fanatically for me to stop in my post replies and realizing what was going on I of course proceeded to flood the queue a few more times with a few dupe accounts This current account might even be one of those dupes Im too lazy to check Fun shit tho,Herpa_Derpa_Island,16348326620,4

If you mention Jesus or anything you shouldnt be a politician because you cannot make policies based in religion (like abortion) when most of the country isnt even religious anymore Its time for this to end Im cool with getting rid of both parties and starting over hell there are some really good things I think Republicans stand for I was a republican all throughout highschool and college But your party has lost its way and is letting a little handed man who likes to be peed on take over Its really sad and pathetic how much some Republicans worship him You do know once he dies the Republican party is pretty much done,forgotmyemail19,16348474830,-5

OPIUM WARS - The Original NARCO-COLONIALISM - The Original State Sponsored Drug TrafficStarting in in the mid-1700s the British began trading opium grown in India in exchange for silver from Chinese merchants Opium  an addictive drug that today is refined into heroin  was illegal in England but was used in Chinese traditional medicine 1 https://enwikipediaorg/wiki/Opium\_Wars https://enwikipediaorg/wiki/First\_Opium\_War https://enwikipediaorg/wiki/Second\_Opium\_War 2 This war with China really seems to me so wicked as to be a national sin of the greatest possible magnitude and it distresses me very deeply Cannot any thing be done by petition or otherwise to awaken mens minds to the dreadful guilt we are incurring? I really do not remember in any history of a war undertaken with such combined injustice and baseness Ordinary wars of conquest are to me far less wicked than to go to war in order to maintain smuggling and that smuggling consisting in the introduction of a demoralizing drug which the government of China wishes to keep out and which we for the lucre of gain want to introduce by force; and in this quarrel are going to burn and slay in the pride of our supposed superiority  Thomas Arnold to W W Hull March 18 1840 http://wwwvictorianweborg/history/empire/opiumwars/opiumwars1html 3 https://webarchiveorg/web/20180311121505/https://sacuorg/opium2html See also Opium in China In 1997 the colony of Hong Kong was returned to China Hong Kong Island became a British possession as a direct result of the Opium War the opening shots of which were fired 150 years ago All Chinese regardless of political ideology have condemned this armed confrontation as an unjust and immoral contest As far as they are concerned Britians waging a war for the sake of selling a poisonous drug constitutes the most shameful leaf of human history In the hindsight provided by subsequent events in China it is perhaps easy to condemn this act of British aggression but it is less certain that the event was seen in the same condemnatory light by Chinese and foreign observers a century and a half ago 4 Article on opium trade in 1920s Shanghai http://streetsofshanghaipbworkscom/w/page/18638691/Opium Opium (yapian ) Shanghai was built on the opium trade Before the 1850s Shanghai was the terminal port for coastal opium traffic Shanghai was opened to foreign trade on November 11th 1843 and very soon afterwards Jardines (the biggest British company in China at the time) set up a branch there and hired Chinese compradors one of whom was solely concerned with the supervision of opium By 1845 the opium moving through Shanghai constituted almost half of all the opium imported into China In 1880 nearly 13000000 pounds of opium came into China mainly from India By 1900 imports declined because China was now producing an average of 45000000 pounds of opium per annum itself There were at least 15000000 Chinese opium addicts  in Chengdu there was one opium den for every 67 inhabitants of the city In Shanghai some foreign missionaries began to complain that their homes were almost entirely surrounded by opium dens behind bamboo fences The city had more than eighty shops where the drug was sold openly in its crude form and there were over 1500 opium housesThe owners of these establishments bought their supplies from three major opium firms in the International Settlement  the Zhengxia Guoyu and Liwei All three were owned by Swatow (Chaozhou) merchants who formed a consortium This consortium obtained its opium from four foreign merchant houses: David Sassoon & Co ED Sassoon SJ David and Edward Ezra 5 Opium financed British rule in India http://newsbbccouk/2/hi/south\_asia/7460682stm What did you discover in the course of your research? How big was the trade? Opium steadily accounted for about 17-20% of Indian revenues If you think in those terms \[the fact that\] one single commodity accounted for such an enormous part of your economy is unbelievable extraordinary How and when did opium exports out of India to China begin? The idea of exporting opium to China started with Warren Hastings (the first governor general of British India) in 1780 The situation was eerily similar to \[what is happening\] today There was a huge balance of payments problem in relation to China China was exporting enormous amounts but wasnt interested in importing any European goods That was when Hastings came up with idea that the only way of balancing trade was to export opium to China,shylock92008,16270047200,2
h67hnxn,opbmcz,IS ANYONE APOLOGIZING TO GARY WEBB? by Michael Levine (DEA-RET) Gary Webb just in case youve already forgotten him was the journalist who in a well researched understated article entitled "The Dark Alliance" linked the CIA supported Contras to cocaine and weapons being sold to a California street gang and ended up literally being hounded out of journalism by every mainstream news peddling organization in the Yellow Pages Even his own employer The San Jose Mercury piled on for the kill And guess what? The CIA finally admitted yesterday in the New York Times no less that they in fact did "work with" the Nicaraguan Contras while they had information that they were involved in cocaine trafficking to the United States An action known to us court qualified experts and federal agents as Conspiracy to Import and Distribute Cocainea federal felony punishable by up to life in prison To illustrate how us regular walking around non CIA types are treated when we violate this law while I was serving as a DEA supervisor in New York City I put two New York City police officers in a federal prison for Conspiracy to distribute Cocaine when they looked the other way at their friends drug dealing We could not prove they earned a nickel nor that they helped their friend in any way they merely did not do their duty by reporting him They were sentenced to 10 and 12 years respectively and one of them I was recently told had committed suicide I have spent three decades as a court qualified expert and federal agent and am not aware of any class of American Citizen having special permission to violate the law that we have been taxed over $1 trillion in the past two decades to enforce; the law that every politician bureaucrat and media pundit keeps telling us protects us against the most serious danger to American security in our historyThe interesting thing to me about the Webb article is that the CIA is provably (and now admittedly) responsible for much larger scale drug trafficking than Webb alleged or even imagined in his report In fact according to a confidential DEA report entitled "Operation Hun a Chronology" that I used as part of the proof to back up the undercover experiences detailed in my book The Big White Lie (optioned for a movie by Robert Greenwald Productions) the CIA was actively blocking DEA from indicting many members of the ruling government of Bolivia from 1980-83during a time period that these same people were responsible for producing more than 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States As CIA Inspector General Hitz himself stated before congress it was during this time period that Nicaraguan Contra supporters were buying large amounts of cocaine from these same CIA protected Bolivians Do you think Congress wants to see this proof? The gang that cant spy straight as they are known to my listeners and about whom President Lyndon Johnson once said "When Rich folks dont trust their sons with the family money they send them on down to the CIA" certainly did a lot more damage to this nation than for example computer company owner Will Foster who was sentenced to 93 years in prison for possession of 70 marijuana plants for medicinal use Of course true to their shifty sleazy form while admitting that they did aid and abet Contra drug trafficking they are now refusing to release their own final investigative report which details the damning proof The same report that CIA Inspector General Fredrick Hitz during February 1998 had promised congress and the American people was forthcoming "shortly" because as CIA Director George Tenet now claims CIA does not have enough money in its budget to properly classify it You believe that then I know an old guy with a beard named Fidel wandering the streets of South Miami with an Island about 90 miles off the coast for sale He says the money is for his retirement How you ask do they get away with it? Well for one thing mainstream media the so-called Fourth Estate does all it can to help During the Iran-contra hearings when Senators Kerry and Damato were making pronouncements before the Senate indicating that the CIA was involved with drug trafficking Katherine Graham the owner of The Washington Post addressed a class of CIA recruits at CIAs Langley headquarters in November 1988 by saying: "There are some things the general public does not need to know and shouldnt I believe democracy flourishes when the government can take legitimate steps to keep its secrets and when the press can decide whether to print what it knows" Apparently CIA protection of drug trafficking was among those secrets Thus it should have been no surprise to those CIA agent recruits when Washington Post reporter and drug expert Michael Itsikoff wrote that there was "no credible evidence" linking the CIA supported contras to cocaine trafficking at the same time very credible evidence was being heard by Senator Kerrys committee indicating that the Contras may have been the top purveyors of drugs to Americans in our historyNeither should it have been a surprise to anyone who heard her statement when mainstream media refused to print the news that Oliver North US Ambassador to Costa Rica Lewis Tambs and various top level CIA officers were banned from ever entering Costa Rica by Nobel Prize winning President Oscar Arias for drug running The drugs by the way all going to us Nor should it have been a surprise when Gary Webb was destroyed by mainstream media for doing nothing more or less than telling the truth as he found it And now while CIA admits their felonies to the press but refuses to release the proof and Janet Reno the head of the Obstruction of Justice Department has done the unprecedented by classifying her own departments investigation into CIA drug trafficking the partnership for a Drug Free America is spending $2 billion of our tax money on already-proven-fruitless anti-drug ads And where do you think the money goes?

I mean we dont have to tell on them do we? Attorney General: Of course not! Well you did But I just changed the law Dont worry about it CIA Chief: Gee thanks!

According to Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif) who is calling for full disclosure of the facts "The CIA knew that the Contras were dealing drugs They made this deal with the Attorney General to protect themselves from having to report it" Some of the remaining questions may still be answered The Department of Justice and the CIA have finished separate investigations into possible CIA involvement in drug smuggling But neither report has been made available to the public; the Justice department cites an "ongoing investigation" while the CIA says their report is an internal document and therefore classified Says Congresswoman Waters: "What is it they dont want Americans to see?

h674p5o,opbmcz,1998: CIA Says It Used Nicaraguan Rebels Accused of Drug Tie; By James Risen July 17 1998 ; "The agencys decision to keep those paid agents or to continue dealing with them in some less formal relationship was made by top officials at headquarters in Langley Va" - NYT  https://wwwnytimescom/1998/07/17/world/cia-says-it-used-nicaraguan-rebels-accused-of-drug-tiehtml CIA Says It Used Nicaraguan Rebels Accused of Drug Tie By James Risen July 17 1998 The Central Intelligence Agency continued to work with about two dozen Nicaraguan rebels and their supporters during the 1980s despite allegations that they were trafficking in drugs according to a classified study by the CIA The new study has found that the agencys decision to keep those paid agents or to continue dealing with them in some less formal relationship was made by top officials at headquarters in Langley Va in the midst of the war waged by the CIA-backed contras against Nicaraguas leftist Sandinista Government The new report by the CIAs inspector general criticizes agency officials actions at the time for the inconsistent and sometimes sloppy manner in which they investigated -- or chose not to investigate -- the allegations which were never substantiated by the agency The inspector generals report which has not yet been publicly released also concludes that there is no evidence that any CIA officials were involved in drug trafficking with contra figures The fundamental finding of the report is that there is no information that the CIA or CIA employees ever conspired with any contra organizations or individuals involved with the contras for purposes of drug trafficking a United States intelligence official said The new report is the long-delayed second volume of the CIAs internal investigation into possible connections between the contras and Central American drug traffickers The investigation was originally prompted by a 1996 series in The San Jose Mercury-News which asserted that a dark alliance between the CIA the contras and drug traffickers had helped finance the contra war with profits from drug smuggling The second volume dismisses those specific charges as did the first volume released in January The series charged that the alliance created a drug trafficking network that introduced crack cocaine into South Central Los Angeles It prompted an enormous outcry especially among blacks many of whom said they saw it as confirmation of a Government-backed conspiracy to keep blacks dependent and impoverished The Mercury-News subsequently admitted that the series was flawed and reassigned the reporter In the declassified version of the CIAs first volume the agency said the Mercury-News charges were baseless and mentioned drug dealers who had nothing to do with the CIA But John M Deutch the Director of Central Intelligence at the time had also asked the inspector general to conduct a broader inquiry to answer unresolved questions about the contra program and drug trafficking that had not been raised by The Mercury-News Frederick Hitz then the CIAs inspector general decided to issue a second larger report to deal with those broader issues Many allegations in the second volume track closely with charges that first surfaced in a 1987 Senate investigation The CIA is reluctant to release the complete 500-page second volume because it deals directly with contras the agency did work with According to the report CIA officials involved in the contra program were so focused on the fight against the Sandinistas that they gave relatively low priority to collecting information about the possible drug involvement of contra rebels The report concluded that CIA officers did report on drug trafficking by the contras but that there were no clear guidelines given to field officers about how intensively they should investigate or act upon the allegations In all the CIA received allegations of drug involvement against about 50 contras or supporters during the war against the Sandinistas the report said Some of the allegations may have been specious the result of Sandinista propaganda American intelligence officials said It could not be determined from the CIAs records how many of the 50 cases were fully investigated But the agency continued to work with about two dozen of the 50 contras according to American intelligence officials familiar with the report They said the report had found that the agency was unable to either prove or disprove the charges or did not investigate them adequately American intelligence officials who provided information about the report declined to identify the individual contras who were the subjects of the drug allegations But they did say that in addition to individual cases the report found that drug allegations had been made against one contra organization a group known as 15th of September That group was formed in 1980 and was disbanded in January 1982 The CIAs decision to classify this second volume has already been met with criticism in Congress Senator John Kerry Democrat of Massachusetts who led a 1987 Congressional inquiry into allegations of contra drug connections wrote a letter Thursday to the Director of Central Intelligence George J Tenet asking that the report be immediately declassified Mr Kerry who has reviewed the second volume of the inspector generals report said he believed that CIA officials involved in the contra program did not make a serious effort to fully investigate the allegations of drug involvement by the contras Some of us in Congress at the time in 1985 1986 were calling for a serious investigation of the charges and CIA officials did not join in that effort Mr Kerry said There was a significant amount of stonewalling Im afraid that what I read in the report documents the degree to which there was a lack of interest in making sure the laws were being upheld A version of this article appears in print on July 17 1998 Section A Page 2 of the National edition

I t is now clear that this agreement began with the events described in THE BIG WHITE LIE; that the top drug traffickers in Bolivia then supplying virtually all the worlds cocaine-including Sonia Atala-were CIA assets that had to be protected from our deep cover probe Laura and I still have the proof of this that we used to back up the publication THE BIG WHITE LIE The same proof was later incorporated into other data backing up the publications of DEEP COVER and TRIANGLE OF DEATH [https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/](https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/) Our evidence-which congress has been craning its neck not to see- for instance shows clearly that during Operation Hun (the story in The Big White Lie) secret meetings were held with CIA and Justice Department wherein all indictments of top government officials in Bolivia were blocked We now believe this agreement began because of Operation Hun CIA had to hide the fact that they were supporting the people manufacturing virtually all the cocaine being produced in the world at that time In Deep Cover we showed that during Operation Trifecta-a highly successful deep cover probe into the top of the drug world in three countries (Panama Bolivia and Mexico) -Attorney General of the US Ed Meese found it necessary to warn the Attorney General of Mexico about DEAs case We (undercover DEA agents and Customs agents) found links between top US government officials and the people who murdered DEA agent Kiki Camarena that to this day go unexamined by our congress or anyone else In "TRIANGLE OF DEATH a work of "faction" we showed CIAs real-life involvement in the protection and creation of one of the most murderous criminal organizations to ever plague America an organization created by escaped Nazi fugitives under CIA protection-events occurring long before this alleged CIA Justice agreement And so the dance continues If anyone watched the CNN show you cannot have helped but notice the snickering on the part of Congressional chairman Porter Goss (an ex CIA officer) as congresswoman Maxine Waters spoke Now heres the reason why: Sources of mine who speak to me from inside this veil of secrecy out of conscience and because I am cheaper and more reliable than a psychiatrist have already told me the following: There is secret communication between CIA and members of the Congressional staff-one must keep in mind that Porter Goss the chairman is an ex CIA official- indicating that the whole hearing is just a smoke and mirror show so that the American people-particularly the Black community- can "blow off some steam" without doing any damage to CIA The CIA has been assured that nothing real will be done other than some embarrassing questions being asked That the hearings will result in the CIA receiving even a larger budget than the current $26 billion that they admit to One of the most distressing things for me a 25 year veteran of this business to listen to was when Congresswoman Waters said that the hearings were not about CIA officers being indicted and going to jail "That is not going to happen" she said Almost in the same breath she spoke of a recent case in Miami wherein a Venezuelan National Guard general was caught by Customs agents smuggling more than a ton of cocaine into the US Despite named CIA officers being involved in the plot as Congresswoman Waters stated the Justice Department will not tell her anything about the case because of "secrecy laws" No wonder chairman Goss was snickering She could not have played more neatly into CIA hands than to surrender before the battle was engaged For the entire existence of CIA they have gotten away with doing more damage to the American people than all our traditional enemies combined precisely because no one was ever prosecuted From the CIA protection of Nazi criminals from war crimes prosecution as they set up criminal organizations that preyed on America (Triangle of Death) to their lies to President Kennedy that dragged us into Bay of Pigs to their lies to President Johnson that dragged us into the Vietnam War to their creation of a pan Arab army of American hating drug trafficking terrorists during the Afghan War to the Church Commission hearings to MK-Ultra to the Bolivian Cocaine Coup ("The Big White Lie") to their protection of the worlds top cocaine traffickers as they laid waste to American streets (Deep cover) the CIA has acted exactly as Senator Frank Church once described them: "a runaway rogue elephantcompletely unresponsive to Congressthey (the CIA) have not only been unproductive they have been contra productive they have brought great shame on America" And the dance continues &#x200B; &#x200B; https://npredditcom/r/NarcoFootage/comments/nthcsy/dea6\_by\_dea\_hector\_berrellez\_wayne\_schmidt\_opr/ The KIKI Camarena murder was tied to the use of US intelligence using drug cartel ranches for Contra military training AND Contra/DOD/NSC/Oliver North drug smuggling ring at the same time MEREX Corp supplied arms and other items to the cartel/ It was owned by a Ex Nazi CIA agent named Gerhard Mertins the company also employed Klaus Barbie,shylock92008,16270103370,1

hw32nkr,snj9i6,When people say the seatbelt analogy (I usually hear it used as analogy for masks) I reverse it on them  yeah its exactly like a seatbelt A seatbelt made of soggy tissue paper you must now keep strapped on at all times Even when youre not in a vehicle even when youre nowhere near another human And you wear it strapped over your face forever That seems to end the argument lol,__MEOWFACE__,16443305670,-1
hw35c1p,snj9i6,Heres a better analogy: Look at the vaccination as street heroine It makes your pain go away temporarily causes terrible health impacts if you do it a lot and probably wont kill you the first time you take it That means that we should force unwilling people to take the drugs because it makes us feel smarter for willingly taking the drugs!,Mankowitz-,16443317260,1
hw32v4b,snj9i6,Wearing a seatbelt is the law Its in place bc wearing a seatbelt can save lives There are lots of laws in place to protect peoples health Seatbelts no smoking inside no drunk driving you need a license to operate heavy machinery cars need to be inspected before they can drive on the road OSHA rules and regulations expiration dates on food and on and on Do all these laws keep people safe 100% of the time- nope Do these laws save millions of lives every year- yes Please look up the information on vaccine side effects throughout history Its negligible compared to their effectiveness for saving lives What exactly are yall gonna say down the road when all vaccinated are fine and we havent been implanted with a disease or 5g chip?

hw497h0,snj9i6,You seem misinformed on the vaccine in general The reason comparing a seatbelt to the vaccine is an analogy is because its similar in some ways but the two are not exactly same And you must remember the context the seatbelt analogy is often brought up as an answer to "why do I need to wear a mask if I already have a vaccine" the answer of course being that we wear seatbelts as well as airbags because we want to improve our chances of not only not passing it on but also not dying You also seem to think that the risk of blood clots in the vaccine are bad would it surprise you to know that the coronavirus as a much much (x10) higher chance of blood clots "necrological disorders" and all manor of other side effects? You also seem to think theyre are some secret "long term results" were still waiting for but this is a strange thought No vaccine before has ever been present in the body for more than 6 months at the absolute most Vaccines as you know are there to train the immune system and dont stay in the body long usually around a month or less With 2 billion+ doses administered we still have no addition side effects so it seems strange to wait for these Covid on the other hand seems very capable of permanently damaging a lot of lung ear nose and throat systems with long term effects like difficult breathing lung capacity smell and taste and many more just being permanently changed Im not sure what "hiding the safety data" the cdc and all the drug agencies have been very forthcoming on all their trials You all even got mad at the cdc for saying there was no evidence of airborne contagion early on and then changing that stance after they researched it and got evidence Same thing with when they said dont wear masks at first as they were no thought at the time to be necessary but new data came out and the cdc adapted its message to the studies The cdc has been reflective of the data from the begining You might be talking about the preprint studies and the VAERS database stuff Those Im sure you have heard are flawed for many reasons their results may be correct or not but we need more data before we can say anything If the researchers and doctors at the head of the preprints or VAERS claims believed that they would want to wait for these studies But we did this cycle with monocoidal antibodies ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine and each time they put in the work for a big double blind study these drugs are reveal to do nothing or so little as to be nothing You also seem very concerned about the companies themselves but for all your conspiracy you dont look at the positives These companies are looking to make big money from government contracts and to get the biggest ones you need an effective vaccine as verified by the FDA and the 40 other countries the vaccine will go too including France Britain Germany and even our enemies China and Russia It in their best interest to make a working vaccine especially because they must compete in a hot market theyre now like 7 different vaccines from different companies so competition is fierce I mean just ask yourself if the vaccine was truly dangerous why wouldnt Russia or China talk about it Or the hundreds of journalists looking for hot stories or any of our allied countries to alter their friends or peoples or the competing companies after their government contract All these people and more would have to work together its impossible,rascalrhett1,16443466010,-4
hw378p6,snj9i6,This is completely missing the primary point of when most people are bringing up the seatbelt analogy Yes some people bring it up as a pure example of a mandated safety rule But the primary point of the seatbelt analogy is in explaining to people how a vaccine can be working but that the majority of people in some places who are hospitalized are vaccinated Thats because the ratios matter The analogy then is to how seatbelts work to reduce risk in crashes but far more people end up in hospitals from car crashes who were wearing seatbelts than who werent because almost everyone wears a seatbelt The only other context the seatbelts are sometimes used is analogous to masks and then the analogy works pretty well even in the use-case So this primarily seems to be an argument being directed at what is fundamentally a misunderstanding of the main reason seatbelts get mentioned,JoshuaZ1,16443325170,-7

hw75us4,snj9i6,I cant account for everytime somebody has used this as an analogy but the way I use it is as an error of inference Lets take a quote: "but you dont know if the vaccine is gonna save YOU" it would be like saying "but we dont know wether seatbelts actually work until it does" Yes we do because the statistics shows that hospitalization and deaths are much more likely to happen to unvaccinated Or simply using anecdotes "People I know got survived perfectly fine from covid" you would stop using seatbelts because somebody you know who survived without a seatbelt because statistically people actually survive using seatbelts all the time This is how I use it to point out errors in conclusions,EddyEdmund,16443924310,1

The old lady gave him an eerie look and responded: "Plague is my name and it is my turn visiting your city" "How many will you take with you this time?" asked the priest "Few only one thousand" the plague responded After a week( and meanwhile having informed for the situation in his city) the priest was returning and in the entrance of the city he encountered the plague that was leaving "You lied to me" he said " You told me that you will take with you one thousand and yet you killed five thousand" And she responded: " I didnt lie I only took one thousand The rest were killed by stress and fear",supernatural1789,16414219620,2

hrfghyd,rwkj3w,The worst is yet to come My religion (Orthodox) had prophecies about this and so far around 8-9 of them came true (theres more but they are some smaller ones so I wouldnt mention them) The one that is yet to come true is the one saying "once the humanity is at the point of not knowing what to do as times are getting worse and no solutions are to be found antichrist will appear with a solution" (I tried to translate it as best as I could) Vaccines are proving as failing which is exactly what they want The time will come when they will say publicly that they no longer know what to do and how to deal with the pandemic Thats when a *certain person* will appear with a "solution" to end all problems and he will be throned in UN as the humanitys saviour I made this as brief as I could as it is rather complex and in order to truly understand and believe all this youd need to know a lot of backstory Another huge one said that "there will be a global pandemic before the end" (This one was told about 200-300 years ago iirc) We live in the end times sadly You may or may not believe me but Ive been following advices that my religion told me due to these prophecies and I havent regretted a single decision I made thus far Ive simply been following prophecies and what they tell us to do and Im making it work Havent and wont take the vax as I know what it is leading towards,HRCK0,16414291920,2

Im fully vaccinated and yeah it does piss me off that I might have to wear masks again because of a bunch of idiots that refuse to get the shot so we can all move on from this I went into a store yesterday that had a sign on the door "face masks required for everyone" so I had to go back to my car just to find one as Ive gotten used to not wearing them anymore Well when I went into the store this man and his son were in there not wearing a mask Unless they start really ENFORCING the masks (which I think it would be nice if businesses/whenever else would require proof of vaccination if you have it you dont have to wear a mask if you dont mask on or no entry) we are going to be stuck in this cycle for even longer Lots of people are never going to wear the mask or take the shot willingly Im hoping we eventually get to a vaccine mandate Im just frustrated like lots of people that I did my part wearing a mask for over a year and a half (even after I was fully vaccinated for a while) and then there are people that are just ruining it for us,dirty-little-hearts,16278511820,30

Not asking the population to DECENTRALIZE when this would take many mouths out of the system and leave humans to be self sufficient?

h7chiil,ovpxdj,This is about "normalcy" and not about covid Normalcy is basically flipping our planet so a few people can get rich and leave this earth as they are demonstrating as I write Everyone just wants to have whatever they want while only caring about the generation in their family that follows them Its a disfunctional society and we use pop culture to put ourselves in a docile state where we cant be conscious of what the future impact will be Normalcy is just a bunch of rich men fulfilling their destiny to colonize to other planets because theres not much to colonize here anymore While the "normal" people just do everything possible to take care of their immediate family but when it comes to 2 generations of family that you wont know it doesnt matter if they live Because having a family and a stable job is only relevant up until we are forced otherwise because we didnt do anything to stop the 6th mass extinction on this planet Except the only ones not going extinct are the worst people They get to do this to another planet of people Its disgusting how we have objections with people not wanting to get needles but we have no problem with capitalism taking over 70% of our earnings and bending us over whenever theres a crisis Like what is more relevant - the future of 20 terrible people or the future of all of people At this point I hope we all fucking die because nobody can see the real problem We have come so far in time just to throw it all away for people thinking their clever when really we need wisdom We are capable of being logical but most of us are consciously primitive,VCEQ,16278463510,1

gunjngl,mrcrm8,What really fucking annoys me in many of the answers here is *only* comparing blood clot (or rather CVT / "brain clots") risk between Covid and AZ/vaccines Instead of mortality / side effects / long term effects (off both) in general Yes AZ might have a higher risk of CVTs than Pfizer/Biontech and yes it might "only be n times less than the risk of those from Covid"  but Covid can cause death / hospitalization / long term lung or neural damage / "Long Covid" / watever IN ADDITION to blood clots / CVTs And yep even in "the young and healthy" (although with lower probability than in the elderly / other groups at risk  but still quite a bit) Sounds really fucking short-sighted thinking to me Yeah it might be best if everyone would get "the good vaccine" but not everyone can (ask Europe or even better ask "poorer countries) and in really the very most cases even "the bad one" sooner is still much better than getting Covid and dying from blood clots or any of the other many ways it can kill you  or suffering from any of the long term effects On top of that: Getting yourself vaccinated sooner does not only protect your individual sorry corpse it also protects others by reducing potential for further spread (and mutations) and of course protecting those who cannot get vaccinated or whose immune system cannot build as effective an immune response with the vaccine ("vaccine non responders" is the term iirc) What Im saying is: no its not just "AZ clots vs Covid clots vs Biontech clots",spurious_signal,16185227240,1
gunnmtr,mrcrm8,The risk assessment problem you run into is whether youre also eight times more likely to get COVID if you wait for the vaccine Unfortunately theres plenty of people who think theyre just going to sit on the sideline and not get COVID while everyone else gets vaccinated and the case count drops or perhaps a middle path where they wait for the MRNA vaccine Though SUPER anecdotal I was literally taking care of a male patient who received the Pfizer vaccine 2 days ago and had the sinus thrombus I highly suspect that these are much more common and much more benign than we had previously known absent more data to prove a stronger case,hiricinee,16185245950,1

guotxn9,mrcrm8,There was a good article somewhere about how to assess these risks at a more personal level Like the chances of bad outcomes from these things varies with stuff like age and certain pre-existing conditions along with the general community transmission rates of covid So for this headline here you would need to compare also "what are my chances of getting covid *at all*?" against the choice of vaccine If the chances of getting covid are very very low (maybe you live on an island off NZ or something) then it might make sense to avoid AstraZeneca since in your circumstances your chances of having *any* negative outcome from covid are very very very low compared with a very very low chance of negative outcome from AstraZeneca At the public health level different countries have already taken different reactions based on their particular circumstances For instance if you have a fairly dense population and are high income country and have access to something like the BioNTech vaccine then you might take the approach of abandoning AstraZeneca entirely If you are at the other extreme low income poorly developed health infrastructure lots of people long travel times from population centres you probably will press ahead with AstraZeneca and similar vaccines because of its advantages and accept that you will have some small number of complications or deaths because it is far smaller number of deaths from the much slower more expensive difficult roll out of different vaccines,FartHeadTony,16185472640,1

The intricacies of the vaccine dangers and complex statistics deserve more credit than just "vaccine sideffects are negligible and therefore should be ignored" When you consider that: - the vaccine does not fully prevent infection and transmission and its in question still just how often it breaks through - the % of the population that cant have the vaccine is very small - the % of them who actually catch the virus is small when the R rate is suppressed and cases are driven down - the % of them who get the virus who couldnt have the vaccine who later are hospitalised or die is also very small (though immune suppressive comorbidities do bring this up a little) - variants are likely to be imported from other countries with higher case rates as opposed to arising domestically - in the case of a vaccine-dodging variant youre back to square one anyway You realise thats its a complex issue with many factors and the balance of probability is not clear or indeed not yet known And yes the vaccine does have rare but relevant and potentially lethal side effects https://amptheguardiancom/world/2021/sep/10/boys-more-at-risk-from-pfizer-jab-side-effect-than-covid-suggests-study For the courts to enforce such a mandate with so many factors and limited and disputed evidence in relation to them it seems a little problematic for them to make a judgement call at the cost of peoples bodily autonomy,meluvyouelontime,16324441090,-3

hc8f8x0,pl59ch,Pros: More vaccinated = fewer hospitals overloaded Cons: more people quitting jobs to avoid the vaccine While the increased vaccination rate should slow the spread and decrease the number of hospitalizations thereby decreasing the unsustainable load on our failing healthcare system this move may also trigger a wave of resignations from the workforce at a time when labor is already in short supply Diregarding for a moment the arguments around freedom of choice and the role of government in our lives the question is: will this mandate have a net positive effect on our society? Does the anticipated decrease in hospitalizations outweigh the potential decrease in the labor force? Consider also the compounding effects of a labor shortage ( yes I know its actually a wage shortage) on the already fractured supply chain Additionally how much benefit will we actually see from this mandate if (when) a vaccine resistant variant of covid begins to dominate? Im asking because I dont know the answer not because Im hinting or suggesting one way or the other I would appreciate thoughts and insights on the subject,SirNicksAlong,16312238980,8
hc92k83,pl59ch,This doesnt solve anything it only promotes more propaganda Even if youre fully vaccinated and do all of the right things you can certainly get infected and be transmissible Its definitely not just the unvaccinated who are spreading this And while were at this the single biggest vax demographic thats reluctant to get the jabs are the African American community (just around 40% have been vaxxed White 50% Asiatic 67%) So he basically just told them all that he was going to take their jobs if they dont submit to the orders of an old white man surrounded by whites and if they dont comply theyll even lose their healthcare Meanwhile they are adding thousands of people into the mix from Afghanistan and lets not forget the practically open southern border where MANY of those caught crossing are testing positive for covid This administration is fuckawful I can tell you something With him creating even more of a divisive stance in this country it will only lead to further division Certainly no one who has been anti vax or even vaccine hesitant is going to listen to this "message" and think you know now Im gonna forget my previous stance and get the jab In fact given recent global events and the lies that have been perpetuated of day that trust in our government locally or globally is at an all time low I predict this will be challenged very quickly with the courts,Posthumos1,16312344230,16

The answer is yes The scientific community has spoken and weve had a general consensus about the validity and effectiveness of vaccines for decades Yes with anything medically related there are always risks involved but anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers are being completely disingenuous about those risks Millions and millions of people for decades have taken all sorts of vaccinations and lived side-effect free Vaccines have been mandatory for things like public schools for **decades** Censoring this type of bullshit content isnt an indicator that were living in this liberal dystopian future that a good amount of these anti-vaxxers seem to think were living in Its basically tantamount to removing those videos where idiots were dying from eating those detergent pods Weve 100% reached a point were we know that anti-vaccine beliefs are wrong Enabling people to continue to put out factually misleading content about vaccines is basically like promoting that drinking bleach is good for you This type of censorship whether you believe it or not is 100% for the greater good Anti-vaxxers are wrong If you believe that vaccines are some sort of liberal conspiracy perpetrated by the deep state lizard people you should be in a mental institution I ultimately feel bad for everyone who has fallen pray to bullshit conspiracy theories and are the victims of a poor public education system but now the health and wellbeing of my family and myself are at risk and its time to put an end to these dangerous beliefs Take away their ability to communicate with the masses and allow them to find some niche piece of the internet where they can be in their echo chamber in peace without risking spreading their misinformation to the rest of us,chadstark89,16329392940,-1

hpjxe0s,rm4ymn,**Omicron Has 80% Lower Risk of Hospitalization New Study Shows** * Once admitted risk of severe disease is the same: NICD data * Compared to delta odds of severe omicron disease is 70% lower South Africans contracting Covid-19 in the current fourth wave of infections are 80% less likely to be hospitalized if they catch the omicron variant compared with other strains according to a study released by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases Once admitted to the hospital the risk of severe disease doesnt differ from other variants the authors led by scientists Nicole Walter and Cheryl Cohen said Compared to delta infections in South Africa between April and November omicron infections are associated with a 70% lower risk of severe disease they said The omicron data was collected for the two months through November Since being identified by South African scientists on Nov 25 the omicron variant has fueled record case numbers across the country Africas most developed economy has fully inoculated about 44% of its adult population over a seven-month period &#x200B; In the data that are being submitted to a preprint medical publication -- MedRxiv -- the authors adjusted for various confounding factors that could influence the results including age gender and whether the cases were known reinfections For severity of disease after admission they also adjusted for the presence of other illnesses and prior immunization The study also showed that those with omicron may have higher viral loads The study is "important" though its use of so-called historic controls when comparing to the delta infections between April and November means its outcome may be biased by time issues said Paul Hunter a professor of medicine at the UKs University of East Anglia "So even though cases of omicron were less likely to end up in hospital than cases of delta it is not possible to say whether this is due to inherent differences in virulence or whether this is due to higher population immunity in November compared to earlier in the year" Hunter said The authors flagged the same limitations,b3atballs,16401793260,233

hpmkad4,rm4ymn,TIL that care standards vary greatly There are massive discrepancies in standard hospitalization procedures across states and likely internationally It seems that people dont know what they should be asking because COVID isnt respiratory Its a vascular disease caused by antibodies overreacting and attacking a protein in your blood causing clots The virus enters through lung cells so the clots start there At least up until omicron Standard care should almost immediately involve some level of heparin to start and remdesivir In most cases this is enough Worse cases may require dexamethasone to calm the immune system Oxygen should usually be used Most hospitalized should be out of the hospital quickly Monoclonal antibodies worked very well on Delta too But what you dont here is that you shouldnt wait If you have a fever for more than 2 days after testing positive and your chest gets tight look for a monoclonal site If the monitors tell you to go the hospital then you go Keep the hospitals clear dont take medical hooey and understand that time is of the essence,Walternotwalter,16402200280,2

hpnsgrm,rm4ymn,It is far more contagious so if it infects more than 5 times as many people then its more deadly Until we know more banking on the fact it is not as deadly is the same logical fallacy that people were making at the start of the pandemic when they were saying "its only a 2% chance of dying from it" The only certainty from this pandemic is that people seemed destined to learn nothing,Alienturnedhuman,16402469450,2
hpofslc,rm4ymn,Whereas Imperial College London suggests far higher risk Know which one I trust Transmission is also far higher and the virus somewhat immune to vaccines because of its Massively higher infection rates in upper respiratory tracts (lower rates than delta on lower tract - hence lower hospitalization and death) Too many studies underpaying the effects of Omicron if I am twenty times more likely to catch it than delta but only ten times less likely to die if I do my overall odds of dying far worse,Historical_Job_8609,16402647890,2

hpl3thq,rm4ymn,This is good But until we know about the postacute effects Ill pass on risking exposure That mild symptom cases are still showing long term effects neurological cardiac pulmonary this is a bigger concern and has been for me even with the relatively low mortality of the virus (still way too high) prior to omicron variants https://wwwnytimescom/2021/03/23/health/long-covid-symptomshtml https://wwwcdcgov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/indexhtml While the omicron may result in fewer deaths it may also placate people into more risky behaviors concerning the virus I just dont want to see a decade pass and then we find we have a large segment of the population incapacitated,robeph,16401977700,0
hpm2cwu,rm4ymn,My personal Logic chain: 1 Delta infections are largely constrained to unvaccinated and non-seroconversion survivors 2 Omicron bypassing both forms of infection immunity but not severe disease immunity Neutralising antibodies vs adaptive immunity 3 Therefore the infected cohort with Omicron is unique in that it contains a high percentage of people with prior exposure and active adaptive immune response Also skewed in that previous infection waves have already removed the more vulnerable from the potential patient pool 4 That cohort needs to be differentiated when looking at Omicron disease severity Even if hospitalisations are lower than other variants were (absent lockdown) potentially going to see a lot of people sick in a very short period of time,GuvnzNZ,16402118750,0
hpkilbg,rm4ymn,Id like to point out that its not clear if this is a property of the variant or a result of having a population seroprevalence of ~80% It may be a bit of both The only way to find out would be to look at unvaccinated people who have never been infected with any variant and examine their hospitalization risk This is a small population at this point But while Ive raised a biologically interesting question the reality is that this wave isnt generating the hospitalization surge that we saw before The hospitalizations need to drive the policies not purple lines on test cards not PCR results with a Ct value of 39 Now I would like everyone to be aware that prior to 2020 hospitals would get overwhelmed with respiratory virus patients *every winter* A lot of these were flu but also RSV metapneumovirus parainfluenzavirus rhinovirus and even endemic coronaviruses So we are going to need to start seriously re-examining our response to this virus We need policy that makes sense for the vaccinated and it may be time to start doing some serious triaging for those who refuse to be vaccinated,MikeGinnyMD,16401891890,1

hpkk2zy,rm4ymn,One interesting caveat - according to the abstract of the pre-print article those hospitalized had roughly the same severity between delta and omicron comparing cases in the same time period whereas comparing delta in an earlier time period hospitalized patients had less severe disease more recently https://wwwmedrxivorg/content/101101/2021122121268116v1 One possible explanation is that unvaccinated/unexposed individuals are still getting really sick but there are less of them now,jpk195,16401898050,1

gzvqvfo,nniy3y,Ima set aside the stupidity of this and simply remind everyone that any mandate your employer wants to implement must be applied to uniformly to everyone for it to be legal &#x200B; For example if your company threatens to fire you for being unvaccinated; they must also fire every unvaccinated full time employee that has been working there for years (**employees whom the company has already invested allot of time and money in training**) If they cherry pick just you then that is discrimination &#x200B; In typical media fashion allot of articles try to place shift the blame onto the individual as if claiming "If YOU dont get the vaccine YOU will face the consequences of not being allowed to work"; when in really the language of these laws is tailored to the employers choice not the employee and should instead be reported as "If WE want to hinder our hiring pool to only vaccinated people we will" **You (the individual employee) are not choosing to be unemployed for not being vaccinated your boss is choosing to fire you** So no need to worry about whether they can or cant mandate this They wont do it because it will for certain cause a labor shortage to them and potentially a discrimination lawsuit if they use it as a reason to fire only the employees they dont like &#x200B; ps: if youre going to post the dumbass response of "many employers already mandate it hurr hurr hurr"; please enlighten us and list specifically which ones Yea Yea Yea you read some article saying that companies are going to do it Name then tell us specifically which companies are right now mandating the vaccine and have fired or are otherwise threatening to fire unvaccinated employees,AbortedBaconFetus,16223037430,3

Probably not no As far as I can tell my immune system removes it within around 24 hours of me getting it I can usually tell by being extremely tired and having heat in my nose as some of the onset covid symptoms Anyways its sad to see people prioritize herd immunity over vaccinating the individuals that need it Immunocompromised individuals are another conversation but they are an extreme minority,obliviron,16223079530,0
gzvm272,nniy3y,I work for a hospital system and we have been discussing this from the very beginning This guidance from the EEOC makes mandates possible for employers to require the vaccine It removes the legal challenge hurdles that employees could bring if an employer mandates a vaccine with an emergency approval from the FDA (which isnt full drug authorization and not fully tested) However because of the number of vaccinations in the US Pfizer is in process of requesting full FDA authorization By the EEOC making this action it ramps up the timeline making it possible for employers to take action now instead of 3-4 months later this summer/fall when we may see increases I infection rates TLDR - this moves up the timeline for employers to make vaccinations mandatory improving vaccination rates and protecting more people especially those who cannot get the vaccine (immuno-compromised and those under 12),tumbleweedcowboy,16223012420,1
gzw0xq0,nniy3y,Not necessarily employers but heres a fun read about this type of stuff Real Life Example: Massachusetts Mandates A Vaccine In Jacobson v Massachusetts (1905) Mr Jacobsen refused to obey a law requiring that everyone in Cambridge receive a smallpox vaccination At the time a smallpox epidemic was raging Jacobson faced a fine or imprisonment if he failed to take the vaccine Jacobsen argued that forcing him to get the vaccine violated his fundamental liberty which included freedom to control his own body The State argued that the health risk was urgent that widespread vaccination was needed to protect everyone against smallpox and that any harm to individual liberty was a price worth paying given the severe threat of smallpox The Supreme Court acknowledged that both sides had a point On one hand the Court noted that "when faced with a society-threatening epidemic a state may implement emergency measures that curtail constitutional rights so long as the measures have at least some "real or substantial relation" to the public health crisis "On the other hand the Court recognized Jacobsens argument and agreed that the vaccine order did impact liberty and personal freedom The court cautioned that "a law purporting to protect public health may nevertheless be invalid if it "has no real or substantial relation to those objects or is beyond all question a plain palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law" In short while the court balanced the two competing concernsliberty and public safetythe court came down squarely in favor of public safety holding the vaccine order was valid given the seriousness of the threat The Court said that "the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States does not import an absolute right in each person to be at all times and in all circumstances wholly freed from restraint" But the Court also warned that any if a law goes too far in restricting liberty if the law is in place for too long or reaches too far or if the goal of the law can be achieved by less invasive measures then the court may well strike down the law,LazyKidd420,16223088990,1

Cant you still transmit and contract Covid even if you are vaccinated? You might just not see any symptoms or very little But you are still infected and can infect The virus is still replicating if you are vaccinated which means evolution is still happening Maybe there is some argument to be made that unvaccinated infected people are causing more evolution and if that is the case then why not make that argument instead Saying things like this just completely ruins your credibility,indiez,16311245910,1

h9x25be,p9dd93,Its too late for me "managers" You were the one that went to a shitty open office plan that forced everyone to wear noise canceling headphones to concentrate So you did your part to make sure that most of us (me at least) have no intention of going back WFH did the rest Ive been with my current employer 18 years and Ill be talking to recruiters the day I hear we might be going back As if most managers can tell what software people (at least) are doing by actually seeing them You could run a Matrix screensaver and some would think you are being super-productive I think a lot of this is that they like to have their manager meetings with other depts and show off their fiefdoms Driving into an office in order to sit crammed in tiny stalls with headphones on remoting to servers nowhere physically close to you--that make sense to anyone? If actually walking behind people is your way to know they are productive--Id say its time to work on your business processes and get better at project management The ONLY thing Ill miss is a good whiteboard session in person I hate Zoom video its uncanny valley x4 I minimize the thing unless someone is screen sharing Thankfully 95% of our Zoom meetings are audio only,ZenZulu,16296457000,602

In an earlier proposal it was 40 why now 60? No one can explain - its all just emotion So my manager and I kept some pressure on it and now silently its gone to 50% in the newest proposal Still no explanation as to where that percentage comes from My guess is that over time the market will sort it out Organizations that request too many office hours might have difficulty attracting or retaining talent as other organizations might offer better WFH arrangments In due time therefore it is my guess that most organizations will align to a similar WFH structure,SeredW,16296479230,26

h9x060u,p9dd93,Well I started going back to the office about six weeks ago and have been there basically full time for the past three weeks due to a critical staff member being let go As soon as I get her replacement up and running I am going to go back to nearly full time WFH I will be informing my employer of this not asking And yeah Im willing to back it up with a two-week notice Theres so many reasons Delta being the first one of course and also although it may seem contradictory the imposition of an indoor mask mandate in my state (rather just stay home alone than walk around with giant piece of cloth plastered over my face) Theres the fact that our downtown area is almost entirely deserted except for the homeless addicts and mentally ill and I dont feel safe even walking to and from the bus stop And then theres this - that all of the peace Id gained working from home for 16 months all of the bad habits Id shed (among other things I hadnt had a drink in months before I started back at the office and now I"m regularly consuming at least a couple of bottles of wine a week) all of the reliably good sleep all of the feeling of being centered and present in my life - every bit of that is gone and after only a few weeks back Im so burned out I fear it would take a three month vacation just to get me back where I was at the start of summer Employers are absolutely clueless about the toll office life takes on every other aspect of our existence They should not be surprised that people dont want to go back to the way things were because they way things were was something we never should have tolerated in the first place,kat2211,16296448020,106

h9yjt68,p9dd93,I dont want to go into the office full-time but theres definitely aspects of fully working from home that I struggle with: * For whatever reason my workplace is hyper-connected Managers are now comfortable booking meetings at 6-7am or 6-7pm and have little respect for a lunch hour like they used to When you complain about it nobody cares "Just wake up earlier" they say or "just stay on for an extra two hours" they say "Its a priority so it has to get done" they say although if it really was a priority wouldnt it be worth addressing in core business hours? We used to limit meeting times to 9:30am to 3:30pm to respect everyones start and end times but now thats all out the window * People know you cant travel anywhere and are probably nearby if you have vacation time This has led to what I consider a toxic expectation that youre always around unless you explicitly tell people youre truly unavailable between these certain hours on your damn vacation Two of the managers who took vacations this summer still came online for meetings I guess maybe its admirable in the eyes of some but IMO is there nothing better to do? Read a book or go cook a meal for your kids Thats what Id be doing * I talk with my hands a lot Being confined to a tiny Zoom meeting box that filters out my arms feels stifling to me * Im not as fast on the unmute button as some people and it feels like I can never get a word in because of it Not everyone has cameras on or is paying attention to the cameras so they dont really pick up on social cues that someone is about to speak Using the "raise hand" function is nice in theory but few respect it One of my best skills in meetings was not only doing that but also respecting the quieter people and creating venues for them to speak Now its just an unmute race and Im always losing * I struggle to stay focused in Zoom meetings Its not that Im playing games or checking e-mails Even if I turn on my camera full-screen my monitor for the meeting to block out all distractions and try my best to stay focused I completely zone out hearing voices of people in various volumes and quality blasted directly into my ear via headphones * I cant stand to be in my home office after work I used to love gaming here but now I just want nothing to do with it The whole room is associated with work and I dont want to step foot in it after I log off As a programmer I used to like coming in here putting on some movies and experimenting with new tech but now it seems like a chore Its like my company now owns part of my house I still consider myself lucky that I dont have to work out of my bedroom though Is this just my company or are other people experiencing this too? I dont even know if all of these are related to working from home or not but they definitely werent problems at my company before we moved to a fully WFH environment Its strange too because we were a hybrid setup before with a mix of full remote people and people across multiple offices who wouldnt come in every day and things *seemed* fine,bluetista1988,16296690980,14

h9x38c3,p9dd93,Ive been managing a remote engineering team for about 15 years- long long before Covid After managing onsite teams for about 15 before that It is IMHO night and day more difficult to manage the remote team And IMHO most of the issues solved by remote work are actually issues with horrible open offices and long commutes- not anything specifically to do with remote vs onsite work Some thoughts from doing this for over a decade: * 25% of people will be productive no matter where they are 25% will be problematic no matter where they are 50% of people work better with some form of office infrastructure Everyone thinks they are in that first 25% * Dealing with HR issues is much much more problematic with remote employees Try dealing with terming someone with a substance abuse problem when you never get to see them in person and dont have an attendance record to support your HR case * Peoples home environments are often horribly full of distractions People put up with this during Covid because there were no other alternatives- but having someones toddler running around screaming during meetings is an issue A good WFH environment will have a dedicated home office and a good WFH employee will have uninterrupted time in that office- but most dont have their home workspaces set up properly * Peoples WFH performance deteriorates over time- especially over many years Especially with employees with kids who only one parent is WFH Suddenly you realize that you are working around an employee who has to pick up the kids from school every day during work hours- folks start building lives/schedules around being able to disappear for a couple hours a day * There are simply no good current tech substitutes for a classic conference room whiteboard session Doing this remotely sucks All of that can be managed with appropriate focus/tools/etc But it adds substantially to the managerial effort required I think it seemed to work during Covid better than it would have because many tech firms paused or slowed down their project work during that period (I know all of my clients basically shelved most of the project deliverables last/this year and we are just now getting back to regular project planning cycles) Well see maybe Ill be wrong and the tech has progressed to the point where this will work I think the norm is going to become hybrid plans where folks are in the office a couple days a week but cant fully live anywhere they want,jakdak,16296461930,43

h9zjtur,p9dd93,I have lifelong friendships and business references from working with people in an office It sounds great maybe if you are young and still in touch with school/university people for your social life Even having offices move to WFH seems great because all your coworkers are in the same area and you already have closer bonds from knowing them in-person so even over video it seems a bit more fun Well over time workers will come and go and fewer and fewer new hires will be "local" to you Though you will have social "zoom meetings" it just wont have the same impact For the past 6 years Ive worked either remotely or with a large part of the team being remote so COVID wasnt the start of this for me As Ive noticed almost nobody keeps in touch after changing jobs from these remote teams Apart from perhaps a reference for a job application there is little to zero contact No long term friendships no long term anything Sure sometimes when someone would move to a new job you might chat quite a bit talk about things but usually those fizzle to zero rather quickly However I have plenty of friends held for decades gained from working together in person We still go out to hang talk over voice and chat play online and in-person games grab some drinks or see a show Those remote people on the "Chicago Team" of a job from five years ago I struggle to remember their names now Long term this will probably damage cities and urban centers Think the rise of the automobile and massive efficient highways created suburban sprawl? Hold your beer for the new WFH economy The continent will likely become coast to coast suburbs with neighbors with tall fences who hardly know each other Its okay you can watch movies in your home You can watch sports in your home You can see concerts in your home You can have your groceries delivered Fine dining some driving service will bring you food from that local restaurant if it really exists Perhaps Taco Bell now? Welcome to your home your prison I cant wait for the downvotes here I can almost smell them Of course some of what I am saying might not completely come to be but without a doubt its a strong possibility I guarantee this first taste of 100% remote working seems great now but long term the unintended consequences have not been fully considered And by the time those consequences are more strongly realized it would probably be impossible to go back to the office or at least a long uphill battle,RedditRage,16296866320,2

ha0u59n,p9dd93,I feel the pandemic has made us all realize that in light of the technology we all use to work its extremely antiquated to have "ass in seat" workers 5 days a week Remote working in certain buisnesses is more efficient less costly and has the added benefit of being able to recruit talent from anywhere and save the company tons of money on unneeded office space It also exposes the extra fat your company can trim Its a win win win Old school buisness owners who could be on board but arent are only that way because they are old and they somehow feel like they are ripped off of they have to pay employees who get to stay in comfy clothes all day and have tv on in the background while they work Part of your perceived value is the "time you give up" not the job you do which is so backwards It should be all about the job you do whether it takes 6 hours or 12 not being miserable and trapped in a place you dont want to be,guitarguy35,16297203620,2

hceayd0,p9dd93,I am one of the people who never want to go back into the office after working about 20 years in corporate America I have embraced working from home since Covid started I love that I have down time in between meetings I can concentrate of work without disruptions grab some food and eat go sit on the deck for 15 minutes and get some sunshine and think I am a better employee and more productive I was having a conversation today with a co-worker and he thinks that things will be back to "normal" in corporate America in 3 years saying that he believes we will all be working back in the office again I said no way if a job can be done remote I believe a hybrid work environment will be embraced in a post-covid world and it will be more widely accepted to be working from home 3 years from now I am curious what others think Will corporate America have all of us working back in the office in 3 years?

h9yw6au,p9dd93,Heres my take as a member of the Executive team: a huge majority of the staff does not have to come into the office for the company to continue to run smoothly and be successful We announced that "If you want to come back let your direct manager know by X date If not no problem" Were a 500 person company 200 were already remote Of the 300 remaining 70-ish wanted to come back We save money in the long run and have happier staff (as of now) On the flip side there is absolutely less off-the-cuff collaboration That stifles creativity and perhaps innovation but not to the point that its worth mandating Another angle is that remote worker put in much more time since there is no finality to the end I prefer a balance personally I go in Monday - Wednesday EDIT: If youre in Sales and your manager/company is forcing you back in then its time to quit They dont trust you and want to babysit activity,makgeolliandsoju,16296749170,1

ha04grb,p9dd93,This is something I suggested to my company in the UK: Hi folks Ive given some consideration to this and would like to suggest the below rules to satisfy a flexible work offering to the SD: I have based this on: 23 SD staff (8x 24/7 engineers 15x Core shift) Image Image Image Each engineer must come in 40% of their time Each day there must be at least 5 people physically on rotad shift Each day there must be no more than 10 engineer on schedule We split the WFH days in any given week between a choice of Monday+Tuesday or Thursday+Friday This grants opportunity of "extended weekend feeling" to all Q: Why 40% submission to physical occupation? A: TeamLead stated Service Desk requires an obligatory 15% physical office presence on any working day Q: How does this impact skill availability? A: It doesnt this is based purely on resource as we have availability across core teams in the working week On average we will have 8 engineers physically within the office space Q: How this is managed? A: Either by a scheduling app/portal where engineers self-sign up (first come first serve) and commit to fulfilling their weekly hours or assigned by TLs Q: How does this solution address 24/7 flexibility? A: Whilst 24/7 day shift must attend the office space 24/7 night shift fulfil duties from home Any 24/7 day shift falling on a weekend is fulfilled from home This is open to your adjustments or leave as is in the pot for discussion and practical application for the business Thanks" Glad to say this has now been adopted  Before COVID happened my company was on target to turn 200m so they purchased a new HQ for 15m We are an IT Managed Service Provider The company had plans to go global looking for offices in the USA They signed the contract grace period passed and then COVID happened They were unable to back out of the deal and have since been working within regulations of UK lockdowns and government guidance to continue with the new head office plan We have lost only 1 employee during this pandemic and that was after he contracted Covid after major surgery Work load has increased the employment demand at our company due to demand from clients working remotely and other IT projects Due to Covid theyve put the expansion on the back burner for now and are cautiously monitoring markets and of course Covid itself They still want to expand to the US Fingers crossed!  As we have hospitals and government clients for technical support we were actually classed as support workers and got full 80% furlough offered but we didnt need to take it Covid has just sped up the work from home culture and those that do not change their ways are set to lose good employees Mental health has been cited as one of the major drivers with a large majority of workers being effected I personally have been wfh social distancing and wearing a mask in public since 2019 when my wife started chemotherapy after a mastectomy So this has been the norm for us long before Covid came along I do think there is a need for a physical space a lot of clients say the office is a place to separate home and work life Ive never had this as an issue in fact I am blessed that I have seen my son grow up since his birth in 2019 I get to spend time playing with him look after my wife and be home "on time" or work late if I want to An hour here and there longer doesnt kill me in fact I believe I start earlier and finish on time or happy to work later I think sales people need that physical connection and banter with their colleagues its the nature of that beast I know from a lot of clients and other companies I interviewed for that WFH was a massive positive to performance and output but over time people have got complacent or lazy and now efficiency is actually on the back slide WFH is definitely here to stay to what degree and capacity offered is another thing Ps feel free to use my wfh flexible working plan ,PrimarisBA,16296996010,1

h3yaqxw,ocwhp4,Im glad this is here because I didnt want to post and I cant So here is the thing before the pandemic I had asthma an issue I had struggled with all my life and more I constantly got sick starting usually with colds then respiratory infections walking neumona chronic sinus infections all of this before ultimately getting better and slowly starting the same cycle all over again from year to year with varying degrees of severity fluctuating throughout my life After 2020 specifically January or maybe December year previous I had come back home to Oregon because I was chronically ill and unable to eat food I had gone from 220lb to just 147 in two months That issue is still on going I only mention it to make known that I had previously been in a failed physical state as well prior to the outbreak When the outbreak occurred it did so in Hillsboro Oregon the city we lived in at the time and we had already been sick all of us with respiratory issues Something were all well familiar with and more and equipped to deal with it since it runs in the family It passed like nothing for my family but I as per usual began my long cycle starting with the initial cold step; however when it came to the respiratory infection step everything changed In the past my mucus at this point would be thick heavy and brown and it would make it extremely difficult and painful for me to remove it by force namely deliberately coughing it all up over and over again until all of it for that day was gone and then sleep rinse repeat until fully recovered people I am poor as SHIT! When its your whole Life! You find a way Anyways I got to that step but this time my mucus had changed It was now white like histamine light stringy and sticky This made it near impossible to cough out The only reason my method had worked in the past was because it was near solid when brown and I could use the muscles around my lungs to forcefully eject the solid mass once it had built to a certain level Now as right now it just stays as a light presence in my lungs but at that time I tried wildly to eject it to the point that I may have either dislocated my collar bone documented as having been dislocated as a child or my shoulder I dont know for sure I tried and failed but its ok I was for reasons I wont get into examined against my will at a hospital some time after these events and they cleared me as never having had the corona virus subsequently released from unmentioned hospital Since that time my mucus has not gone back to the way it was and Ive not gotten any colds sinus infections none of it I started gaining my weight back more my muscle is rebuilding with very little effort and I have not changed my diet I eat virtually nothing and I mean that I am daily on a starvation diet My wife currently is trying to follow me she is at 114lb meanwhile eating less than she does I currently am just under 180lb I ate steak two days ago I virtually only eat meat these days Here is what I know Prior to the outbreak I was withering and I had been fighting respiratory issues my whole life despite making more than the usual effort to maintain my health through rigorous diet and exercise which had wained in the last three years leading up due to family a child full time work and marital stress Currently I am demonstrably better No changes to my diet since 2019 which consist of regular daily fasting only drinking milk sometimes mixed with peanut butter and a banana once or twice daily and occasionally red meat and sea life No changes to my family whom I still continue to struggle with daily weighting heavily on my psyche Ive been out of work since 2019 so that has not changed but things overall in my family and my living situation has improved Nevertheless the bigger factory being diet has not changed but my mucus has Im writing this while caring for my eight month old son one of two so spare me some consideration here if youre still reading lol in conclusion I got better after the pandemic and although I was told I had not been infected I believe that I was and I also believe that Ive overall as a life form become stronger as a result Im changing physically and physiologically for my betterment and that makes me genuinely wonder if vaccinating myself against these possible natural dangers is not the wrong way to go? Are we not looking for that key to open the door to the next phase of biological evolution? Or are we just waiting for Elon and machines to make things easy for us?

h97a4xw,p5gzct,What sorts of ramifications or accommodations exist for those who cannot receive the vaccine eg people with specific medical conditions or children? Like if mom and dad wanted to take the kid out for a birthday dinner is that just a no-go now unless the kid is over twelve? For adults who cannot receive the shot I know that most of them were already using their friends and family to handle things like proxy shopping and such but kids dont really have as many options when its illegal to leave them in the car while mom who is vaccinated is in the store I could see some severe impacts for single parents who literally dont have any place to put their kids and must keep them present at all times if the ruling truly applies to literally **everyone** who hasnt been vaccinated kids toddlers and infants included Could indeed make for some quiet restaurants though so for anybody looking for a romantic evening without a six-year-old running between tables to show off his dinosaurs: get on it while the getting is good!,Meatslinger,16291453230,1
h97luoc,p5gzct,So Im prepared to get downvoted but just to preface this statement keep in mind im vaccinated and i have been playing ball and completely get the need for caution But with the vaccine we are supposed to be safe from covid yeah? Like We can still get it but similar to say a flu shot it isnt as likely and nowhere near as dangerous Now im being told that the delta variant makes the vaccine virtually useless so we are back to square one Im getting real tired trying to explain to the anti mask folks i live around that the vaccine is the way to go when i turn around and see that it might not work at all i have been kept away from going out and enjoying myself for almost 2 years now missed out on having a 21st birthday party and am getting real frustrated with everything Sorry for the rant but i have been playing ball this whole time and now im being told just as everything gets back to normal that we are back to square one and to return to existing by myself and continue avoiding other humans This isnt living am i crazy to rather risk my life and continue living life than stay in hiding? I know this stuff is serious and im not trying to be some psycho anti-mask anti-vax weirdo im just really frustrated that i have lost so much of my life and now im being told it was all for naught,ndelte7,16291499730,1

Hospitals are full no ICU beds Here in upstate NY we sometimes wait 3 to 4 HOURS outside the hospital with the patient in the ambulance because there are no beds in the ER And while we are waiting we cannot respond to other calls that come in People will die in this scenario from injuries or medical issues that were treatable And that makes me angry Not sure who to blame Government anti-vaxxers anti-maskers businesses that dont enforce rules the list seems endless But watching a patient die in the back of an ambulance 100 feet from the ER doors because there is no capacity to provide care is something I dont wish on anyone,IronScaggs,16413923930,8260

"Oh no thats for asymptomatic only you have to go to the regular places" All appointments full Get an at-home test? Sold out everywhere Order one online?

I shouldnt be this stunned but yet I cant believe how mismanaged all of this was even with a seemingly "competent" Government back in command Did they all collectively get-together and just say "fuck it business as usual" and forgot to announce that? **EDIT**: Just an FYI I live in Central New York around the Syracuse area and things are generally managed well (we get a LOT of snow and its usually plowed within a reasonable amount of time so they know how to handle these types of issues) The fact that its this bad here makes me feel bad for the States/Counties that REALLY didnt lift a finger and try to help Our local Government officials are doing what they can but its nowhere near enough to stem the tide of Omicron Nobody was prepared and nobody TRIED to get prepared Complete failures all-around,VheloGrace,16413960850,560

hrdbk3d,rwn229,Im not sure what to make of these numbers Deaths are less than half the last wave Check the data for yourself HALF https://wwwnytimescom/interactive/2021/us/massachusetts-covid-caseshtml Now Im sure ICUs are preventing more deaths than they did last year but cases are double their peak yet half the deaths? Vaccines are working So honestly the death data leads me to believe there are waaaaay less people in the ICU vs last year Not sure Im buying these drama headlines or why the hospitals are struggling this year vs last And Mass general on their own website stated they have ICU capacity as of 12/24 https://datargjcom/covid-19-hospital-capacity/facility/massachusetts-general-hospital/220071/ Now Im sure the holiday surge probably pushed those numbers up but look at last year the same time frame They had 157 ICU beds last Christmas They now have 147 Theyve lost 9% of their beds (probably due to staff having Covid) But that isnt exactly a crisis and they still appear to have capacity But just saying do the research for yourself and come to your own conclusions Then again its Reddit and no one gives a $&@% A sensationalistic headline gets way more clicks even if the article is offering alternative facts and people have an attention span of an ant So who cares right? Im gonna save this mass general link so I can check the data for next week Not reaching a conclusion yet but based on this data Im leaning towards "yes this is a problem but its not the end of the world crisis the internet makes you believe" EDIT: and honestly the EMT post below was asking who to blame? Look at the Mass General link and how much capacity they had last Nov they over shot offering 210+ beds Operating at half capacity is not profitable for the hospital so it makes sense they would scale down and run at capacity If youre looking for someone to blame clearly this is hospital managements problem Theyve underestimated the demand for ICU beds and werent able to scale up fast enough Granted this is an extremely difficult thing to predict Who knew right?

there is no vaccine authorized for children under 16 Also contributing to the surge of virus among young people is the spread of variants that are both more contagious and more lethal; the tendency of many younger adults to disregard COVID-19 guidelines and the fact that schools have reopened "Its definitely become more of a young person disease now probably because they havent been vaccinated and theyve been more likely than older folks to go out and about be in close contact with others and go to gatherings" said Dr Mark Hamed a physician who is medical director for Huron Lapeer Sanilac Tuscola Alcona Iosco Ogemaw and Oscoda counties The numbers bear that out In the first year of the pandemic Michigan residents age 60 and older accounted for 23% of cases; its now 13% Conversely those under age 20 accounted for 13% of cases during the first 12 months of the pandemic; its now 25% The chart below shows the April case numbers by age group compared to the monthly average through March 2021 as well as compared to December 2020 during the fall surge [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/WNTiwqVd1gGfPM09p2D0qzVgFZY=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/VQGMMSPTZNGADOVJQPKGAWILMQPNG) In theory thats actually a welcomed shift from the standpoint that old age is easily the biggest risk factor for being hospitalized or dying of COVID-19 But experts have been taken aback by the spike in COVID-19 hospitalizations among younger adults and children Compared to the height of the fall surge in early December Michigans average daily hospitalization admissions for COVID-19 are up 33% for those age 18 to 29 58% for thirty-somethings and 64% for those in their 40s Meanwhile hospitalizations for those age 80 and older are down 60% compared to December [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/86v1e7Apdm4-zWbHd-9Q7X4rAh0=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/RPEUG3IW5JGXTF6HQYL2RBK67Upng) "Its like you take what we were seeing before and shift it down by one or two decades" said Dr Joel Fishbain an infectious disease specialist for Beaumont Hospital in Grosse Pointe "Weve got 20-year-olds who are getting admitted and 30-year-olds requiring oxygen which we never saw before and needing as much treatment as we can give them Weve got 40- and 50-year-olds ending up on ventilators" Pediatric cases also are up Last week the state was averaging almost 10 hospital admissions a day among pediatric patients with COVID-19 triple the number in mid-February Deaths among children and younger adults have spiked too In the first 13 months of the pandemic there were six deaths among children ages 10 to 19 In the past month four deaths were reported Another 65 deaths were reported in April for 20- and 30-somethings quadruple the monthly average The chart below compares April deaths to the monthly average through March 2021 as well as to confirmed COVID deaths in December The numbers show how deaths among seniors plummeted in April compared to December as a result of vaccinations while coronavirus variants spiked deaths among unvaccinated people under age 50 [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/caQyJGE9C2BiswUM2ThU22RJumk=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/ZXCIGC7VWZCN7H65ULFSFE4GPIPNG) Deaths and hospitalizations arent the only concern While most COVID patients under age 50 "dont get severely ill there are a growing number of people who have long-haul COVID symptoms" said Dr Liam Sullivan an infectious disease specialists with Spectrum Health in Grand Rapids "They have problems with smelling with taste with concentration with memory with fatigue with night sweats "So even though they had a mild illness the first time around theyre still dealing with these things month and months later and thats not something you want to deal with when youre 25 or 35" he said "Of course you dont want to deal with it at any age but especially when youre in the prime of your life" And for women the research is growing on the dangers of COVID-19 during pregnancy Dr Kurt Wharton an Oakland County obstetrician currently has four pregnant patients in intensive care units battling COVID-19 All four are "fighting for their lives" said Wharton who works at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak While COVID-19-related deaths among pregnant women remain very rare Wharton and others say the evidence is growing that coronavirus during pregnancy can put a woman at a much higher risk of preterm birth preeclampsia and admission to the ICU and/or intubation especially if the woman has pre-existing conditions such as high blood pressure obesity diabetes or heart disease Evidence growing on COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy: Virus is dangerous; the shots are not Doctors offer several theories on why more younger people are getting significantly ill with COVID-19 in the current surge One is the spread of variants which are both more contagious and more lethal The variants are "stickier" Hamed said which means it takes less exposure to make someone severely ill or even symptomatic Wharton noted the same pattern happened during the 1918 influenza pandemic The initial surge in the spring of 1918 primarily impacted the elderly and babies But the virus mutated and came roaring back in the fall of 1918 and its primary victims during that surge were younger adults "History is repeating itself" Wharton said Another issue suggests Hamed and others: More unvaccinated people are gathering in groups without masks That increases the risk of exposure to a higher viral load which has been associated with more severe disease "The best mask you wear the less viral load you inhale" Wharton said On top that many schools have reopened and children and younger adults in particular are resuming their pre-pandemic social lives "You can see it" Wharton said "Younger people are all out in groups again walking down sidewalks shopping going to restaurants and bars together They just think theyre invulnerable" The good news is that COVID-19 vaccinations have proven "wildly successful" in significantly reducing the chances of getting the virus and spreading to others Sullivan said And just as vaccinations have blunted spread of the virus among senior citizens the spread of COVID among younger adults can be stymied through immunization shots Vaccination programs "really need to target the younger people right now" Sensor said "Theyre the ones who are getting sick Weve done a really good job of vaccinating our older population but to really move forward and get out of this pandemic we really need our younger people to step up to the plate and get the vaccine to protect themselves and protect their families",itsdr00,16198732450,154

h9pnz04,p8e6s6,"The Food and Drug Administration is pushing to approve Pfizer-BioNTechs two-dose Covid-19 vaccine on Monday further expediting an earlier timeline for licensing the shot according to people familiar with the agencys planning Regulators were working to finish the process by Friday but were still working through a substantial amount of paperwork and negotiation with the company The people familiar with the planning who were not authorized to speak publicly about it cautioned that the approval might slide beyond Monday if some components of the review need more time An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment The agency had recently set an unofficial deadline for approval of around Labor Day The approval is expected to pave the way for a series of vaccination requirements by public and private organizations who were awaiting firmer regulatory backing before implementing mandates Federal and state health officials are also hoping that an approved vaccine will draw interest from some Americans who have been hesitant to take one that was only authorized for emergency use a phenomenon suggested by recent polling Some universities and hospitals are expected to mandate inoculation once a vaccine is fully approved The Pentagon earlier this month said it plans to make Covid vaccinations mandatory for the countrys 13 million active-duty troops "no later" than the middle of next month or sooner if the FDA acts earlier The timing of the approval could result in an uncomfortable messaging problem for the Biden administration which on Wednesday announced that fully vaccinated people should prepare to get booster shots eight months after they received second doses Approving the vaccine and encouraging boosters at the same time may suggest to some that the vaccine as licensed is inadequate without an extra shot The FDA last week updated its authorizations of Pfizer-BioNTechs and Modernas vaccine to allow third doses for some immunocompromised people a decision backed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Regulators are still reviewing Modernas application for full approval for its coronavirus vaccine and a decision could come at least several weeks after the one for Pfizer-BioNTech",urbanpencil,16294944330,203

gwysdn4,n4uoij,Probably going to be downvoted for saying this but here are my reasons for being in the "unlikely" camp I want to get it the vaccine so Im curious if anyone can actually refute some of these points: Restrictions have become a moral question with easing restrictions being seen as evil and more restrictions good Seeing peoples reactions to people in this thread saying they want restrictions eased is proof of that Theres no point to getting vaccinated if well have to wear masks attend online school and have businesses shut down/otherwise crippled indefinitely The side effects and no Im not talking about the fringe cases of people dying etc I trust it enough that Im not worried about them Theres just no time in my world to feel like I got hit by an electric streetcar for upwards of a week Im a college student and accommodations made to people down for the count from the immediate side effects highly depend on the professor There will be no accommodations for me Reduced availability from the J&J freeze I had originally intended to take the J&J vaccine to minimize the effect of the previous point but after the freeze it became and continues to be incredibly difficult in my area to get Cost This is a simple one but there are likely to be negative financial repercussions for getting it ie having to pay for it Lack of a positive incentive As a college student I didnt receive any stimulus checks that went out earlier this and last year There might be a reason to get it if there was an incentive to doing so in a similar manner I would actually receive but I see no movement on that The effectiveness time per vaccine Ive heard estimates putting the time of effectiveness as low as 3-6 months depending on the variant Given all these other factors the fact that I would have to take this 4x a year in perpetuity makes this sound about as futile as it gets Those are the big ones and I dont really see any of them changing any time soon at least in my area Open to new information/having my mind changed I really do see the positives in getting it but until these roadblocks are gone it remains unlikely I will,BTSInDarkness,16201726700,4

hdlacvc,prsbj3,The headlines are skewing this VERY positively This is actually not very reassuring data in terms of likelihood getting the vaccine approved There wasnt enough COVID observed particularly severe illness/hospitalization to determine clinical efficacy which is why they had to use antibody response as a surrogate endpoint Antibody levels are not a very good measure of real world clinical efficacy and its unclear what they mean and how much benefit they actually confer particularly in children The FDA may have a hard time issuing the EUA in the coming weeks with the data we have now and I wouldnt at all be surprised if they ask for more After all EUA stands for **Emergency** Use Authorization and the virus hardly qualifies as an emergency in children based on this data Id love to argue that its an emergency in adults and vaccinating kids would help but in general we have a real tough time approving interventions in kids without evidence of much direct benefit to them particularly under EUA I know Im gonna get downvoted for this but Im a resident pediatrician and I truly wanted this to work more than anyone Disappointed with how the data shook out At the same time I wouldnt want anything to be approved without CLEAR evidence that the benefit outweighs the risk and its hard to say we have enough data to determine that at this time,chocoholicsoxfan,16321461530,50

gufn854,mpzwzj,US still seeing over 20-30 times the daily deaths and cases compared to the UK is a bit weird (all schools reopened in UK for three weeks before Easter) UK did start with Pfizer for the eldest patients in early December but then early January had a huge rollout of AZ vaccine with a change of strategy to 1-shot prioritisation (so delaying second shot to 12 weeks) And so far it seems to have worked amazingly well There are the 1 in a million fatal blood clot reports in UK from AZ too but the early hysteria about anaphylactic reactions to the Pfizer doses has disappeared for some reason (its much more common than blood clots) (They let you leave the vaccination room straight away after AZ jab with Pfizer you have to wait at 15-30 mins before you are allowed to leave because of this issue),escherbach,16183605030,3

gufb9d0,mpzwzj,Although I understand the concern its very possible this is a statistically normal phenomenon Heres some math to consider: The incidence of clots in women on oral contraceptives is 03%-1% over 10 years There are about 65 million women age 18-50 in the US About 14% are on the pill That means at the high end of the range you could expect 24 women per day could get a clot (ie 9000000\*001/3650 = 24) If we assume the distribution of the JnJ vaccine wasnt demographically biased (which may not be the case but the data on it should be available) then 7000000\*65000000/330000000\*014 = 193000 were women age 18-48 on oral contraceptives This is about 214% of all women in that demographic So over the course of a month you would expect those women to be responsible for 00214\*24\*30 = 154 clots at the high end of the normal risk range and 46 at the low end of the range The actual reported number was 6 Even assuming 50% reporting this is well within the normal range And that doesnt even account for pregnant women who also have an increased risk of clots Running the numbers for 54 million pregnant women (at any given time) each with a 01% chance of developing a clot Therefore on any given day you could expect 5400000\*0001/280 = 193 pregnant women to experience a clot or 580 in the course of a month Now granted pregnant women may have been less likely to get the vaccine (although its reportedly safe during pregnancy) BUT lets ignore that potential bias for a minute and assume that 5400000/330000000\*7000000 = 115000 pregnant women got the vaccine in the last month Those women would be responsible for 115000/5400000\*580 = 124 additional clots over the course of that month So under totally regular circumstances it wouldnt be abnormal for 27 out of the 3500000 women in question to get a clot in a given month This leaves a lot of room for the potential effect of biases in these stats Its obviously critical to verify all this though so I understand why the CDC would want to shut things down while they delve into the data Hindsight is 20/20 but I would say its really not surprising this was the main adverse event that was reported Women age 18-48 have a very very low rate of sudden unexpected mortality due to an adverse clinical event Even though the survival rate for a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is 95% that 5% is a significant number for individuals who are otherwise totally healthy Id be willing to bet its one of the top sudden physiological causes of mortality in the demographic in question Glancing at the data for the AstraZeneca vaccine it seems very similar Im curious -- have no patients who got the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines experienced clots?

gue5f9l,mpzwzj,https://healthscimcmasterca/news-events/news/news-article/2021/03/22/mcmaster-scientist-resolves-covid-19-clot-question If the clotting is caused by the immune response (antibodies and platelets) wont it stand to reason that the patient could be given blood thinners on a temporary basis? I think the antibodies go away after a period of time (how long?) and then its the remaining T-Cells that help with an immune response during the next exposure? So presumably there would be no need to be on blood thinners permanently? Although what confuses me is this: Once we go back to normal and people have been vaccinated isnt the whole point that their body will ramp up and make a ton of antibodies real quick in response to exposure to the actual virus? Does this mean there is a risk of blood clotting due to viral exposure for those who have been vaccinated regardless of the vaccine? I need someone who understands immunology better than me to explain all this Does it seem like those who are having the severe reaction to the vaccine are the same folks who would have had a crazy immune system overreaction to the virus? What is it about some peoples immune systems?

Absolutely not! Weve been saying things like "Wear masks they arent perfect but every little bit helps" "Skip christmas every little bit helps" "get vaccinated every little bit helps"and then we turn around say "You know what nevermind everyone come on back to work even though we KNOW some of you will STILL be contagious" Funny how only individuals are asked to sacrifice to make every little bit help,Krytan,16416687040,9

hrollh0,ryb5hr,Talking to my sister last night (shes a doctor and was running the triage during her shift that day) she told me: \- Omicron is re-infecting people who already had it Shes admitted multiple (unvaccinated) people in her ICU who had been released from the ICU a few weeks earlier with a clean bill of health The prognosis for re-infected ICU patients is grim \- About 1/3 of her staff is out sick Omicron is ripping through the staff so as some come back others fall ill \- Even though the hospital is woefully understaffed theyre still well over capacity for a fully staffed hospital \- Past reports of "super immunity" for people who had covid and got their vaccinations seem to not apply to omicron \- Her ER is full of patients who should be in hospital beds Many normal medical procedures cant be performed because the patients also have covid so things like psych evals have to be done in the ICU in a negative pressure room rather than in the psych ward which means the ICU needs an empty room before they can happen etc \- The ICU shift is becoming the most sought after shift because so many people are on ventilators that the doctors dont do much and can actually get a rest Think about that What should be one of the most intense shifts is now easy because the people who need that level of attention cant even get a bed due to all of the comatose covid patients \- Finally she re-iterated that unvaccinated people are about 20 times more likely than vaccinated people to end up in the hospital She didnt think any of her current ICU patients were vaccinated Her advice was to not have any heart attacks and dont get into any car accidents for the next few months and she thinks its going to get a lot worse before it gets better She expects that once things get really bad about half the staff will just quit because they cant take it making the problem much much worse This is in California which is in the better half of the country in terms of vaccination and viral spread,Kahzgul,16415864650,277

hrs4mut,ryb5hr,I passed a kidney stone a few days ago this is my fourth one and the second one in the last year It was very small I have some naproxen here for other issues I took my naproxen for the pain and did not go to the hospital I called my doctor and made an appointment for next week to get a scan to make sure that theres no more stones and a test for a UTI The wait time to get seen in the hospital is 10 to 20 hours here even though I live near a big city and there are dozens of hospitals that I could choose from What would be the point of me going to sit in an ER to wait for pain medication for 20 hours and get scanned? This is normally something that you would go to the ER for and get intravenous pain medicine even if its just toradol and let them go ahead and do a scan on you to see if you have any more kidney stones But right now its not life-threatening so you dont go to the ER And I could have went to the urgent Care the next day but theyre also backed up and you could be in there all day And if Im waiting 24 hours anyway for care why not just go to my primary in a few days? Thats also the reality of this not only are people dying because of this but youre not going to be able to get the regular care for situations that are extremely painful And if this was not like my fourth kidney stone and if I didnt have other chronic health issues where I had decent at home pain medication (even if not opiates which I dont take) I wouldnt know what was going on and I would have been in a lot of pain So Im very angry about the situation and folks are going to have to get their crap together,morbidbutwhoisnt,16416528020,4

hrrujw9,ryb5hr,From the article: "Medicine runs on an unspoken social contract in which medical professionals expect themselves to sacrifice their own well-being for their patients" This has always been my problem with the "healthcare is a human right" arguments If health care requires the sacrifice of someone else in order to be provided how can it be a human right? I feel like this is becoming more and more apparent as healthcare workers quit How are they obligated to provide health care to ungrateful and non-compliant individuals risking their own health? In my experience healthcare is a risky and oftentimes brutal struggle against death It can be painful humiliating and traumatizing Which is why sometimes patients refuse treatment Describing it as a human right is just ridiculous When there is no one left to provide this "right" then what happens?

Theres only two ways to stop this virus Isolate everyone in the whole world for one month no matter if they have symtoms or not Or just ignore it and dont treat those that have fallen very ill so that "mother nature filter the heard" (Again not proposing we should do above!),joshiegy,16413000810,2

ha7111a,pamuzn,after pumping the message of "get vaxed resume life" nonstop putting a new message like this out there which will be interpreted as: "on an individual level theres an undefined amount of additional work to be done afterwards and then maybe well see" is counterproductive imo we cant get double the vaccines in our arms to make up for the stubborn idiots we cant put twice the amount of masks on to make up for the people that dont wear them and we cant lockdown twice as hard for the idiots that partied on spring break throughout the previous peaks reward good reward and punish bad the work that still needs to be done is with local leaders hospitals setting policy companies setting policy for staff etc pivoting from "get vaccinated resume life" to "get vaccinated require vaccines for those ready to resume life resume life" seems like an easier more actionable pivot to accomplish something (besides just inspiring defeatism) than "get vaccinated hope that the dumbest lowlifes catch on eventually and maybe next year you get to live again but stay tuned" on a community level if we could require vaccines/proof of negative tests to participate in "normal" life sooner i think hammering that message would do more to incentivize individuals than when only looking at things nationally/globally good luck getting the crowd that has already done everything more or less right during quarantines mandates etc to continue paying attention while they watched a bunch of hicks bury their heads in the sand cancel out any progress and continue to stay tuned in after already sacrificing a year of life i know its complicated but seems so counterproductive not to spend time also highlighting the spots in the country that succeeded and have been able to have more normalcy already and to balance the national/international gloom and doom with the stark contrast from the cities and communities that have done it right look at floridas deaths currently surpassing the deaths of their previous peaks LONG AFTER A VACCINE HAS BEEN WIDELY AVAILABLE TO THEIR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS (eg 999% of the people that die from covid) then look at the cities that have reached 60-70%+ fully vaxed having music festivals outdoors with no burden on hospital capacity and (except for those highly at risk to begin with those in nursing homes or in healthcare or education) apart from slapping a mask on in an uber and grocery store already are back to normal it was (supposed to be) a team effort until there was a vaccine available for the most at risk which many never participated in or actively sabotaged while others did their part but now that there is a vaccine for the majority of the population and the majority of older folks have gotten it it isnt going to be a one-size-fits-all approach for each individual: qualifying for a vaccine vax rates in the individuals community co-morbidity occupation contact (or lack of contact) with at-risk or groups that cant yet get vaccinated all realistically play more of a role on how much "normal" you get to have the broader context is necessary but its an increasingly hard sell in healthy vaccinated populations to continue to buckle down seemingly endlessly when life itself is insanely short my community has done what it takes and it makes no sense to send a message to the group that has followed marching orders to now wait for the lowlifes in florida to catch up and then maybe u get your normal well be getting boosters before they get a faction of these morons vaccinated fuck em i think about all my friends that own businesses in chicago that barely stayed afloat before there was a vaccine reading this seeing this new "maybe" date (when it could instead be as simple as letting businesses set a policy to reward folks for getting vaccinated) because of some downstate/out of state hillbillies and it makes me sick,lisaleftsharklopez,16298309000,4

The Corona Cabinet approved: Insulation for returnees from abroad African variant Omicron (Photo: Reuters) South Africa has transferred new information to Israel - and this is the data | Photo: Reuters The contradictory messages of vaccine manufacturers The test of the effectiveness of existing vaccines against the new variant was in its infancy but Modern CEO Stefan Bensel managed to arouse global concern today when he said in an interview with the Financial Times that he expects a significant decrease in vaccine efficacy But Bensel spoke of a decline in benefit from a disease with symptoms rather than a serious illness - a difference that is known to be dramatic in corona contexts as Pfizer CEO Albert Burla was apt to describe: Defense compared to Delta but that would be the limit In both cases the booster vaccines are expected to reduce the gap dramatically " Burla who promised to know more about the benefits of the vaccine against the variant in about a week and a half said Pfizer had already begun developing a specific vaccine against the variant a few days ago "We know the genetic linkage of the virus we have it - thats how it starts" he explained "We started at risk to produce a vaccine We actually started on Friday to produce a vaccine based on the flooring the DNA template that would allow us to make RNA that would eventually women within that vaccine" Israel meanwhile is waiting for a more categorical statement from the two CEOs and meanwhile relies on data coming from South Africa - where the variant was first discovered - and from which it appears that the omicron is more contagious but is no more violent "Data on the benefits of the vaccine - there may be some partial data from South Africa" Dr Sharon Elrai-Price head of public health services said today during a debate in the Knesset I know they are doing the lab tests as I described to see how useful the vaccine against this variant is " Bennett worried: "There is a lot of uncertainty" Albert Burla and Naftali Bennett (Adapted by Reuters) Burla optimistic Bennett explains why he activated the GSS | Arrangement: Reuters At the same time the government is today approving a memorandum of law that will allow it to extend the decision to allow the GSS to verify the cellular devices of those infected with Omicron or the suspects who were infected with it with high probability - in order to interrupt the transmission chains as quickly as possible But just before the move reaches the Knesset the coalition itself is sharply critical of the law Prime Minister Bennett - who saw for himself how in the ministers WhatsApp groups Ministers Saar Shasha-Bitton Barbibai and Avidar voted against - told today why Israel decided to include the GSS in the campaign despite and perhaps because it is a low number of infected "There is a lot of uncertainty and that is why we are taking these extreme measures" he said in a video call with Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schlenberg "But our advantage as leaders is that once we know more when there is more information - we can let go of those measures gradually" As for the restrictions at Ben Gurion Airport the prime minister has already decided that these will last about two weeks from the date of the decision - and only if the final proof does come that the variant does not endanger the populations immunity or the omicron is already spread in the community - these restrictions will be removed Yaron Avraham participated in the preparation of the article,Serenity101,16383425550,2

hmq9bde,r5ueps,Its important to note that Israel counts those eligible for a booster but who havent gotten a booster shot as among the unvaccinated I would speculate that this means that those who have received no vaccine are more than twice as must at risk for serious illness From the Google translated page: "another worrying statistic was discovered regarding the unvaccinated: their risk of becoming seriously ill is 24 times the original strain of the coronavirus the one that arrived in israel nearly two years ago in "unvaccinated" it also refers to those vaccinated in two doses who are entitled to boosters and have not yet been vaccinated and therefore their protection is insufficient",jpoteet2,16383161890,1

hmsrd5d,r5ueps,What is interesting is that there are so many mutations on the spike protein the part the vaccine targets But the protection compares to delta is similar?

hnflckn,r9otza,Ive been teaching in China for 18 years and this is par for the course Ill first say Ive always worked in the private sector and there have been times that Ive been outsourced to public schools on occasion while working with a few schools in the past What a gong show Not criticizing China Just humanity in general So I came **right** after the WHO lifted the SARS travel ban to China Id planned on moving to China earlier and SARS ended up delaying my departure by a few months There are always sick kids coming to school It really broke my heart Id see kids as young as 4 years old coming to class run down and sick It just made me think "if youre going to run your kid into the ground like this at this age what kind of physical condition can you expect them to be in when theyre 30?" When H1N1 was a thing I was working 3 afternoons a week at a high school and DAMN I had classes where students were constantly going to the bathroom to puke their guts out 1/4-1/3 of the students were clearly effected I constantly encouraged them to go home but they didnt see it as an option because their teachers and parents didnt accept the practice of saying home to get better and not risk spreading their illness to others A few years later I had a kid come to school looking kinda sick and before class I asked the girls mother and she upright admitted that she was aware that her child was infected with FMD which can be extremely fatal to humans who are younger/have less developed immune systems I couldnt believe this woman I informed my co-workers of the situation We immediately locked all of the classrooms because we didnt want anyone in the other classrooms to get infected It literally took over an hour to convince the mother to take her child out of the school It was literally impossible to convince her that shed done something wrong by taking her child outside let alone to a school filled with other younglings She attempted to fight the manager when we told her that she wouldnt be able to bring her child back into the school without proof from a local hospital that her daughter was no longer contagious After the insane woman left we spent a few hours sanitizing everything in the school It must have been a weird experience for the kids and teachers in the other classrooms They normally would have finished class a long time ago and would have been let out of the classroom for breaks but they had to just hang out in the classroom while we insured that wed done our best to make sure it was safe for the kids to come out TBH we shouldnt have had anything to do with this process There should have been some division of the government to contact to have them ensure that this is done properly especially given how this disease is famous for coming through areas and taking the lives of children in waves but yeah we didnt have such a luxury at our disposal COVID wasnt nearly as bad The government had clearly learned from SARS and figured out a way to deal with it in their own way After the COVID lockdown had ended it was really nice to see so many kids come to class wearing masks I even had co-workers wearing masks when they had a cold which is something I couldnt have imagined happening ever before COVID COVID really made me question why the hell we havent been wearing masks when under the weather all of these years I think it should be a given You shouldnt be free to spread your germs when youre feeling ill just regardless of whether or not you live in a free country,ThaddCorbett,16387743750,13

h63kvd6,op1283,Im too tired to read through every comment (I tried but this is rightly active!) so apologies if this has been asked or addressed already I see the New York Times today saying 49% of the US population is fully vaccinated now Now Delta is tearing through and for those who survive they will have developed varying degrees of native immunity Also those whove already recovered from having had Covid and arent vaccinated also add to what Ive read is called "hybrid immunity" (a mix between vaccinated immunity and acquired immunity via contracting the disease) Do we know at what point we consider the entire population of both vaxxed and Covid survivors combined sufficient enough to make the community feel "safe" (a relative term and measured against each persons own health) It seems like the message has been along the lines of (correct me if Ill wrong) "If 80% of the population is vaxxed we can consider this under control" or something to that extent Is it impossible to have it under control (as in new variants may arise but arent easily spreadable and if they are arent very potent/deadly) with this "hybrid immunity"or has that idea been proven wrong?

gyhii59,nefjup,I think it is time The mask mandates cant last forever but they needed to last at the very least until we had a vaccine available Sometime between vaccine availability and 100% vaccination rate is when the mandates go away of course Were nearing the 50% vaccination line and thats probably not a bad target Will the unvaccinated lie and not wear masks? Of course But how else do we do this? Stores had a tough time as is policing mask wearing they just cannot possibly police vaccination Overall the anti-vaccination crowd will never change their tune At this point the remaining people that should be targeted are those who want to get a vaccine but are just dragging their feet Vaccination sites are everywhere now and you dont need an appointment Its free This move gives that middle group the last bit of incentive they may need,chozar,16212820630,3

h8f0php,p1oqh4,Its no shocker to me A lot of my family and friends live in Florida Back in late June i went down to surprise my father for his 69th birthday I thought since I was fully vaccinated and cases were at their lowest since the start of the pandemic there was never going to be a better time to go I hadnt seen him in 10 years I wasnt sure I would see him again so I took the risk and drove down This trip was highly unusual Normally I would get in contact with everyone and try to spend time with as many people as I could This was more a top secret mission Ive been paying attention to everyones social media posts I knew since i had a high risk son at home there were many folks I did not want to see (He has heart failure one kidney and immuno-compromised from a cancer diagnosis as a toddler)The need to know list was minimal Even though neither of my parents are vaccinated I knew it was ok to visit my father He is living off the system and had most things delivered at his home He only left to buy cigarettes and beer and got them at a window I asked my mom to get tested because she hasnt changed her way of living since all this started Anti masker bible thumping Christian who goes to church and Costco twice a week This church sets aside a half hour after service for fellowship community dining and affection(hugging and spreading love) I visited a handful of friends One group knew i was coming down before anyone else They all were fully vaccinated and quarantined themselves before I arrived Chatting with them made me realize that most Floridians just dont care about following the rules Its always been business as usual down there Theres been major events like concerts live DJ performances and parties weekly Ive seen tons of posts from packed venues Nobody wearing masks all crammed tightly in a building One night I visited my best friend since high school We got to chat while smoking a fat bowl (she bought a new piece just for me for my visit) and she said it perfectly "Florida just dont give a fuck about Covid" Its that frame of mind why Florida will be hit mega hard by this variant Theres a huge number of unvaccinated people down there You have the younger crowd partying like its 1999 mixing with a massive older retired population A recipe for disaster Even with this new variant and numbers skyrocketing they still just dont care With Summer coming to a close soon all of the snowbirds will start arriving again Just in time as the Delta is getting in gear I probably shouldnt have taken the drive down or seen as many people as I did But like I said cases were at their lowest and most of the small number of people I visited were vaccinated I caught a lot of flak once everyone found out I was down and never stopped in Those that knew I was coming also knew the situation with my son and took precaution Most of the time spent together was outdoors and distanced at a persons home The only home I went in was my Fathers I knew it was only a matter of time before a new variant swept through the Sunshine State Im glad I went when I did My dad is a chain smoker and ex hardcore drug addict I never once seen him eat when i was there Beer and cigarettes thats it Didnt matter if it was 8 in the morning or midnight Alcohol and nicotine If you heard him cough you would know he doesnt have much time left on Earth I had to go down to see him when the opportunity was there,ac1dre1gn77,16286075150,97

h8g1hqm,p1oqh4,I believe its really important for parents to have an idea of the risks of COVID to children so Ive been doing some research recently to assess the risks **I am not an expert -- so I welcome any comments -- but thought this may be helpful as parents navigate this worrisome time** (sorry if youve seen this before -- Ive reposted this on threads that talk about kids and COVID because I think its important to have some idea behind the risks): **Morality Risks:** Obviously theres an extremely fine line to walk here: every death of a child is horrendously tragic and I cannot imagine being the parent of a child who has died or been hospitalized The good news for parents however is that mortality risks still remain low [Out of 74000000 kids in the US 519 have died of COVID since the crisis began (as of July 28)](https://wwwnytimescom/2021/07/29/well/family/back-to-school-covidhtml) This works out to a mortality rate of 00007% or 0015% amongst those who had had confirmed cases of COVID Again this is immensely tragic -- simply put no child should die -- but if I were a parent Id probably be more worried about the prospects for long-term COVID symptoms (discussed below) **Risks of Delta:** Delta is new so there is still much we do not know However data from the UK (where Delta has hit for some time now) gives us some clues Lets start with the good news: [based on data from the UK kids remain the least impacted age group by a long shot](https://wwwonsgovuk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19latestinsights/hospitals#hospital-admissions-by-age)Despite not having access to vaccines kids age 5-14 still have had by far the lowest hospitalization rates of any demographic (this past week its been 108/100000; kids age 0-4 have had noticeably higher rates -- 312/100k -- though still lower than any other age group) Similarly the chance a child would be hospitalized if they had a confirmed case of COVID was similar to prior waves and maybe even a little bit lower The bad news? Well more kids are going to get Delta on account of it being more transmissible particularly in areas where schools arent taking any precautions We all know it and were seeing it now but Delta is insanely more transmissible The fact were already seeing records for hospitalizations amongst kids is extremely bad to say the least The fact this is already occurring with no indications cases nationally are close to peaking is really troubling (An aside: interestingly the UK never break their record for youth hospitalizations with Delta but were breaking it now I really dont know but if anyone has insight itd be interesting to hear) **Risks of Long COVID/The Disease Course More Generally:** We still have lots to learn about long COVID and Delta is new enough that current studies dont really address it For COVID more generally however the earliest studies suggested frighteningly high rates of long-lasting symptoms (one even pegged it at a third!) But these suffered from immense methodological weaknesses such as low sample sizes parental-reported symptoms probable selection bias and no control groups More recent research (which isnt perfect and still includes many of the above weaknesses but is at least somewhat better) has suggested much lower rates than the first studies albeit the risks are real A sampling of some of the more recent work include: * [In a self-reported survey in the UK over 95% of infected kids had no symptoms lasting longer than four weeks and 98% had no symptoms more than 56 days](https://wwwthelancetcom/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext)(and if Im understanding the study correctly it only analyzed kids with symptomatic COVID so there would be lower rates for all infections) * [In a survey from the UK of people who had COVID an estimated 74% of children aged 2-11 reported any symptoms 12 weeks after infection](https://wwwonsgovuk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/prevalenceofongoingsymptomsfollowingcoronaviruscovid19infectionintheuk/1april2021) (this study included a control group) * [In one study with a control group researchers found that kids infected with COVID in Zurich actually were no more likely to report symptoms of long-COVID than kids who were not infected](https://wwwnaturecom/articles/d41586-021-01935-7)To be clear: this study does not imply that long-Covid does not occur However if true it suggests the actual prevalence of long-COVID in kids is likely quite low (This is definitely the most encouraging study I found) So whats the average course of the illness in most children (again with the caveat that most research is pre-Delta)? First off it seems that \~50% of children will be totally asymptomatic ([the Lancet study](https://wwwthelancetcom/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext) cites a source suggesting between 43-68% of cases are asymptomatic) Of those with symptoms the one study found the median symptom duration is 6 days with the most common symptoms being headache and fatigue (see previous link) Three final notes: First we need to be careful when discussing long-COVID and differentiate between symptoms that are bad but manageable (and resolve over time) and symptoms which are debilitating Unfortunately to my understanding current research has not really addressed this adequately In the Lancet study at least (first bullet point) the most common symptoms that lasted in the children who had lasting symptoms were 1) fatigue 2) loss of smell and 3) (to a lesser degree) headaches This doesnt really resolve the question -- depending on the levels of fatigue for example it certainly can be debilitating -- but I think this is something we really shouldnt lose sight of when discussing long-COVID Second: Ive seen concerns on here about organ damage and the like I havent really seen great studies focusing on this on children (I very well may have missed some so do not take this as gospel) Moreover in the studies Ive run across on adults theres lots of jargon and its not always clear what the medical implications of certain findings are Thus I havent really focused on it here -- not because it might not exist but because its above my expertise and I do not want to misinterpret findings Third risks -- even quantified -- are hard to interpret and people will probably have different reactions to the same numbers Lets say [the Lancet study](https://wwwthelancetcom/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext) (showing 18% of children with symptomatic COVID have any symptoms lasting >56 days) is correct On the one hand -- if your child catches COVID -- this means he/she is extremely unlikely to have symptoms that last that long One the other hand -- this still means lots of kids will have symptoms that last a long time **Takeaways:** Building off this last point: people will look at the above data and likely come to different conclusions For me I look at it and feel somewhat reassured -- its not at all that theres zero risk (theres definitely not) and whats currently happening is absolutely tragic but the data speaks to somewhat lower risks than the impression Id likely get if I spent my whole day on this sub But then again Im also not a parent Others may look at the data (particularly the long-COVID studies) and still very reasonably feel worried **In any event -- and I know Im preaching to the choir here -- the most important thing you can do to protect the kids around you is get vaccinated And if you happen to be a parent with a children age 12 or over whos on the fence please get them vaccinated too Itll protect your child from a truly nasty disease and help lower the risk for those around your child too**,Adodie,16286229860,6

h8fkmbw,p1oqh4,I really appreciate https://covid19healthdataorg unlike other sites they are trying to predict how the virus behave it is not live I think they update it once a week (I would guess the computations are too expensive to run it in real time) Anyway in order to make good predictions they also need to have more accurate estimate about real infections https://covid19healthdataorg/united-states-of-america/florida?view=infections-testing&tab=trend&test=positive_tests If you adjust the graph to show the entire pandemic from the beginning and switch to "confirmed infections" you will see that the spike is getting there to the same numbers as in the winter It still havent hit the peak though Now switch to "estimated infections" It is almost three times as high as the highest peak during winter Estimating 90K/day infections,CSI_Tech_Dept,16286159150,4
h8fv8hj,p1oqh4,There are two factors at play here: * Floridas state ban on school mask mandates * Increased Transmission from Delta There have been some [pretty robust](https://wwwnytimescom/2021/08/10/opinion/covid-schools-maskshtml) [studies](https://abcsciencecollaborativeorg/report-shows-that-n-c-k-12-schools-reopened-safely-paving-the-way-for-schools-nationwide-to-limit-covid-19-spread-in-the-classroom/) that show that at least for last years variants in-person education had very low transmission rates so long as everyone was wearing masks So the question is how much of this transmission is due to students not masking and how much is due to the increased transmission rate of the Delta variant? As the parent of kids who are in a school district thats headed back to in-person-with-masks-required school in a few weeks my hope is that masks are still effective enough to allow for safe in-person learning until under-12s can get vaccinated But we really dont know that yet If my kids were headed back to school tomorrow with the data we have available today in an environment where masks are required Id likely send them with N95 masks But well see what things look like in a few weeks when I have to make that decision for realsies,AtOurGates,16286203390,3

Also I have an autoimmune disorder I have had flares with this and other vaccines I am a little concerned about the inflammation from multiple vaccines Even though risk analysis is that the virus is riskier than the vaccine at what point does that start to no longer be the case?

guk21nd,mqz31i,Today the Stanford health Vaccination clinic was a mess Crowded lines inside the building starting from the fourth floor working down the stairs No temp checks or sanitizers 2 hours to get through the appointment while the vaccine part of the process took only minutes The rest of the time was validating paperwork and taking insurance info They made it come across as there is no cost for the vaccine but there is an 80 dollar administration fee charged to insurance Horrible bedside manner way too long spent holding people in a tight space so their insurance could be collected and billed too while all their other info had been collected well in advance Im sure that people would be scared away by the poor communication It freaked my family out and we have insurance and could pay the cost if we had known we were expected to The posting on their website describes it only slightly better by elaborating that its insurance or the government being billed it wasnt announced anywhere vibrantly during the registration and appointment process but wow was money the focus today It was way weird especially in contrast to my experience going to Sutters drive through clinic where I was a respected human being from start to finish Everyone should be comfortable going to get their vaccine but im certain many will be scared off by treatment like that,Iamyouarewewillbe,16184500520,2

gukdqab,mqz31i,I wonder how many people are like me in that Im seriously concerned about side effects of the shot I was a premie and was stabbed with so many needles that it took me a long time to get a flu shot I got so friggin sick in December 2019 that I fear feeling the same thing from the vaccine Dry cough for 2 weeks took so many decongestive medicines and nothing Fever chills lack of taste/smell but not sure how noticeable as Covid wasnt a known thing The cough was so bad that i was scared to cough and while waiting at the hospital lobby for my physical for my job i coughed and my body locked up At the time I was in the process of getting my job in another state and had to drive the 10+ hours one way That was pure hell Was it Covid? Dunno not a doctor Ive had the flu before but this was something else SO got the shot its a matter of time before i need to but Im scared to death of the side effects Not trying to come off as antivax just anxiety I wear my mask everywhere edit: Sooooooo I did the thing for the greater good and took the shot Definitely teetered on the edge of anxiety and panic as I hate needles Had a staph/blood infection in my finger a long time ago and they inserted the needle from the tip of my finger downward about 1/4in so that was the most intense pain didnt feel anything on this covid shot but now im waiting for crappy symptoms,exccord,16184563220,2
gujcfyn,mqz31i,It is NOT free It is either covered by your insurance or the government is covering the cost with more borrowed money You may not have to pay for it at time of service but I can assure you the vaccine maker/distributor/administrator is getting money for their product and/or services I am not saying we should be doing it any other way but free is not a word I would use to describe the vaccine,sskj2016,16184368980,-13
