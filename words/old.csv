ho1fm7h,rdg5q3,If anyone thinks that child sex trafficking is fake news then you havent been paying attention to what happens every year in our country and the poorest countries around the world! These people prey on the poor just as they abuse them for work they also use them for their own devious purposes! This is as old as our history MEN have sought out the vulnerable and taken advantage of them and abused them for whatever purpose they wanted! As a survivor of this type of destructive behavior it has taken me a long time to realize that it wasnt my fault but it breaks you down piece by piece until you start self medicating and then you are deemed a delinquent though the judges and lawyers know what happens when a child is thrust into something like this they have no compassion for the children they add abuse on top of the abuse! We have tried to bury this stuff for too long and it is time for those who are elected to protect and serve have to be held accountable and forced to start doing their job! I could tell all of the heart wrenching stories but it will not help to change some of the peoples minds that are in charge! The only time that they come close to caring is when it happens to a child of status and even then they try to bury it! They have the money to pay off the officials in the right places and it just keeps happening! I spent most of my life with anger and self medication and it hasnt really been much help I hope that this is a start to holding them accountable maybe this one woman will open the door for all to see just how pervasive this really is but she is going to have to draw a roadmap to how these people do the things they do!

hns8ztz,rc13h3,This just confirms what Donald marshall explained happened to him He says that he was sold into illuminati program by his parents When goes to sleep as everyone does his consciousness apparently was transferred to an exact clone of his body in a secret facility (Only by sleeping was the transfer able to happen because your brain wave frequency changes during sleep) In this facility he was raped and tortured by elites who were also in clone versions of themselves By his account queen Elizabeth was the one running things there as far as he could tell Because everyone is a clone if you die there you wont die in real life you will just wake up in the body you went to sleep in In this facility the queen allegedly loved to see people and children get slaughtered in a large dirt pit stadium they had there They can kill you multiple times and just create another clone for you to be in You can still feel pain as a clone how you normally would He described how the queen would threaten people with torture if they didnt do what she wanted (such as a child refusing to sword fight to the death another child) The queen apparently likes being a clone more than real life and goes on power trips in the clone facility The queen also likes watching horses being dismembered alive because of the screams they make Donald Marshall was kept alive because he made a massive amount of music for the illuminati and they would torture him to write it The song bigger than us by white lies was written by Donald marshal about how princess Diana was assassinated by the queen and royal family One lyric is " you went where the horses cry youve never gone that way with me before did you feel the need for change" Diana asked her driver if he felt the need for change when he didnt use the route she always asked for Donald Marshall was keeping a paper trail of things he had learned in the facility in his songs I could keep going for pages of text but you can find the details at the Donald Marshall forum on Proboards,tendlos,16390065460,1

he wrote a White House official that he was in favor of a "National Endowment in support of free institutions throughout the world" >The NED was initially placed under the auspices of the National Security Council and one Walter Raymond Jr a CIA propaganda expert who according to the late Robert Parry for years acted as liaison between the program and Casey Raymond also drew charming doodles like this depicting himself as a literal puppeteer controlling many different strings >The organization was stacked with prominent neoconservatives like Lane Kirkland John Richardson and Allen Weinstein Carl Gershman a longtime professional anticommunist was its first and so far only president One of its current board members Elliott Abrams is a war criminal with a history of subverting democracy overseas >To prevent the odor of US imperialism from contaminating the NEDs work the Reagan administration made it a private organization that in turn funded several more private institutions including the NDI and IRI But the fact that it was routinely staffed with former US officials and got its funding from the US government has always made this a dubious conceit >Equally dubious was the idea that its task was simply to promote democracy Two of its "core grantees"  which receive around 70 percent of its funding  are explicitly right wing: the IRI which is a GOP-led institution that once described its goals as advancing "democracy the rule of law and free-market economics"; and the Center for International Private Enterprise a project of the **US Chamber of Commerce** Even the Solidarity Center (formerly the Free Trade Union Institute) which is affiliated with the **AFL-CIO** went on to support conservative causes Only the NDI the Democrats arm could be said to be anywhere left of center Overall the NEDs track record tilts decidedly to the right CIPE and The Solidarity Center are two of the four grantees of the [NED](https://wwwsolidaritycenterorg/national-endowment-for-democracy-ned-ndi-iri-cipe-and-solidarity-center-welcome-increased-funding-from-congress/) NED does what the CIA used to do behind closed doors I thought the NED was pretty interesting considering Time Magazines story about the secret shadow campaign to save the [2020 election](https://timecom/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/) The article mentions multiple times how the group was working to protect and save Democracy (democracy is used ~33 times in the article) The article also outlines an alliance that included the AFL-CIO and the US Chamber of Commerce: >The pact was formalized in a terse little-noticed joint statement of the US Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO published on Election Day This article from [socialismcom](https://socialismcom/fs-article/betrayal-from-venezuela-to-iraq-the-afl-cio-and-the-national-endowment-for-democracy/) discusses how NED is a CIA front is funded by the US government and works closely with the leaders of the AFL-CIO: >A little-known far-right organization with a warm and fuzzy name the National Endowment for Democracy is up to no good in at least 40 countries That is bad enough especially given that the money for NEDs dirty deeds comes from working taxpayers courtesy of the US Congress Truly appalling however is the role that leaders of the AFL-CIO the largest US labor federation play in carrying out the work of this agency > A CIA front is born During the late 1970s the CIA was exposed for its active sabotage of numerous governments and progressive labor movements abroad Not so publicized was the AFL-CIOs role in aiding the CIA >Operating through the American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD) the AFL-CIO aided the overthrow of democratically elected governments in Guyana in 1963 Brazil in 1964 the Dominican Republic in 1965 and Chile in 1973 These are just a few examples of labor officialdoms shameful record in helping to carry out corporate-propelled US foreign policy >In 1983 after the CIA was widely discredited Ronald Reagans administration created a new agency the NED to take care of old business As an NED founder Allen Weinstein put it in 1991: "A lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA" >In his hard-hitting book Rogue State: A Guide to the Worlds Only Superpower William Blum describes some of the agencys activities "NED successfully manipulated elections in Nicaragua in 1990 and Mongolia in 1996 helped to overthrow democratically elected governments in Bulgaria in 1990 and Albania in 1991 and 1992 and was busy working in Haiti in the late 1990s on behalf of rightwing groups **NED like the CIA before it calls what it does supporting democracy** The governments and movements whom the NED targets call it destabilization" From the [Time 2020 election story:](https://timecom/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/) >"The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation" says Norm Eisen >The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation >The system didnt work magically Democracy is not self-executing" >And they believe the public needs to understand the systems fragility in order to ensure that democracy in America endures,Settlemente,16187557890,1

gz7qcsx,njg4a5,Abe Saffron from in Sydney Australia had an illegal brothel with a two way mirror and cameras that would record local politicians and businessmen in compromising positions (similar to Epsteins set up in his NY house) This was then used to blackmail and get what he wanted for himself and his colleagues Saffron was rich and powerful but still a small time hustler In contrast Epstein had such an extensive network of friends (customers) and contacts - world leaders captains of industry police royalty and the judiciary If his scheme was only for small time personal gain - he wasted his talents especially when he was already filthy rich Epstein came from off the radar and immerged with the daughter of a tycoon and mossad agent to rub sholders with the parasites Epstein got to the position he had via the design of many individuals The resources personnel and contacts that a foreign agency could wield in such an endeavour would be limitless Especially if it cultivates the type of weapons grade evidence that Epstein collected What I find interesting is why he got his burn notice - did he step out of line did he compromise the wrong person did he get sloppy in the end was there a regime change?,LiWang1,16218113690,6

If anything is true it is that people are puppets and they will follow their puppet master!!! I raise both of my hands but I know that this is the end of the case!

gwl09mj,n2nxhj,I remember this her family made a really big deal about it If I remember right her dad actually formed his own team to investigate when he became suspicious at how the military was handling things So it was her dad that discovered all of these injuries after the army officially declared a suicide and were rushing for a full honors burial I think she was actually buried at a military cemetery and the father exhumed her just for the sake of doing the autopsy independently Without the fathers suspicion we would have never known the truth "Johnson formed his own investigative team enlisting the help of family members who have studied criminal science For eight years they have pored over the investigation documents; studied the horrifying photographs; analyzed witness statements Johnson doesnt mince words: He believes his daughter was raped and murdered her death covered up Johnson says he had to find the strength to look at the autopsy photos of his daughter  and to examine her body before the funeral In 2007 he made another difficult decision: having her body exhumed for an independent autopsy" - [source](https://newsstlpublicradioorg/government-politics-issues/2015-07-19/10-years-later-a-soldiers-family-still-grieves-and-questions-the-armys-version-of-her-death) Edit - I misremembered some facts Her father did not perform the autopsy he hired some one to do a second autopsy after exhuming her body I apologize for any confusion,I_say_alot_of_things,16199014760,1549
gwmpirj,n2nxhj,The totality of evidence surrounding Private Johnsons execution-style murder strongly suggests that the person who killed her is former four-star Army General **Kevin P Byrnes** He was third in seniority among the Armys eleven generals at the time Byrnes who was appointed to his command position by President George W Bush in November 2002 headed the Armys Training and Doctrine Command (1st Cavalry Division) or TRADOC command In this capacity Byrnes supervised the recruitment and academic programs at thirty-three Army schools from basic training to the war colleges Private Johnson met General Byrnes in July 2005 just a couple of days before her death As fate would have it Private Johnson wrote his name in her personal notepad and told her father about her one-on-one conversation with him She had no way of knowing at the time that Byrnes (a) was engaged in an extramarital affair with a civilian female and (b) had been ordered by **General Peter J Schoomaker** the Armys Chief of Staff to end the affair Byrnes who was married willfully disobeyed Schoomakers order and instead elected to make his love affair more clandestine In doing so Byrnes risked being court-martialed for disobeying Schoomakers lawful and direct order Extramarital affairs among military generals while strictly prohibited by the military are not unusual Sometimes these affairs lead to reckless impulsive and even criminal conduct as the participants do everything within their power to indulge in the affairs under a cloak of secrecy The torrid love affair between **General David Petreaus** and his lover **Paula Broadwell** is a recent high profile example of this type of deceitful reckless conduct and criminal conduct Like Petreaus General Byrnes TRADOC command gave him the means and opportunity to practice the deception that accompanied his adultery Like Petreaus Byrnes found ways to evade the Pentagons scrutiny of his extramarital affair particularly after Byrnes was ordered to stop his affair Byrnes illicit love affair came to light only after his unanticipated encounter with Private Johnson caused its exposure During the early morning hours of July 19th Private Johnson inadvertently encountered General Byrnes engaging in the very romance he had been ordered to stop She was alone at the time because the Army never assigned Private Johnson a "battle buddy" to accompany her around the base Private Johnsons discovery of Byrnes continued adultery left him startled afraid and desperate Byrnes snapped and became violent toward Private Johnson who did not fight back because she was as shocked as he was and because Byrnes was her TRADOC commander During his assault on Private Johnson Byrnes knocked some of her teeth backwards broke her nose fractured her neck and inflicted other serious injuries on her body Private Johnson was then dragged into a contractors tent where Byrnes staged the crime scene to make it look like Private Johnson had committed suicide,jdhyp13,16199356390,5

h2m38om,o543q5,Hey Fuck banks I had an account with SunTrust and some of their policies were straight up scams The one that got me was how they dont accept deposits after 9pm but they will absolutely clear pending charges at all times of the night So when I deposited cash through the ATM the deposit didnt clear into morning But some pending charges all went through at night which overdrafted my account But then also the overdraft fee comes out before the deposit Another good one Your "current balance" in their app can be totally inaccurate Ive had them tell me this The current balance may not always be accurate So you have to keep track yourself Then what good is your stupid app? And my favorite conspiracy theory on banks? I swear banks intentionally hold pending charges when your account gets below a certain point And wait until you make another purchase Then bam! Send all the pending charges through at once overdrafting your account with the last purchase I cant prove this but Ive seen charges sit pending in my account for 2-3 weeks Then all go through all at once after I use my debit card thinking the charges have cleared And another conspiracy theory How do we know banks arent skimming fractions of pennies from every charge from every customer?

That could work" The implied advice is actually good advice if you are looking to save money it just comes across as patronizing and hypocritical for a bank to be saying it due to the fact that they make their money off of loans And yet despite this being nothing more than a hypocritical joke somehow people managed to become convinced that it highlights a secret motive of banks(despite that secret motive being a well known one) I swear this sub is the Redgrin Grumble of knowing whats going on *I dont think the joke formula used counts as a meme but I have no clue what else to describe it as beyond "joke formula" and that sounds too formal for my mock scenario so meme it is,TheLastBallad,16243402010,1

hmqllrs,r602yz,Good on you dude! This is a prime example of how much better society could function if we didnt all just sit around assuming someone else will take care of this issue especially such a morally corrupt one like exploiting kids So many people just assume this is what the FBI or police handle at best theyll report it but then theyll move on and likely that monster continues making a profit on the exploitation of children So its rad to see you actually took it upon yourself to see this through and its great to see at least one piece of filth has now had their legs cut out from beneath them Id be really cautious about working with anyone from the FBI though Especially after recent events seeing how the FBI has been so directly involved with instigating events like the "kidnapping" of Governor Whitmer the January 6 FBI-lead event and the 2020 rioting Not to mention the FBIs history of covering up real proven child trafficking/exploitation operations This isnt even touching all of the speculation (without much evidence) about the FBI being directly involved in protecting the large child trafficking/porn producers if not actively participating in the creation of it themselves Not to say the ***entire*** FBI is corrupt filled with monsters who wont just ignore these sorts of charges theyll actively work to cover-up and bury it then silence you But it certainly seems like the integral cogs in the FBI machine are not very concerned with really digging deep into who operates the major trafficking/child porn productioncould be theyre involved in the facilitation themselves or the sad reality the FBI is morally corrupt ineffectual dinosaur institution who will no longer or can no longer uphold their duty to justice :/,flichter,16383217060,6

hid9v3j,qh1mh5,I believe adderall has many benefits taken as prescribed for those who have ADHD I was the Ritalin generation which was prescribed to me It had its pros and cons My attention span increased and my grades were exponentially better Yet the side effects loss of appetite irritability cold sweats and depression were the reasons I stopped taking it I never did get prescribed adderall yet my boyfriend has been on it for several years He is 59 years old and takes it as prescribed with no ill side effects I have taken it before and I think its hugely helpful in focus I also think it has the ability to open parts of the mind for a person to see things in life they may never have seen because of all the distractions Its not surprising that the diagnosis rate from ADD has become so prevalent The world is full of things that are meant to distract Apps on cellphones and video games are purposefully filled with content that triggers the addiction part of the brain The creators are trying to get you hooked So I believe adderall is far less detrimental and may be beneficial at stopping the triggering effect of all the other manufactured distractions One more thing I want to say about ADD This condition is actually an asset As I have gotten older and learned behavior management I have good multi tasking skills can think outside the box and when I find something of interest I become hyperfocused and will not relent until I figure it out or finish People diagnosis with ADD are some of the most creative and forward thinking people I know,katiekat122,16354207410,1

i0zezv3,tg0kom,I posted this almost a year ago and have kept copying and pasting it because a lot of it has come true since then Ill warn you its long though This is a copy from another post but lines up the events of history that are being copied right now And why so many *Financial Issues* are being disguised (such as climate issues or pandemic issues) But a lot of this has happened before and is being full-on copied from other time periods and how even blackrock (the single largest hedge fund and called "The Fourth Branch of the US Government by Forbes and Bloomberg) [wrote the entire financial blueprint of what was going to happen before covid even started back in August 2019](https://wwwblackrockcom/corporate/literature/whitepaper/bii-macro-perspectives-august-2019pdf) Were seeing a complete system change why we needed to pump out a ton of money (literally 40% of all Dollars in existence were created in the last year) and why we need a WORLDWIDE unique Identification system tied to single individuals and a unique ID (a passport that is financial in its requirement but right now is being pushed through medical global requirements) Corona is a financial issue disguised as a pandemic issue because it can circumvent local laws and force the wordlwide laws Climate change is a financial issue being disguised as an ecosystem issue because again those laws are "bigger" than local laws and can circumvent normal procedures ----- We know "follow the money" to be the oldest and truest sense of deducing whats going on One of the things that stands out is that this event is following exactly the same events of the 20s and 70s Both times marked by huge inflation both times marked by a currency change and a new system and both times marked by a war that took place to get rid of the old system and expand the system while countries are hit hard by inflation But they all follow the same play ook = a massive amount of money was printed out and a certain assets price was then crashed that people were holding onto In the 20s-30s the asset was gold (whos price skyrocketed as money was printed and then crashed right before a market crash) and now with crypto currency (bitcoin was $7200 in january 2020 and got up to $60000 before crashing down to $32000 and flying back up to $65000 again and will probably crash even further once again before the final drop before it raises to crazy levels in ten years) In the case of gold the conspiracy is that two men formed a group and tried to corner the market and then the US released all its gold shares to crash that market and everyone sold their gold the US then used that price to buy gold from people and then backed the dollar with gold and even made owning it illegal alsoone of those two men who tried cornering the market was the Presidents brother in law so it was clearly a setup and a lot of people lost money but the US gained a lot of gold at cheaper prices right before switching the currency to be backed by gold So it was all about currency So why is the same thing happening again? August was the 50th year anniversary of Nixon ending the gold backed dollar in the 70s and starting the petro backed dollar So what does the end of the currency look like? Remember I said there was a crash for gold because the US released all its stores and crashed the market? Well guess [who owns the most bitcoin](https://wwwwiredcom/2013/12/fbi-wallet/)? Well for starters everyone will need a personal wallet (hence a vaccine passport for tracking is going to come sooner or later but this is the best excuse) The current chair of the SEC (Gary Gensler) who was installed in April taught a class about crypto currency at MIT Sloane (which is an enlightening resource if you want to see how officials view crypto currencies) He even talks about bitcoin finishing a 10 year testing phase and how it survived {what does that even mean? I thought Satoshi Nakamoto was an anonymous person I thought crypto was all about a decentralized financial platform and yet the current head of the SEC says it survived a testing phase?} So what else do we know signifies the end of the petro dollar? Weve all seen how much climate change pops up Well plastics are part of the oil system and thats part of the end too is my guess I know people think its an environmental factor for climate change but we all know that the biggest changes arent happening (a very tiny percentage accounts for the most pollutants but nothing is done about those) But following the money its clear that climate change is a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue This is extremely clear because two separate Senate and house committees met with banks in May about climate changewhy would they meet with banks instead of oil companies or manufacturers? Again the evidence points to a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue But theyre pushing us simply to change what system we consume while avoiding the largest climate change pollutants And even ending the oil system next is energy sourcingwell enter in Afghanistan popping up again and the Taliban/ISIS (which is where the largest lithium deposit is) But the key point is that we will move off of seaparate working grids (because even if you steal gasoline it still works on your vehicle) onto one grid that uses unique identification (which electrical vehicles already do but again is part of the movement away from the machine driven system and into the computer/tracking system) And what about the old infrastructure? Have you noticed how all those hacking attacks kept happening to old infrastructure key points? And the hackers keep asking other countries for huge amount of bitcoin? Have you noticed how war keeps popping up involving all those countries on the old system? Must be a complete coincidence Im sure But well know for sure this is the case if the market crashes soon Hyperinflation is close and technically happening but the FED refuses to acknowledge it (crazy how we dont vote for the FED president and yet they control the entire economy) Weve now had the largest 12 month increase in inflation since 1983 The CPI has changed over and over how inflation is measured true inflation is estimated anywhere from 13% - 25% (but you already know that and likely got your rent hiked already up 20% year-over-year) Thats what happened in the 30s right as they switched to a new backing for the dollar (with Gold) and were seeing all the signs present now that this is true If were about to end the machine driven age and start the computer driven stage then we would each need a unique wallet address and a passport can accompany that It would be the easiest way to install worldwide tracking (since crypto provides a ledger for everything) Also well know bitcoin prices will shoot through the roof after a crash if all this is true and happens Either way this ties corona (an excuse for mass printing of money) the vaccine (more money and a unique wallet tied to ID) end of petro dollar and machine age (climate change is a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue end of plastics from oil) end of the retail to stores system and move to full digital marketplace the beginning of the crypto dollar and crashing the crypto markets (already happened but still can drop much farther along with the rest of the market similar to exact same scenarios in the past) Were entering into the most tracked age of all time everything on the planet will be tracked back to unique ids and monitored on a blockchain/verified by a computer "The Great Reset" might sound like a conspiracy meme but thats an awful lot of coordination to happen in a short period of time Even better since I wrote this the IMF and 10 countries got together in Israel and [Simulated a Cyber Attack that would shut down the Global Financial System](https://financeyahoocom/news/exclusive-imf-10-countries-simulate-133015124html) Im sure thats just a coincidence too! Im sure once it happens everyone will be shocked and demand answersthat they already have Its coming my guess is at the start of Bidens second term since thats when they did it with Nixon Ill keep writing this and if Im wrong I will stop but weve been checking off each point from that paper by Blackrock ever since corona started Every company put money back into their company and was given a massive amount with the PPP loans and every country matched financial and monetary policies and was given massive amounts of money during corona Soif the market started showing signs of a massive failure in 2019 and this paper was put out in August 2019 and weve followed every item line by line of this outline since then and it came before coronathen what does that say about corona This was the single largest robbery in history and unless you are in the 1% then you are going to be the one paying for it You paid for it not just with two full years of your life hearing about this you didnt just pay by having communities torn apart or having to hear people argue about things that arent the actual problem you didnt just pay for it by having to actually stay in solitary confinement that includes the ability to watch your phone and the internetyou literally are going to actually pay for the rest of your life with the inflation costs and debt Well see if this is rightbut weve already checked off most the points from that paper The rich got so insanely rich since this happened It was literally the best year for Wall Street but how was it for most people?,garthsworld,16474938020,2

gwe22ao,n13x8h,Law enforcement in itself is not about justice Theyre order-followers And order-followers do as theyre told with no thought of their own about whether its right or wrong - for a paycheck Once you understand who is *really* giving the orders the Epstein situation makes perfect sense Heres a clue: Notice the black & white chess-board symbolism police wear around their heads? The occult meaning for that: Not knowing the difference between right & wrong Police officers owners and they *do* have owners put that symbolism there intentionally as a form of mockery They put it directly around police officers brains Their owners laugh hysterically about this behind closed doors The problem is those who work in law enforcement have confused man-made law with actual justice (Natural Law) They dont see the difference - and there is an *enormous* difference They need an understanding of Natural Law and there is a lot of effort put forth to hide knowledge of Natural Law from the public Natural Law is logic-based and contains absolute truths about morality Man-made laws on the other hand involve people writing down that they have "authority" over others and then mind-controlling the public into believing that makes that authority real Of course it doesnt in reality But the reason things like Epsteins death are allowed to happen is because the people working in law enforcement simply do as theyre told by their higher-ups regardless of whether its actually right or wrong No real improvement will occur for humanity in terms of all these conspiracies until far more people begin understanding Natural Law and applying it to their actions instead of believing in the supposed "authority" of government Thats the root of the problem for *all* conspiracies - and the solution We are quickly running out of time to do this And the vast majority of people believe in the legitimacy of the authority of government right now That needs to change Were nowhere near where we need to be with not much time left Anyone reading this please help spread the word about Natural Law Look into it for yourself if you dont know about it,Law_of_1,16197586280,3

h9a3aa2,p5wmdj,Its not the fault of any one person As a country over 70% of us wanted to invade Afghanistan after 9/11 I was one of those people Until 2009 over 70% of us thought we should stay There are legitimate criticisms that can be leveled at Trump Biden Obama and Bush but it should not stop there We sent 2 trillion dollars of our money over there thousands of lives and altered life for countless American families But it all collapsed in 10 days No matter how bad the president is he isnt bad enough to be responsible for ineptitude on such a massive scale We knew there was a massive problem when we first began to train their soldiers International Security Assistance Force or better known as ISAF is where the major problem lies For one our military personnel quickly gave ISAF a new moniker "I suck at fighting" The majority of the recruits that joined the Afghan military were extremely poor recruits Take a look at this video of our troops training Afghans to do jumping jacks https://youtube/QdggP7rw0mg To be fair there were exceptions to this rule and some Afghans turned out to be great fighters The problem however is that they were few and far between The next issue is that all of this was thought up by a group of bureaucrats who played it like they would in any Western country To give ISAF "credibility" they sought out local "authorities" to sign on Those authorities were the mujiahdeen warlords These are the same warlords that started the Afghan civil war in the 90s So these warlords used ISAF as a piggy bank for the next 20 years Providing token compliance but nothing more This is all to say that our plans should have changed years ago We tried one strategy and it sucked but we couldnt admit we were wrong so we just kept pumping resources into it Im short Afghanistan is the sunk cost fallacy on a monumental scale Anyone responsible for propping this plan up are the real ones we need to blame Yes our presidents are in that group but they are far from the only ones,rhm54,16292019550,2

hv1ixj6,sh2zq9,growing up in catholic school a lot of books were banned for us to be allowed to read in school or personally bc it "created an idealistic narrative that differs from what we believe" no LOTR no harry potter no golden compass most roald dahl etcetc i would hide books in the library that i was afraid would get banned,Gold-Ad9191,16436618910,1

hv202n6,sh2zq9,So the wording of the First Amendment starts out "Congress shall make no laws " It actually says that **Congress** cant make any laws that restrict freedom of speech It doesnt say that I cant ban a book in my household or that a school librarian cant remove books from his shelves because they are inappropriate for the age class he serves No one banned you from buying a book did they?

hv0vqg4,sh2zq9,Its a terrible thing all around no matter who does it But if we are going to be meticulous about the terms we are using it is not conservatives doing this It is Republican liberals doing this Why do I say this? Book banning/burning has inherently collectivist goals of managing the perceptions of a group for a future purpose Beyond the political the terms conservative and liberal are psychological and we have both of these tendencies inside of us Our liberal side seeks adventure into the unknown to break free remove borders (of all kinds not just physical) to explore new territories geographical mental etc Our conservative side seeks order limits borders a place to call home a way to hold together the protection which surrounds us whether its the walla of the house or thr family etc Actual conservatives realize that free speech maintains the order which keeps us safe enough to go out and explore with a moral center strong enough to not trample others in the process Our problem here with book banning isnt conservatives its liberals,a1Drummer07,16436532490,-1

It doesnt really matter in the end Nothing does And this philosophy of "nothing really matters in the end" - this is the ontological heart of western liberalism Its all a bunch of ad-hoc "guesstimating" which may be sophisticated in its planning but completely stupid at its philosophical foundation I remember watching a lecture a long long time ago when I was a different person On one side of the debate was the fiery Rabbi Meir Kahane notorious for his impassioned zionism and his own aspirations to become a leader in Israeli politics Kahane had a very charismatic personality as it was impossible not to like him; also he seemed to understand the decadence at the core of western civilization philosophy and culture which spoke to me On the other hand Kahane was militantly jingoistic in much of his rhetoric and often advocated policies that seemed a bit insane - like totally inviting the rancor of the surrounding world upon the Jewish state On the other side of the debate was a poinderextery Alan Dershowitz With his curly hair bushy mustache short posture and his trademark brazenness Dershowitz was arguing on the side of "liberalism" and its value to human life It was a good debate Interesting It was Kahanes charmisma versus Dershowitz yelling And despite being such a short and unattractive guy - there is something unusually energetic about Dershowitz If you listen to this man speak he really seems to believe exactly what he says It seems impossible to think that he is simply "lawyering" you yet this is what hes doing What kind of minds do people like alan dershowitz have? It seems strange and unusually Unnerving even Something odd Uncanny unfamiliar Could it be this man speaks with a forked tongue? How many politicians convey what seems like sincerity - and is indeed sincerity - yet is a false sincerity a weaponized sincerity a killing you with kindness type of orientation A person who experiences his embodiment as a tool to be used and not something to be identified with In short it is simply astonishing how utterly different a human life can feel On one end are the aggrandizers who *weaponize kindness love and compassion to suit their own aggrandizing ends* Its astonishingly disingenuous cold and cruel These people feel in short fundamentally invulnerable On the other end is the reverse situation; people so enfeebled and tortured by life that they will adopt any posture rule and quality - typically will abide by the structure of reality - in order to live unmolested by negative feelings To feel peace in other words - albeit such peace necessitating a tolerant attitude to experiences of discomfort and pain,SockMaximum,16408904710,0

hmgdleq,r45a5n,I remember when this was first discovered/posted on r/conspiracy back when she was arrested in 2020 and the account suddenly went dark It was fascinating to watch it come together in real time This information had better be a part of the prosecutions case in the trial Ill tell you why Im 99% sure personally that /u/maxwellhill was Lady Ghislaine herself I also am about 75% sure Aaron Swartz unearthed EVERYTHING related to Jeffrey&Ghislaine/Intelligence Agencies/human trafficking/political blackmail/Moloch when he hacked the MIT research lab which Jeffrey was a prominent associate of Aaron hacked the private servers there and found something he was NOT supposed to find and was soon charged with such extreme punishments by the court system which led to his suicide (I have no reason to think he was assassinated but of course it wouldnt surprise me Look up [the relationship between Courtney Love and her father/The Grateful Dead/CIA/MKUltra](https://covertactionmagazinecom/2021/07/21/u-s-intelligence-coverup-newly-declassified-fbi-file-on-nirvanas-kurt-cobain-compounds-evidence-implicating-his-wifes-role-in-his-murder/) Kurt was likely assassinated by these forces for being a political thorn in their side to a much lesser degree than Aaron was becoming Smart skilled young men who competently buck the system are their worst nightmare and must be *crucified*) Aaron died in 2013 and /u/maxwellhill IIRC showed up as a high level account around 2012 The SOPA/PIPA protests spearheaded by Aaron and others in his circle were around 2012 and their success put Aaron on the elites map in a bad way Then when he found whatever he found hacking MIT he became a HUGE problem for their scheme Poor kid probably had no idea what to do with himself 26 years old and to discover all this by yourself and to live with it alone? Think of the emotional trauma we have all endured in the last years as all this has come out and weve had each other to get through it all Aaron had no one He was probably absolutely fucked in the head/heart by the time he died You know maybe I dont know 100% if any of this is true But it sure does add up Also the McGraw-Hill textbook company (the makers of all our K-12 school history textbooks) is owned by the Maxwell family So /u/maxwellhill controls the narrative just as McGraw-Hill does Its a cute pun Ill give her that,umbertostrange,16381375500,124

hmf92b3,r45a5n,So I presume everyone who hangs out in a place like this understands *what* exactly Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeff Epstein *were* They were spies working for a foreign nation who utilized child sex slaves as one means of extortion and control over their targets Their targets included at least one US administration which they successfully controlled They also included field-leading scientists in areas ranging from genetics through cryptography media social media all the way to orbital launch and space flight In the world of espionage there are assets agents who develop the assets case officers who develop and manage the agents and powers that tell the case officers what to do Layers of separation meant to keep the hands of the shot-callers clean Epstein was an asset; Maxwell was an agent Both quite obviously worked for Mossad The Maxwell-Epstein team even targeted Elon Musk though apparently unsuccessfully much like the Bronfman-sponsored NXIVM mind control/sex traffic cult team successfully targeted Richard Branson of Virgin fame even celebrating their capture by holding parties on Bransons private island [They had predecessors](https://iimgurcom/gH04jObjpg) who controlled previous US administrations through similar means The existence of such creatures across the breadth of US history suggests that there are most likely teams doing similar things currently in operation One such team recently targeted congressman Matt Gaetz; their operation was disrupted and two members of their team are already in federal custody The rest are known Now you must understand something else While Ghislaine Maxwells cell of this team has been deactivated there are remnant cells in the form of Maxwells sisters who wrote much of the code the US government uses at a federal level to track the movements of people keep out terrorists and keep the borders of America secure This granted the Maxwell team the ability to traffic in humans in undetectable fashion around the world as well as facilitate the completely clandestine movements of VIPs around the world In short not the kind of people you want in charge of your fundamental natsec backbone software Now you understand why Maxwell had a pilots and a submariners license Now you understand why Nadia Marcinkova another member of the Maxwell-Epstein team remains a pilot and remains at large Now you understand why all the other members of the Maxwell-Epstein team are still at large: theyre completely in charge of your government those higher powers that tell the cells what to do and whom to target Woodrow Wilson had a relevant quote about these hidden powers,KorvaxNaniteJelly,16381213780,66

i0egqpb,tcdedn,This is not truth this stance doesnt even make sense to me this is just a pussy way to say that you are afraid of Russia and you blame Ukraine and the US for "poking the bear" Its an attempt to show a neutral stance but shows a lack of recognition of events UN/NATO never threatened Russian sovereignty or the country at all Ukraine never threatened Russian sovereignty The US never threatened Russian sovereignty However Russia threatens Ukrainian sovereignty and the sovereignty of other nations like Georgia since 2008 and Moldova Putin is threatening nuclear war if we dont let him get what he wants Russia has waged proxy wars similar to the Ukrainian proxy war that started in 2014 that made the recognition of the DPR and LPR areas possible for a long time Ukraine voted 92% in favor of independence from Russia when the USSR fell NATO is a defensive alliance and independent countries should be able to choose their security agreements Especially considering these smaller countries (that are smaller than Ukraine) are obviously at risk from Russian interest Ukraine used to be Russia but by that logic alot of our countries would not be considered legitimate The US did back a coup in Ukraine in 2014 against a man Putin put in charge the same way he rigs his own elections all these years The Ukrainian people fought for the change in government so they could have their own and I find it funny how many Americans want to criticize wanting to change their government with help from another country As if American independence wasnt funded by France The only threat NATO poses to Russia is to Russian oligarch interest in invading countries or waging proxy wars to gain territory for "security" or resources So the reason why its offensive is bc its stupid,BigDisco6,16471117520,1

I really do not remember in any history of a war undertaken with such combined injustice and baseness Ordinary wars of conquest are to me far less wicked than to go to war in order to maintain smuggling and that smuggling consisting in the introduction of a demoralizing drug which the government of China wishes to keep out and which we for the lucre of gain want to introduce by force; and in this quarrel are going to burn and slay in the pride of our supposed superiority  Thomas Arnold to W W Hull March 18 1840 http://wwwvictorianweborg/history/empire/opiumwars/opiumwars1html 3 https://webarchiveorg/web/20180311121505/https://sacuorg/opium2html See also Opium in China In 1997 the colony of Hong Kong was returned to China Hong Kong Island became a British possession as a direct result of the Opium War the opening shots of which were fired 150 years ago All Chinese regardless of political ideology have condemned this armed confrontation as an unjust and immoral contest As far as they are concerned Britians waging a war for the sake of selling a poisonous drug constitutes the most shameful leaf of human history In the hindsight provided by subsequent events in China it is perhaps easy to condemn this act of British aggression but it is less certain that the event was seen in the same condemnatory light by Chinese and foreign observers a century and a half ago 4 Article on opium trade in 1920s Shanghai http://streetsofshanghaipbworkscom/w/page/18638691/Opium Opium (yapian ) Shanghai was built on the opium trade Before the 1850s Shanghai was the terminal port for coastal opium traffic Shanghai was opened to foreign trade on November 11th 1843 and very soon afterwards Jardines (the biggest British company in China at the time) set up a branch there and hired Chinese compradors one of whom was solely concerned with the supervision of opium By 1845 the opium moving through Shanghai constituted almost half of all the opium imported into China In 1880 nearly 13000000 pounds of opium came into China mainly from India By 1900 imports declined because China was now producing an average of 45000000 pounds of opium per annum itself There were at least 15000000 Chinese opium addicts  in Chengdu there was one opium den for every 67 inhabitants of the city In Shanghai some foreign missionaries began to complain that their homes were almost entirely surrounded by opium dens behind bamboo fences The city had more than eighty shops where the drug was sold openly in its crude form and there were over 1500 opium housesThe owners of these establishments bought their supplies from three major opium firms in the International Settlement  the Zhengxia Guoyu and Liwei All three were owned by Swatow (Chaozhou) merchants who formed a consortium This consortium obtained its opium from four foreign merchant houses: David Sassoon & Co ED Sassoon SJ David and Edward Ezra 5 Opium financed British rule in India http://newsbbccouk/2/hi/south\_asia/7460682stm What did you discover in the course of your research? How big was the trade? Opium steadily accounted for about 17-20% of Indian revenues If you think in those terms \[the fact that\] one single commodity accounted for such an enormous part of your economy is unbelievable extraordinary How and when did opium exports out of India to China begin? The idea of exporting opium to China started with Warren Hastings (the first governor general of British India) in 1780 The situation was eerily similar to \[what is happening\] today There was a huge balance of payments problem in relation to China China was exporting enormous amounts but wasnt interested in importing any European goods That was when Hastings came up with idea that the only way of balancing trade was to export opium to China,shylock92008,16270047200,2
h67hnxn,opbmcz,IS ANYONE APOLOGIZING TO GARY WEBB? by Michael Levine (DEA-RET) Gary Webb just in case youve already forgotten him was the journalist who in a well researched understated article entitled "The Dark Alliance" linked the CIA supported Contras to cocaine and weapons being sold to a California street gang and ended up literally being hounded out of journalism by every mainstream news peddling organization in the Yellow Pages Even his own employer The San Jose Mercury piled on for the kill And guess what? The CIA finally admitted yesterday in the New York Times no less that they in fact did "work with" the Nicaraguan Contras while they had information that they were involved in cocaine trafficking to the United States An action known to us court qualified experts and federal agents as Conspiracy to Import and Distribute Cocainea federal felony punishable by up to life in prison To illustrate how us regular walking around non CIA types are treated when we violate this law while I was serving as a DEA supervisor in New York City I put two New York City police officers in a federal prison for Conspiracy to distribute Cocaine when they looked the other way at their friends drug dealing We could not prove they earned a nickel nor that they helped their friend in any way they merely did not do their duty by reporting him They were sentenced to 10 and 12 years respectively and one of them I was recently told had committed suicide I have spent three decades as a court qualified expert and federal agent and am not aware of any class of American Citizen having special permission to violate the law that we have been taxed over $1 trillion in the past two decades to enforce; the law that every politician bureaucrat and media pundit keeps telling us protects us against the most serious danger to American security in our historyThe interesting thing to me about the Webb article is that the CIA is provably (and now admittedly) responsible for much larger scale drug trafficking than Webb alleged or even imagined in his report In fact according to a confidential DEA report entitled "Operation Hun a Chronology" that I used as part of the proof to back up the undercover experiences detailed in my book The Big White Lie (optioned for a movie by Robert Greenwald Productions) the CIA was actively blocking DEA from indicting many members of the ruling government of Bolivia from 1980-83during a time period that these same people were responsible for producing more than 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States As CIA Inspector General Hitz himself stated before congress it was during this time period that Nicaraguan Contra supporters were buying large amounts of cocaine from these same CIA protected Bolivians Do you think Congress wants to see this proof? The gang that cant spy straight as they are known to my listeners and about whom President Lyndon Johnson once said "When Rich folks dont trust their sons with the family money they send them on down to the CIA" certainly did a lot more damage to this nation than for example computer company owner Will Foster who was sentenced to 93 years in prison for possession of 70 marijuana plants for medicinal use Of course true to their shifty sleazy form while admitting that they did aid and abet Contra drug trafficking they are now refusing to release their own final investigative report which details the damning proof The same report that CIA Inspector General Fredrick Hitz during February 1998 had promised congress and the American people was forthcoming "shortly" because as CIA Director George Tenet now claims CIA does not have enough money in its budget to properly classify it You believe that then I know an old guy with a beard named Fidel wandering the streets of South Miami with an Island about 90 miles off the coast for sale He says the money is for his retirement How you ask do they get away with it? Well for one thing mainstream media the so-called Fourth Estate does all it can to help During the Iran-contra hearings when Senators Kerry and Damato were making pronouncements before the Senate indicating that the CIA was involved with drug trafficking Katherine Graham the owner of The Washington Post addressed a class of CIA recruits at CIAs Langley headquarters in November 1988 by saying: "There are some things the general public does not need to know and shouldnt I believe democracy flourishes when the government can take legitimate steps to keep its secrets and when the press can decide whether to print what it knows" Apparently CIA protection of drug trafficking was among those secrets Thus it should have been no surprise to those CIA agent recruits when Washington Post reporter and drug expert Michael Itsikoff wrote that there was "no credible evidence" linking the CIA supported contras to cocaine trafficking at the same time very credible evidence was being heard by Senator Kerrys committee indicating that the Contras may have been the top purveyors of drugs to Americans in our historyNeither should it have been a surprise to anyone who heard her statement when mainstream media refused to print the news that Oliver North US Ambassador to Costa Rica Lewis Tambs and various top level CIA officers were banned from ever entering Costa Rica by Nobel Prize winning President Oscar Arias for drug running The drugs by the way all going to us Nor should it have been a surprise when Gary Webb was destroyed by mainstream media for doing nothing more or less than telling the truth as he found it And now while CIA admits their felonies to the press but refuses to release the proof and Janet Reno the head of the Obstruction of Justice Department has done the unprecedented by classifying her own departments investigation into CIA drug trafficking the partnership for a Drug Free America is spending $2 billion of our tax money on already-proven-fruitless anti-drug ads And where do you think the money goes? Answer: to every major media corporation on the big board Gary Webb my friend you are owed a huge apology But I doubt that youll get it Not in this lifetime,shylock92008,16270105150,2

I t is now clear that this agreement began with the events described in THE BIG WHITE LIE; that the top drug traffickers in Bolivia then supplying virtually all the worlds cocaine-including Sonia Atala-were CIA assets that had to be protected from our deep cover probe Laura and I still have the proof of this that we used to back up the publication THE BIG WHITE LIE The same proof was later incorporated into other data backing up the publications of DEEP COVER and TRIANGLE OF DEATH [https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/](https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/) Our evidence-which congress has been craning its neck not to see- for instance shows clearly that during Operation Hun (the story in The Big White Lie) secret meetings were held with CIA and Justice Department wherein all indictments of top government officials in Bolivia were blocked We now believe this agreement began because of Operation Hun CIA had to hide the fact that they were supporting the people manufacturing virtually all the cocaine being produced in the world at that time In Deep Cover we showed that during Operation Trifecta-a highly successful deep cover probe into the top of the drug world in three countries (Panama Bolivia and Mexico) -Attorney General of the US Ed Meese found it necessary to warn the Attorney General of Mexico about DEAs case We (undercover DEA agents and Customs agents) found links between top US government officials and the people who murdered DEA agent Kiki Camarena that to this day go unexamined by our congress or anyone else In "TRIANGLE OF DEATH a work of "faction" we showed CIAs real-life involvement in the protection and creation of one of the most murderous criminal organizations to ever plague America an organization created by escaped Nazi fugitives under CIA protection-events occurring long before this alleged CIA Justice agreement And so the dance continues If anyone watched the CNN show you cannot have helped but notice the snickering on the part of Congressional chairman Porter Goss (an ex CIA officer) as congresswoman Maxine Waters spoke Now heres the reason why: Sources of mine who speak to me from inside this veil of secrecy out of conscience and because I am cheaper and more reliable than a psychiatrist have already told me the following: There is secret communication between CIA and members of the Congressional staff-one must keep in mind that Porter Goss the chairman is an ex CIA official- indicating that the whole hearing is just a smoke and mirror show so that the American people-particularly the Black community- can "blow off some steam" without doing any damage to CIA The CIA has been assured that nothing real will be done other than some embarrassing questions being asked That the hearings will result in the CIA receiving even a larger budget than the current $26 billion that they admit to One of the most distressing things for me a 25 year veteran of this business to listen to was when Congresswoman Waters said that the hearings were not about CIA officers being indicted and going to jail "That is not going to happen" she said Almost in the same breath she spoke of a recent case in Miami wherein a Venezuelan National Guard general was caught by Customs agents smuggling more than a ton of cocaine into the US Despite named CIA officers being involved in the plot as Congresswoman Waters stated the Justice Department will not tell her anything about the case because of "secrecy laws" No wonder chairman Goss was snickering She could not have played more neatly into CIA hands than to surrender before the battle was engaged For the entire existence of CIA they have gotten away with doing more damage to the American people than all our traditional enemies combined precisely because no one was ever prosecuted From the CIA protection of Nazi criminals from war crimes prosecution as they set up criminal organizations that preyed on America (Triangle of Death) to their lies to President Kennedy that dragged us into Bay of Pigs to their lies to President Johnson that dragged us into the Vietnam War to their creation of a pan Arab army of American hating drug trafficking terrorists during the Afghan War to the Church Commission hearings to MK-Ultra to the Bolivian Cocaine Coup ("The Big White Lie") to their protection of the worlds top cocaine traffickers as they laid waste to American streets (Deep cover) the CIA has acted exactly as Senator Frank Church once described them: "a runaway rogue elephantcompletely unresponsive to Congressthey (the CIA) have not only been unproductive they have been contra productive they have brought great shame on America" And the dance continues &#x200B;

The old lady gave him an eerie look and responded: "Plague is my name and it is my turn visiting your city" "How many will you take with you this time?" asked the priest "Few only one thousand" the plague responded After a week( and meanwhile having informed for the situation in his city) the priest was returning and in the entrance of the city he encountered the plague that was leaving "You lied to me" he said " You told me that you will take with you one thousand and yet you killed five thousand" And she responded: " I didnt lie I only took one thousand The rest were killed by stress and fear",supernatural1789,16414219620,2

Indian govt is busy with PR exercises while thousands are dying each day Largest state in India which is rule by ultra nationalist govt is arresting journalists for sharing videos and images They literally said they will seize property of people who spread rumors when in practice they jail whoever criticize them If you really care about bringing out the truth which is the point of researching conspiracies maybe try to find out what Indians are sufferings bcos of their govt who is more than happy to hide the bodies than save lives Spread that knowledge maybe it will help But stop posting this complete non sense PS: I apologize if my post seems rude Have been offering condolences every other day for past couple of weeks so I am a little emotional,Ballu111,16195524640,26

Run my name He was going to drive off so i said fuck it and let him run it Finally he goes to talk to the dude puts him in handcuffs after 15 minutes the guy talked himself out of handcuffs and drove off with all of my property for the second time 3) was being harassed and terrorized by drunk asshole neighbor for months once He was putting warrants on me for things that never happened tried to plant a needle in my yard then called the cops and said look hes been shooting up drugs! etc All kinds of crazy shit Yet when i try to to explain they put me in handcuffs for an hour for no reason and continue to let the dude harass me until i moved Mind you I am a 99% law abiding citizen The police simply dont help poor people which I was for most of my life,MeetingAromatic6359,16481841020,118

Only if youre vaccinated though If not no extra freedoms for you New South Wales will be removing restrictions soon but again only for the vaccinated The unvaccinated will still have extremely harsh restrictions So yes things in Australia are definitely bad So many people are just used to it now and have accepted it,Exciting-Designer-60,16313783980,1083
