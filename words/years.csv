ho28zkv,rdg5q3,I guess no one read the article; it makes a great point The problem is the child sex trafficking conspiracies are all fake Its worse than that Theyre blatant misinformation designed to win elections They say only Democrats are pedophiles yet we keep seeing the conservatives are often the ones getting caught with the children Theres pedophiles on both sides unfortunately These people even said Ruth Bader Ginsberg was a pedo when she was like 116 years old If you cant see though this as a blatant marketing campaign idk what to tell you other than you may need to work on your critical thinking Of course Ghislaine Maxwell and Epstein did fucked up shit That doesnt mean the world is ran by a bunch of Democrats who all have sex with kids and inject adrenochrome Its almost as if the people pointing their fingers are trying to get the heat off them Classic projection The GOP assumes that since they like to fuck little kids that everyone else is doing it too,jeremicci,16391849840,4
ho16sji,rdg5q3,So here is my take Ive been reading about satanic sex cults and Pizzagate for about 5 years But Ive really never been given any hard evidence that it all exists What I have found is that the Religious right is very obsessed with grouping sex workers and pornography with "sex trafficking of minors" into the same group this makes it a LOT easier to condemn all 3 and harder to fight against legislation that limits say strip clubs Because if a strip club is a possible "sex ring" then we cant be opposed to THAT right? My conspiracy theory is that the religious nazis are using sex trafficking as a front to go after sex workers and pornography thoughts?,wellmaybe24,16391689150,1
ho2utmd,rdg5q3,What I dont get about these sex trafficking stories is that they usually involve very rich men About 10 years ago I knew a Jewish guy in LA that was very rich He was a perv but he got much better women than Jeffrey He would just put ads on Craigslist for people that wanted a sugar daddy He got thousands of replies from all types of hot people From those he picked the hottest He consistently had very hot fwbs When he got tired of one hed get a new one The participants were all willing They loved the sugar Everything was legal I dont get why these rich guys dont just do that Why sex traffic when you can find hotter people by just being a sugar daddy? Even if they like the underage look They just look for women that are 18 but look underage Everytime I see one of jeffrey epsteins girls I wonder why hed sex traffic THAT They are not even that hot If all he wanted was sex orgies with super hot women all he needed to do was to supply sugar My friend got much hotter women from his Craigslist ads,Twiottle,16391950700,-1

he wrote a White House official that he was in favor of a "National Endowment in support of free institutions throughout the world" >The NED was initially placed under the auspices of the National Security Council and one Walter Raymond Jr a CIA propaganda expert who according to the late Robert Parry for years acted as liaison between the program and Casey Raymond also drew charming doodles like this depicting himself as a literal puppeteer controlling many different strings >The organization was stacked with prominent neoconservatives like Lane Kirkland John Richardson and Allen Weinstein Carl Gershman a longtime professional anticommunist was its first and so far only president One of its current board members Elliott Abrams is a war criminal with a history of subverting democracy overseas >To prevent the odor of US imperialism from contaminating the NEDs work the Reagan administration made it a private organization that in turn funded several more private institutions including the NDI and IRI But the fact that it was routinely staffed with former US officials and got its funding from the US government has always made this a dubious conceit >Equally dubious was the idea that its task was simply to promote democracy Two of its "core grantees"  which receive around 70 percent of its funding  are explicitly right wing: the IRI which is a GOP-led institution that once described its goals as advancing "democracy the rule of law and free-market economics"; and the Center for International Private Enterprise a project of the **US Chamber of Commerce** Even the Solidarity Center (formerly the Free Trade Union Institute) which is affiliated with the **AFL-CIO** went on to support conservative causes Only the NDI the Democrats arm could be said to be anywhere left of center Overall the NEDs track record tilts decidedly to the right CIPE and The Solidarity Center are two of the four grantees of the [NED](https://wwwsolidaritycenterorg/national-endowment-for-democracy-ned-ndi-iri-cipe-and-solidarity-center-welcome-increased-funding-from-congress/) NED does what the CIA used to do behind closed doors I thought the NED was pretty interesting considering Time Magazines story about the secret shadow campaign to save the [2020 election](https://timecom/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/) The article mentions multiple times how the group was working to protect and save Democracy (democracy is used ~33 times in the article) The article also outlines an alliance that included the AFL-CIO and the US Chamber of Commerce: >The pact was formalized in a terse little-noticed joint statement of the US Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO published on Election Day This article from [socialismcom](https://socialismcom/fs-article/betrayal-from-venezuela-to-iraq-the-afl-cio-and-the-national-endowment-for-democracy/) discusses how NED is a CIA front is funded by the US government and works closely with the leaders of the AFL-CIO: >A little-known far-right organization with a warm and fuzzy name the National Endowment for Democracy is up to no good in at least 40 countries That is bad enough especially given that the money for NEDs dirty deeds comes from working taxpayers courtesy of the US Congress Truly appalling however is the role that leaders of the AFL-CIO the largest US labor federation play in carrying out the work of this agency > A CIA front is born During the late 1970s the CIA was exposed for its active sabotage of numerous governments and progressive labor movements abroad Not so publicized was the AFL-CIOs role in aiding the CIA >Operating through the American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD) the AFL-CIO aided the overthrow of democratically elected governments in Guyana in 1963 Brazil in 1964 the Dominican Republic in 1965 and Chile in 1973 These are just a few examples of labor officialdoms shameful record in helping to carry out corporate-propelled US foreign policy >In 1983 after the CIA was widely discredited Ronald Reagans administration created a new agency the NED to take care of old business As an NED founder Allen Weinstein put it in 1991: "A lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA" >In his hard-hitting book Rogue State: A Guide to the Worlds Only Superpower William Blum describes some of the agencys activities "NED successfully manipulated elections in Nicaragua in 1990 and Mongolia in 1996 helped to overthrow democratically elected governments in Bulgaria in 1990 and Albania in 1991 and 1992 and was busy working in Haiti in the late 1990s on behalf of rightwing groups **NED like the CIA before it calls what it does supporting democracy** The governments and movements whom the NED targets call it destabilization" From the [Time 2020 election story:](https://timecom/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/) >"The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation" says Norm Eisen >The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation >The system didnt work magically Democracy is not self-executing" >And they believe the public needs to understand the systems fragility in order to ensure that democracy in America endures,Settlemente,16187557890,1

Barrs father wrote a sci-fi book about alien politicsgeo-political allegory that according to SNOPES "matter of factly" deals with the rape of young slaves https://wwwsnopescom/fact-check/bill-barr-jeffrey-epstein-book/ Heres an AP story where Barr calls the Epstein suicide "a perfect storm of screw-ups" and details some of the investigation (odd stick that he would use phrasing similarly to Q) https://wwwnbcnewscom/news/us-news/barr-calls-jeffrey-epstein-s-death-perfect-storm-screw-ups-n1089451 Bill Barr interviewed JEs last cellmate https://wwwbizpacreviewcom/2021/01/05/ag-bill-barr-personally-questioned-last-cellmate-of-jeffrey-epstein-before-alleged-suicide-source-says-1012813/ Bill Barr really wants us/US to believe Jeffrey killed himself And had some weird connections to JE And upon further timeline investigations seems to live and breathe DC https://videofoxnewscom/v/6031965836001#sp=show-clips Started in 73 with the CIA Almost 50 years later and this the dude that ruled it a "suicide",GlamSpell,16206584870,95

gxlsebc,n908zu,Ya I was on my honeymoon in greece(how I miss traveling) and my wife was like "hey that guy you always talk about killed himself" Reading the Epstein story is one big way to peer into what an intelligence agency asset is capable of doing Get jobs for no reason Get billions of dollars from no where Gather blackmail on politicians educators and corporations Be allowed to run the operation globally unchecked for 20+ years Then when the op is over your president who you have blackmail over arrest you and obviously fakes your death As soon as this massive blackmail operation ends the new phase of the agenda begins as a "pandemic" I wonder what his real name is and how many medals/awards he received for his commitment to a 20+ year long undercover operation Thats some serious dedication to a cause,ironlioncan,16206529220,9

Or anyone else since this was a criminal network Way too many people knew what was going on for so few to be held accountable The Clintons and Gates know they can always downplay accusations as conspiracy theory nonsense because no one will even investigate them which is pretty crazy when you consider the fact that we actually did haul him into a courtroom before over a stained dress Underage girls being trafficked in order to gain compromising evidence over politicians and other powerful people? Shit should be the permastory that Trump-Russia was for years being constantly covered and dug into (Funny that theres not an endless supply of secret govt sources giving the media juicy bits huh?)

hiaj2ss,qh1mh5,Amphetamine  Methamphetamine That methyl group makes your body metabolize it a whole lot differently and up its neurotoxic and addictive potential Although there literally is prescription methamphetamine (Desoxyn) its rarely prescribed Ive been on Adderall since I was 21 and it changed my life Ive been on and off it for years at a time due to insurance problems and I know when Im on it I am a better functioning human I have no idea on how I feel about children taking it Im kind of happy I started later in life,Yung-Fern,16353660730,1
hid9v3j,qh1mh5,I believe adderall has many benefits taken as prescribed for those who have ADHD I was the Ritalin generation which was prescribed to me It had its pros and cons My attention span increased and my grades were exponentially better Yet the side effects loss of appetite irritability cold sweats and depression were the reasons I stopped taking it I never did get prescribed adderall yet my boyfriend has been on it for several years He is 59 years old and takes it as prescribed with no ill side effects I have taken it before and I think its hugely helpful in focus I also think it has the ability to open parts of the mind for a person to see things in life they may never have seen because of all the distractions Its not surprising that the diagnosis rate from ADD has become so prevalent The world is full of things that are meant to distract Apps on cellphones and video games are purposefully filled with content that triggers the addiction part of the brain The creators are trying to get you hooked So I believe adderall is far less detrimental and may be beneficial at stopping the triggering effect of all the other manufactured distractions One more thing I want to say about ADD This condition is actually an asset As I have gotten older and learned behavior management I have good multi tasking skills can think outside the box and when I find something of interest I become hyperfocused and will not relent until I figure it out or finish People diagnosis with ADD are some of the most creative and forward thinking people I know,katiekat122,16354207410,1

i0zezv3,tg0kom,I posted this almost a year ago and have kept copying and pasting it because a lot of it has come true since then Ill warn you its long though This is a copy from another post but lines up the events of history that are being copied right now And why so many *Financial Issues* are being disguised (such as climate issues or pandemic issues) But a lot of this has happened before and is being full-on copied from other time periods and how even blackrock (the single largest hedge fund and called "The Fourth Branch of the US Government by Forbes and Bloomberg) [wrote the entire financial blueprint of what was going to happen before covid even started back in August 2019](https://wwwblackrockcom/corporate/literature/whitepaper/bii-macro-perspectives-august-2019pdf) Were seeing a complete system change why we needed to pump out a ton of money (literally 40% of all Dollars in existence were created in the last year) and why we need a WORLDWIDE unique Identification system tied to single individuals and a unique ID (a passport that is financial in its requirement but right now is being pushed through medical global requirements) Corona is a financial issue disguised as a pandemic issue because it can circumvent local laws and force the wordlwide laws Climate change is a financial issue being disguised as an ecosystem issue because again those laws are "bigger" than local laws and can circumvent normal procedures ----- We know "follow the money" to be the oldest and truest sense of deducing whats going on One of the things that stands out is that this event is following exactly the same events of the 20s and 70s Both times marked by huge inflation both times marked by a currency change and a new system and both times marked by a war that took place to get rid of the old system and expand the system while countries are hit hard by inflation But they all follow the same play ook = a massive amount of money was printed out and a certain assets price was then crashed that people were holding onto In the 20s-30s the asset was gold (whos price skyrocketed as money was printed and then crashed right before a market crash) and now with crypto currency (bitcoin was $7200 in january 2020 and got up to $60000 before crashing down to $32000 and flying back up to $65000 again and will probably crash even further once again before the final drop before it raises to crazy levels in ten years) In the case of gold the conspiracy is that two men formed a group and tried to corner the market and then the US released all its gold shares to crash that market and everyone sold their gold the US then used that price to buy gold from people and then backed the dollar with gold and even made owning it illegal alsoone of those two men who tried cornering the market was the Presidents brother in law so it was clearly a setup and a lot of people lost money but the US gained a lot of gold at cheaper prices right before switching the currency to be backed by gold So it was all about currency So why is the same thing happening again? August was the 50th year anniversary of Nixon ending the gold backed dollar in the 70s and starting the petro backed dollar So what does the end of the currency look like? Remember I said there was a crash for gold because the US released all its stores and crashed the market? Well guess [who owns the most bitcoin](https://wwwwiredcom/2013/12/fbi-wallet/)? Well for starters everyone will need a personal wallet (hence a vaccine passport for tracking is going to come sooner or later but this is the best excuse) The current chair of the SEC (Gary Gensler) who was installed in April taught a class about crypto currency at MIT Sloane (which is an enlightening resource if you want to see how officials view crypto currencies) He even talks about bitcoin finishing a 10 year testing phase and how it survived {what does that even mean? I thought Satoshi Nakamoto was an anonymous person I thought crypto was all about a decentralized financial platform and yet the current head of the SEC says it survived a testing phase?} So what else do we know signifies the end of the petro dollar? Weve all seen how much climate change pops up Well plastics are part of the oil system and thats part of the end too is my guess I know people think its an environmental factor for climate change but we all know that the biggest changes arent happening (a very tiny percentage accounts for the most pollutants but nothing is done about those) But following the money its clear that climate change is a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue This is extremely clear because two separate Senate and house committees met with banks in May about climate changewhy would they meet with banks instead of oil companies or manufacturers? Again the evidence points to a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue But theyre pushing us simply to change what system we consume while avoiding the largest climate change pollutants And even ending the oil system next is energy sourcingwell enter in Afghanistan popping up again and the Taliban/ISIS (which is where the largest lithium deposit is) But the key point is that we will move off of seaparate working grids (because even if you steal gasoline it still works on your vehicle) onto one grid that uses unique identification (which electrical vehicles already do but again is part of the movement away from the machine driven system and into the computer/tracking system) And what about the old infrastructure? Have you noticed how all those hacking attacks kept happening to old infrastructure key points? And the hackers keep asking other countries for huge amount of bitcoin? Have you noticed how war keeps popping up involving all those countries on the old system? Must be a complete coincidence Im sure But well know for sure this is the case if the market crashes soon Hyperinflation is close and technically happening but the FED refuses to acknowledge it (crazy how we dont vote for the FED president and yet they control the entire economy) Weve now had the largest 12 month increase in inflation since 1983 The CPI has changed over and over how inflation is measured true inflation is estimated anywhere from 13% - 25% (but you already know that and likely got your rent hiked already up 20% year-over-year) Thats what happened in the 30s right as they switched to a new backing for the dollar (with Gold) and were seeing all the signs present now that this is true If were about to end the machine driven age and start the computer driven stage then we would each need a unique wallet address and a passport can accompany that It would be the easiest way to install worldwide tracking (since crypto provides a ledger for everything) Also well know bitcoin prices will shoot through the roof after a crash if all this is true and happens Either way this ties corona (an excuse for mass printing of money) the vaccine (more money and a unique wallet tied to ID) end of petro dollar and machine age (climate change is a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue end of plastics from oil) end of the retail to stores system and move to full digital marketplace the beginning of the crypto dollar and crashing the crypto markets (already happened but still can drop much farther along with the rest of the market similar to exact same scenarios in the past) Were entering into the most tracked age of all time everything on the planet will be tracked back to unique ids and monitored on a blockchain/verified by a computer "The Great Reset" might sound like a conspiracy meme but thats an awful lot of coordination to happen in a short period of time Even better since I wrote this the IMF and 10 countries got together in Israel and [Simulated a Cyber Attack that would shut down the Global Financial System](https://financeyahoocom/news/exclusive-imf-10-countries-simulate-133015124html) Im sure thats just a coincidence too! Im sure once it happens everyone will be shocked and demand answersthat they already have Its coming my guess is at the start of Bidens second term since thats when they did it with Nixon Ill keep writing this and if Im wrong I will stop but weve been checking off each point from that paper by Blackrock ever since corona started Every company put money back into their company and was given a massive amount with the PPP loans and every country matched financial and monetary policies and was given massive amounts of money during corona Soif the market started showing signs of a massive failure in 2019 and this paper was put out in August 2019 and weve followed every item line by line of this outline since then and it came before coronathen what does that say about corona This was the single largest robbery in history and unless you are in the 1% then you are going to be the one paying for it You paid for it not just with two full years of your life hearing about this you didnt just pay by having communities torn apart or having to hear people argue about things that arent the actual problem you didnt just pay for it by having to actually stay in solitary confinement that includes the ability to watch your phone and the internetyou literally are going to actually pay for the rest of your life with the inflation costs and debt Well see if this is rightbut weve already checked off most the points from that paper The rich got so insanely rich since this happened It was literally the best year for Wall Street but how was it for most people?,garthsworld,16474938020,2

h9a3aa2,p5wmdj,Its not the fault of any one person As a country over 70% of us wanted to invade Afghanistan after 9/11 I was one of those people Until 2009 over 70% of us thought we should stay There are legitimate criticisms that can be leveled at Trump Biden Obama and Bush but it should not stop there We sent 2 trillion dollars of our money over there thousands of lives and altered life for countless American families But it all collapsed in 10 days No matter how bad the president is he isnt bad enough to be responsible for ineptitude on such a massive scale We knew there was a massive problem when we first began to train their soldiers International Security Assistance Force or better known as ISAF is where the major problem lies For one our military personnel quickly gave ISAF a new moniker "I suck at fighting" The majority of the recruits that joined the Afghan military were extremely poor recruits Take a look at this video of our troops training Afghans to do jumping jacks https://youtube/QdggP7rw0mg To be fair there were exceptions to this rule and some Afghans turned out to be great fighters The problem however is that they were few and far between The next issue is that all of this was thought up by a group of bureaucrats who played it like they would in any Western country To give ISAF "credibility" they sought out local "authorities" to sign on Those authorities were the mujiahdeen warlords These are the same warlords that started the Afghan civil war in the 90s So these warlords used ISAF as a piggy bank for the next 20 years Providing token compliance but nothing more This is all to say that our plans should have changed years ago We tried one strategy and it sucked but we couldnt admit we were wrong so we just kept pumping resources into it Im short Afghanistan is the sunk cost fallacy on a monumental scale Anyone responsible for propping this plan up are the real ones we need to blame Yes our presidents are in that group but they are far from the only ones,rhm54,16292019550,2

hv1n1ts,sh2zq9,Back in my day the "banned books" were the books on the school reading list and teachers would just refer to them as such so the kids would think they were edgy We even had "banned book week" and were all supposed to read To Kill a Mockingbird or something else that was controversial in the South 70 years ago I always thought that if a kid brought in The Turner Diaries or something by David Irving then the teachers would shit themselves,SnooStrawberries9414,16436634370,6

gw6iow2,n0evko,I dont give 2 shits about what a president says they aALL lie I care about what he does Trump presided over the greatest economy this country has ever known He had the lowest unemployment numbers across the board for every demographic except white men There were at least 4-7 million people that came off of welfare during his tenure He signed a tax cut that benefitted over 90% of the population that actually pays taxes He had illegal immigration to a trickle He had China on its heels and finally paying their share on imports and exports North Korea wasnt testing bombs Iran wasnt talking shit Put programs in place like operation warp speed to get a vaccine developed and to the public in less than a year which is unheard of And much more And were talking about a guy with 0 years of politics In comparison Biden who has been in politics for well over 40 years and what has he done besides grope kids in front of their fucking parents and smell womens hair oh and pretty much coerce Ukraine into firing a prosecutor that was investigating his fucking pedophile crackhead sons employment in an industry he had no knowledge of in a country he knows nothing about And dont forget to give "the big guy" his cutya know ;-) And theres people out there that really think that senile old fuck got 80 million votes,LordClaranceMcDonald,16196230910,1
hmgdleq,r45a5n,I remember when this was first discovered/posted on r/conspiracy back when she was arrested in 2020 and the account suddenly went dark It was fascinating to watch it come together in real time This information had better be a part of the prosecutions case in the trial Ill tell you why Im 99% sure personally that /u/maxwellhill was Lady Ghislaine herself I also am about 75% sure Aaron Swartz unearthed EVERYTHING related to Jeffrey&Ghislaine/Intelligence Agencies/human trafficking/political blackmail/Moloch when he hacked the MIT research lab which Jeffrey was a prominent associate of Aaron hacked the private servers there and found something he was NOT supposed to find and was soon charged with such extreme punishments by the court system which led to his suicide (I have no reason to think he was assassinated but of course it wouldnt surprise me Look up [the relationship between Courtney Love and her father/The Grateful Dead/CIA/MKUltra](https://covertactionmagazinecom/2021/07/21/u-s-intelligence-coverup-newly-declassified-fbi-file-on-nirvanas-kurt-cobain-compounds-evidence-implicating-his-wifes-role-in-his-murder/) Kurt was likely assassinated by these forces for being a political thorn in their side to a much lesser degree than Aaron was becoming Smart skilled young men who competently buck the system are their worst nightmare and must be *crucified*) Aaron died in 2013 and /u/maxwellhill IIRC showed up as a high level account around 2012 The SOPA/PIPA protests spearheaded by Aaron and others in his circle were around 2012 and their success put Aaron on the elites map in a bad way Then when he found whatever he found hacking MIT he became a HUGE problem for their scheme Poor kid probably had no idea what to do with himself 26 years old and to discover all this by yourself and to live with it alone? Think of the emotional trauma we have all endured in the last years as all this has come out and weve had each other to get through it all Aaron had no one He was probably absolutely fucked in the head/heart by the time he died You know maybe I dont know 100% if any of this is true But it sure does add up Also the McGraw-Hill textbook company (the makers of all our K-12 school history textbooks) is owned by the Maxwell family So /u/maxwellhill controls the narrative just as McGraw-Hill does Its a cute pun Ill give her that,umbertostrange,16381375500,124

i0dfu6d,tcdedn,I understand your sentiment so much suffering on both sides But Ukraine was invaded that is the difference Sadly the Russian people will suffer also because their leader is and insane narcissist But at least the Russians can sleep in their own beds and give birth in a hospital or drive down the street without worrying about being bombed The Russian people will suffer economically for years to come becuase of the action of their government but most will survive as will their countrys infrastructure The Russian people dont have to run in fear from their homes leaving everything sometimes even pets behind as they seek some sort of safety The Russian people dont have to flee on foot to other countries hoping someone will take pity on them and provide warmth food and shelter as they leave their sons and husbands behind Imagine those pregnant women in the hospital or the tiny babies in the NICU being rushed through rubble to a basement where nurses desperately try to keep them safe and alive with bombs dropping around them That is real terror Ukraine is being invaded and leveled only because one man wants the land But you are right in that both Ukrainian and Russian people are suffering but it is not equal levels of suffering Its ok to feel empathy and sadness for both no one is making you "love" one side and "hate" the other You can stand with Ukraine AND hate what Putin is doing to his own people I personally feel such pain for the Russians who have no idea whats going on and are losing access to money food even stuff that gets them through the day like McDonalds and video games Its not fair to the citizens Sanctions like that are meant to squeeze the citizens who would then put pressure on the government which in this case does not care one bit what happens to the millions of people they are tasked with looking after Its horrible and unfair to the Russians but Ukraine is not the one doing these things to the Russians Ukraine is simply trying to survive right now I think we can all agree that Putin and his corrupt government are the bad guy here yes? TL:DR: Its ok to feel sad for the citizens of both countries but there is clearly one Country who is the aggressor and one being mercilessly attacked But the average Russian citizen is not to blame and its ok to have empathy for them as well,thisistherightname,16470964080,1

h6bceli,oq0kxg,For those that complain of capitalism or communism or what not the real issue is the kid raising system Lets pretend you want to be a millionaire by 30 In a college system with $100k of debt starting at 22 you basically need to earn around $150k per year after taxes and expenses to get to $1 Mil by 30 if investments go well etc (about doubling) Now remove college all together Instead of $150k you need like $90k Now imagine you take a kid and instead of the asinine question what do you want to do (all girls : animals community kids environment all boys : outdoor guy what my dad did) - and instead say what do you want to have This is what I do They always want a nice car vs shit car They want a happy spouse with kids vs alone and desperate They want to be able to afford medicines vs bothering family with a go fund me Its a relatively easy decision; lots of money better There are actually a LOT of careers that pay $90k without a degree Now if you plan for this you get them as an apprentice BUT ONLY for careers that pay $60k base and $200k tops like computers legal finance media & medical I had a dancing girlfriend that became a doctor simply by working at Walgreens She of course had no concept of what being a doctor was but after the pharmacist kept giving her money driving a nice car and invited her to her nice house - boom she became a doctor (internally) It was easy But more to the point I got this trailer kid that I sponsored over a few years who will be making $60k at 18 in computers - all I had to do was pay him $100 or so at a time for computer work here and there roughly what I would have paid someone else He *might* be a millionaire by 30 working full time in computers at 18 with what is normally referred to as the best resume theyve seen - and thats even when he slacked off (his dad gets him drunk weekly and his aunt keeps telling him to spend the next several years getting high and going to music shows thats what life is about!) - I did help him start his own business but he never did the professional networking meetings I suggested And the Key to all this? Benjamin Franklins Autobiography!!! Seriously!!! In it is a quick self study guide (13 virtues) to teach you to not be a dick Then there is the Junto system to make you network and listen to others and learn from them share with them in a constructive way And the final piece of the Benjamin Franklin system was to teach kids (nephews in his day) your skills when they were about 15 Then invest in them enough to start a shop (like $20K say) Then they pay you 50% of profits the next several years In Franklins system he went from poor as fuck to worker (18) - $30k (in todays money) - to extremely good worker living healthy connected and disciplined - shop manager (21) $60k - But the kicker at 32 he invested in 3 nephews basically This is where he made all his money Those nephews were also printers like him By 37 he was retired - and most of his inventions & political involvement happened after 37 (1740) And it was Franklin *the most* responsible for the AM Revolution cause he taught people how to make a fuck ton of money basically (and not to be assholes - EI self governing) Meh dribble but if you do something similar to what the Swiss do today where the average professional salary *is actually* $200000 then ALL of economics solves itself But they force kids into smart apprenticeship programs at 15 Thats the biggest difference The good kids are in professional clubs by 17 This is 100% normal Making $60k out of a Swiss high school is absolutely the norm and the reason the main reason they have such immense wealth Literally every nation could copy this approach and not take away from anyone else but we dont for whatever reason but you should do so with your kids always,Bitcoin1776,16270878610,1
h6azoh2,oq0kxg,No one takes out 200k at 17 most of the people taking out that much in student loans are in medical/pharmacy/veterinary school possibly Graduate programs And are therefore not 17 more like 22-23 at that point after bachelors Most of these people are making 100-200k a year after residency and can easily pay off their loan if they were disciplined and/or financially literate and is a great RoR on the money borrowed and will not have difficulty finding employment The people loaning know this A business loan is a lot more risky most small businesses go out of business is the sad reality Undergraduate loans are another beast but at the same time there is an element of personal responsibility to consider here You have the ability to choose where you go you dont have to pay 40k a year to go to a private college when you can go to a college that is just as good for 10k You can go to community college for the first 2 years and save tons of money You can live off campus and work to pay rent and food and gas you dont have to get a housing loan At the end of the day you have a lot of control over how much you choose to borrow you also have control over what major you study and understanding the job market and what businesses are looking for those skills how you can market in the job place So when people complain about their huge undergrad loans and cant find a job well Im not saying the system isnt broken but there is an element of personal responsibility objectivity and neutrality that I feel needs to be embedded into this discussion,MissionIll0,16270811450,-1

I really do not remember in any history of a war undertaken with such combined injustice and baseness Ordinary wars of conquest are to me far less wicked than to go to war in order to maintain smuggling and that smuggling consisting in the introduction of a demoralizing drug which the government of China wishes to keep out and which we for the lucre of gain want to introduce by force; and in this quarrel are going to burn and slay in the pride of our supposed superiority  Thomas Arnold to W W Hull March 18 1840 http://wwwvictorianweborg/history/empire/opiumwars/opiumwars1html 3 https://webarchiveorg/web/20180311121505/https://sacuorg/opium2html See also Opium in China In 1997 the colony of Hong Kong was returned to China Hong Kong Island became a British possession as a direct result of the Opium War the opening shots of which were fired 150 years ago All Chinese regardless of political ideology have condemned this armed confrontation as an unjust and immoral contest As far as they are concerned Britians waging a war for the sake of selling a poisonous drug constitutes the most shameful leaf of human history In the hindsight provided by subsequent events in China it is perhaps easy to condemn this act of British aggression but it is less certain that the event was seen in the same condemnatory light by Chinese and foreign observers a century and a half ago 4 Article on opium trade in 1920s Shanghai http://streetsofshanghaipbworkscom/w/page/18638691/Opium Opium (yapian ) Shanghai was built on the opium trade Before the 1850s Shanghai was the terminal port for coastal opium traffic Shanghai was opened to foreign trade on November 11th 1843 and very soon afterwards Jardines (the biggest British company in China at the time) set up a branch there and hired Chinese compradors one of whom was solely concerned with the supervision of opium By 1845 the opium moving through Shanghai constituted almost half of all the opium imported into China In 1880 nearly 13000000 pounds of opium came into China mainly from India By 1900 imports declined because China was now producing an average of 45000000 pounds of opium per annum itself There were at least 15000000 Chinese opium addicts  in Chengdu there was one opium den for every 67 inhabitants of the city In Shanghai some foreign missionaries began to complain that their homes were almost entirely surrounded by opium dens behind bamboo fences The city had more than eighty shops where the drug was sold openly in its crude form and there were over 1500 opium housesThe owners of these establishments bought their supplies from three major opium firms in the International Settlement  the Zhengxia Guoyu and Liwei All three were owned by Swatow (Chaozhou) merchants who formed a consortium This consortium obtained its opium from four foreign merchant houses: David Sassoon & Co ED Sassoon SJ David and Edward Ezra 5 Opium financed British rule in India http://newsbbccouk/2/hi/south\_asia/7460682stm What did you discover in the course of your research? How big was the trade? Opium steadily accounted for about 17-20% of Indian revenues If you think in those terms \[the fact that\] one single commodity accounted for such an enormous part of your economy is unbelievable extraordinary How and when did opium exports out of India to China begin? The idea of exporting opium to China started with Warren Hastings (the first governor general of British India) in 1780 The situation was eerily similar to \[what is happening\] today There was a huge balance of payments problem in relation to China China was exporting enormous amounts but wasnt interested in importing any European goods That was when Hastings came up with idea that the only way of balancing trade was to export opium to China,shylock92008,16270047200,2
h67hnxn,opbmcz,IS ANYONE APOLOGIZING TO GARY WEBB? by Michael Levine (DEA-RET) Gary Webb just in case youve already forgotten him was the journalist who in a well researched understated article entitled "The Dark Alliance" linked the CIA supported Contras to cocaine and weapons being sold to a California street gang and ended up literally being hounded out of journalism by every mainstream news peddling organization in the Yellow Pages Even his own employer The San Jose Mercury piled on for the kill And guess what? The CIA finally admitted yesterday in the New York Times no less that they in fact did "work with" the Nicaraguan Contras while they had information that they were involved in cocaine trafficking to the United States An action known to us court qualified experts and federal agents as Conspiracy to Import and Distribute Cocainea federal felony punishable by up to life in prison To illustrate how us regular walking around non CIA types are treated when we violate this law while I was serving as a DEA supervisor in New York City I put two New York City police officers in a federal prison for Conspiracy to distribute Cocaine when they looked the other way at their friends drug dealing We could not prove they earned a nickel nor that they helped their friend in any way they merely did not do their duty by reporting him They were sentenced to 10 and 12 years respectively and one of them I was recently told had committed suicide I have spent three decades as a court qualified expert and federal agent and am not aware of any class of American Citizen having special permission to violate the law that we have been taxed over $1 trillion in the past two decades to enforce; the law that every politician bureaucrat and media pundit keeps telling us protects us against the most serious danger to American security in our historyThe interesting thing to me about the Webb article is that the CIA is provably (and now admittedly) responsible for much larger scale drug trafficking than Webb alleged or even imagined in his report In fact according to a confidential DEA report entitled "Operation Hun a Chronology" that I used as part of the proof to back up the undercover experiences detailed in my book The Big White Lie (optioned for a movie by Robert Greenwald Productions) the CIA was actively blocking DEA from indicting many members of the ruling government of Bolivia from 1980-83during a time period that these same people were responsible for producing more than 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States As CIA Inspector General Hitz himself stated before congress it was during this time period that Nicaraguan Contra supporters were buying large amounts of cocaine from these same CIA protected Bolivians Do you think Congress wants to see this proof? The gang that cant spy straight as they are known to my listeners and about whom President Lyndon Johnson once said "When Rich folks dont trust their sons with the family money they send them on down to the CIA" certainly did a lot more damage to this nation than for example computer company owner Will Foster who was sentenced to 93 years in prison for possession of 70 marijuana plants for medicinal use Of course true to their shifty sleazy form while admitting that they did aid and abet Contra drug trafficking they are now refusing to release their own final investigative report which details the damning proof The same report that CIA Inspector General Fredrick Hitz during February 1998 had promised congress and the American people was forthcoming "shortly" because as CIA Director George Tenet now claims CIA does not have enough money in its budget to properly classify it You believe that then I know an old guy with a beard named Fidel wandering the streets of South Miami with an Island about 90 miles off the coast for sale He says the money is for his retirement How you ask do they get away with it? Well for one thing mainstream media the so-called Fourth Estate does all it can to help During the Iran-contra hearings when Senators Kerry and Damato were making pronouncements before the Senate indicating that the CIA was involved with drug trafficking Katherine Graham the owner of The Washington Post addressed a class of CIA recruits at CIAs Langley headquarters in November 1988 by saying: "There are some things the general public does not need to know and shouldnt I believe democracy flourishes when the government can take legitimate steps to keep its secrets and when the press can decide whether to print what it knows" Apparently CIA protection of drug trafficking was among those secrets Thus it should have been no surprise to those CIA agent recruits when Washington Post reporter and drug expert Michael Itsikoff wrote that there was "no credible evidence" linking the CIA supported contras to cocaine trafficking at the same time very credible evidence was being heard by Senator Kerrys committee indicating that the Contras may have been the top purveyors of drugs to Americans in our historyNeither should it have been a surprise to anyone who heard her statement when mainstream media refused to print the news that Oliver North US Ambassador to Costa Rica Lewis Tambs and various top level CIA officers were banned from ever entering Costa Rica by Nobel Prize winning President Oscar Arias for drug running The drugs by the way all going to us Nor should it have been a surprise when Gary Webb was destroyed by mainstream media for doing nothing more or less than telling the truth as he found it And now while CIA admits their felonies to the press but refuses to release the proof and Janet Reno the head of the Obstruction of Justice Department has done the unprecedented by classifying her own departments investigation into CIA drug trafficking the partnership for a Drug Free America is spending $2 billion of our tax money on already-proven-fruitless anti-drug ads And where do you think the money goes? Answer: to every major media corporation on the big board Gary Webb my friend you are owed a huge apology But I doubt that youll get it Not in this lifetime,shylock92008,16270105150,2

1975) CIA Chief in Laos Theodore Shackly was in the drug business having contacts with the Opium Warlord Lor Sing Han and his followers Santo Trafficante acted as his buying and transporting agent while Richard Armitage handled the financial section with the Banks in Australia Even after the Vietnam War ended when Richard Armitage was being posted to the US Embassy in Thailand his dealings in the drug business continued as before He was then acting as the US government official concerning with the drug problems in Southeast Asia After 1979 Richard Armitage resigned from the US Embassys posting and set up the "Far East Trading Company" as a front for his continuation in the drug trade and to bribe CIA agents in Laos and around the world Soon after Daniel Arnold was made to handle the drug business as well as the transportation of arms sales Jerry Daniels then took over the drug trade from Richard Armitage For over 10 years Armitage supported his men in Laos and Thailand with the profits from his drug trade and most of the cash were deposited with the Banks in Australia which was to be used in buying his way for quicker promotions to higher positions Within the month of July 1980 Thailands english newspaper "Bangkok Post" included a news report that CIA agents were using Australia as a transit-base for their drug business and the banks in Australia for depositing transferring the large sum of money involved Verifications of the news report can be made by the US Justice Department with Bangkok Post and in Australia Other facts given herewith have been drawn out from out Secret Reports files so as to present to you of the real facts as to why the drug problem is being prolonged till today 3 Finally we sincerely hope in the nearest future to be given the opportunity to actively take part in helping the US government the Americans and people of the world in eradication and uprooting the drug problems I remain Yours Respectively Khun Sa Vice Chairman Thailand Revolutionary Council (TRC),shylock92008,16270028910,1

I t is now clear that this agreement began with the events described in THE BIG WHITE LIE; that the top drug traffickers in Bolivia then supplying virtually all the worlds cocaine-including Sonia Atala-were CIA assets that had to be protected from our deep cover probe Laura and I still have the proof of this that we used to back up the publication THE BIG WHITE LIE The same proof was later incorporated into other data backing up the publications of DEEP COVER and TRIANGLE OF DEATH [https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/](https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/) Our evidence-which congress has been craning its neck not to see- for instance shows clearly that during Operation Hun (the story in The Big White Lie) secret meetings were held with CIA and Justice Department wherein all indictments of top government officials in Bolivia were blocked We now believe this agreement began because of Operation Hun CIA had to hide the fact that they were supporting the people manufacturing virtually all the cocaine being produced in the world at that time In Deep Cover we showed that during Operation Trifecta-a highly successful deep cover probe into the top of the drug world in three countries (Panama Bolivia and Mexico) -Attorney General of the US Ed Meese found it necessary to warn the Attorney General of Mexico about DEAs case We (undercover DEA agents and Customs agents) found links between top US government officials and the people who murdered DEA agent Kiki Camarena that to this day go unexamined by our congress or anyone else In "TRIANGLE OF DEATH a work of "faction" we showed CIAs real-life involvement in the protection and creation of one of the most murderous criminal organizations to ever plague America an organization created by escaped Nazi fugitives under CIA protection-events occurring long before this alleged CIA Justice agreement And so the dance continues If anyone watched the CNN show you cannot have helped but notice the snickering on the part of Congressional chairman Porter Goss (an ex CIA officer) as congresswoman Maxine Waters spoke Now heres the reason why: Sources of mine who speak to me from inside this veil of secrecy out of conscience and because I am cheaper and more reliable than a psychiatrist have already told me the following: There is secret communication between CIA and members of the Congressional staff-one must keep in mind that Porter Goss the chairman is an ex CIA official- indicating that the whole hearing is just a smoke and mirror show so that the American people-particularly the Black community- can "blow off some steam" without doing any damage to CIA The CIA has been assured that nothing real will be done other than some embarrassing questions being asked That the hearings will result in the CIA receiving even a larger budget than the current $26 billion that they admit to One of the most distressing things for me a 25 year veteran of this business to listen to was when Congresswoman Waters said that the hearings were not about CIA officers being indicted and going to jail "That is not going to happen" she said Almost in the same breath she spoke of a recent case in Miami wherein a Venezuelan National Guard general was caught by Customs agents smuggling more than a ton of cocaine into the US Despite named CIA officers being involved in the plot as Congresswoman Waters stated the Justice Department will not tell her anything about the case because of "secrecy laws" No wonder chairman Goss was snickering She could not have played more neatly into CIA hands than to surrender before the battle was engaged For the entire existence of CIA they have gotten away with doing more damage to the American people than all our traditional enemies combined precisely because no one was ever prosecuted From the CIA protection of Nazi criminals from war crimes prosecution as they set up criminal organizations that preyed on America (Triangle of Death) to their lies to President Kennedy that dragged us into Bay of Pigs to their lies to President Johnson that dragged us into the Vietnam War to their creation of a pan Arab army of American hating drug trafficking terrorists during the Afghan War to the Church Commission hearings to MK-Ultra to the Bolivian Cocaine Coup ("The Big White Lie") to their protection of the worlds top cocaine traffickers as they laid waste to American streets (Deep cover) the CIA has acted exactly as Senator Frank Church once described them: "a runaway rogue elephantcompletely unresponsive to Congressthey (the CIA) have not only been unproductive they have been contra productive they have brought great shame on America" And the dance continues &#x200B;

hrfghyd,rwkj3w,The worst is yet to come My religion (Orthodox) had prophecies about this and so far around 8-9 of them came true (theres more but they are some smaller ones so I wouldnt mention them) The one that is yet to come true is the one saying "once the humanity is at the point of not knowing what to do as times are getting worse and no solutions are to be found antichrist will appear with a solution" (I tried to translate it as best as I could) Vaccines are proving as failing which is exactly what they want The time will come when they will say publicly that they no longer know what to do and how to deal with the pandemic Thats when a *certain person* will appear with a "solution" to end all problems and he will be throned in UN as the humanitys saviour I made this as brief as I could as it is rather complex and in order to truly understand and believe all this youd need to know a lot of backstory Another huge one said that "there will be a global pandemic before the end" (This one was told about 200-300 years ago iirc) We live in the end times sadly You may or may not believe me but Ive been following advices that my religion told me due to these prophecies and I havent regretted a single decision I made thus far Ive simply been following prophecies and what they tell us to do and Im making it work Havent and wont take the vax as I know what it is leading towards,HRCK0,16414291920,2

Last month my husband lost his job of 10 years He had had been their model employee the golden boy so to speak Operating heavy equipment was just so natural for him and he had not ever Been written up or had one accident in the 10 years he was there Once when the company had been slacking and hadnt put rails on all the equipment my husband was blown off and landed directly on his neck breaking two vertebra He didnt even think of suing of seeking retribution he loved his job and it was good to us he said Well ultimately he was dismissed amidst a swarm of lawyers at the beginning of December The kids are seniors and we plan to leave Colorado after graduation for a more free state Still we have never thought even twice that getting the jab was even a option Everything concerning this vaccine has been unnatural since the beginning how did people not see this?  Hardship isnt over but we got this :) PS I couldnt say my whole family because my oldest that served in the Navy and is just in the reserves now was scared of the threats they gave and got vaccinated I cried and cried that day ,aliah358,16413881250,5

Now 1 month later they send her another threat and it is obvious that they didnt even READ her justification and are now only accepting an excuse directly from a doctor! They are also ONLY listing allergies to the vaccine as a medical excuse I know she is scared to death Ive heard her balling her eyes out asking her superiors at the company to speak up for her and advocate They are all too afraid to be viewed as "antivaxxer" themselves and have done nothing to help her so far Dont want to piss off daddy tech These superiors also had NO IDEA that this mandate was even in place at the company They knew nothing about these threats being sent to unvaccinated workers She is the top performer in her team This is the best job she has ever had by far and she is scared to death of losing it To the point where she is now thinking of getting the vaccine even though she knows it is highly risky for her health in particular! She has done everything right to justify not getting the vaccine and they are completely ignoring her! If anyone in the US knows of any recourse we could take against this measure please tell me! I know that this is illegal and the courts will MAYBE eventually side with basic fucking ethics but she cant wait for that At the end of this month she will be vaccinated or unemployed all so she can continue working from home around nobody else Again if anyone has advice please give itand keep in mind the company is stonewalling her and not even answering her questions,billyjk93,16414124040,1

h4x1ngf,oibtiu,I agree that you shouldnt be required to purchase anything for the right to vote However who doesnt have an ID in 2021? Seriously what can you do without an ID? You need an ID to get a job get healthcare (private insurance or Medicaid) get government assistance buy cigarettes or alcohol drive a car buy a car get a mortgage rent a house or apartment and the list goes on and on Before people start talking about poor rural people I live in rural MS and in my 45 years I honestly cant recall anyone who doesnt have an ID My grandmother never drove a car in her life and she had an ID I grew up in a very poor county that was predominantly black and I know some people who would slap the taste out of your mouth for even implying that they were too backward to get an ID So every time a politician gets up talking about how some people are too poor or too dumb to get an ID I instantly know that they have no idea what theyre talking about If that really is the case then heres a novel idea fund a nationwide campaign to make government-issued Ids free But you wont see them doing that or even suggesting it #nocommensenseinwashington,HighMaint,16260962850,1

It does feel like profiling honestly when my local shops make me show proof of vaccination At the end of the day Im okay with it because Im a pragmatist but regardless of the law I think people should have the right to be selfish And there are points to be made I always joke that Im on team coronavirus I think we need far fewer humans on earth and a virus is as judicial a process as any to weed out the unhealthy and strengthen our collective immunity The only reason we have strong immune systems today is because for billions of years we have been fighting this same battle,BenchPuzzleheaded670,16324246870,1

Absolutely not Viruses mutate we know this Alpha/Beta Delta and now Omnicron Theres almost certainly going to be another variant in the future - and while the odds are that it will be even less deadly - nothing is set in stone Just how Covid seemingly popped up out of nowhere ~2 years ago - a new kickass variant that makes you bleed from your eyeballs could almost appear out of thin air Dont say its over until its actually over,Eren_Schitt,16402043140,0

gzvqvfo,nniy3y,Ima set aside the stupidity of this and simply remind everyone that any mandate your employer wants to implement must be applied to uniformly to everyone for it to be legal &#x200B; For example if your company threatens to fire you for being unvaccinated; they must also fire every unvaccinated full time employee that has been working there for years (**employees whom the company has already invested allot of time and money in training**) If they cherry pick just you then that is discrimination &#x200B; In typical media fashion allot of articles try to place shift the blame onto the individual as if claiming "If YOU dont get the vaccine YOU will face the consequences of not being allowed to work"; when in really the language of these laws is tailored to the employers choice not the employee and should instead be reported as "If WE want to hinder our hiring pool to only vaccinated people we will" **You (the individual employee) are not choosing to be unemployed for not being vaccinated your boss is choosing to fire you** So no need to worry about whether they can or cant mandate this They wont do it because it will for certain cause a labor shortage to them and potentially a discrimination lawsuit if they use it as a reason to fire only the employees they dont like &#x200B; ps: if youre going to post the dumbass response of "many employers already mandate it hurr hurr hurr"; please enlighten us and list specifically which ones Yea Yea Yea you read some article saying that companies are going to do it Name then tell us specifically which companies are right now mandating the vaccine and have fired or are otherwise threatening to fire unvaccinated employees,AbortedBaconFetus,16223037430,3

h9x38c3,p9dd93,Ive been managing a remote engineering team for about 15 years- long long before Covid After managing onsite teams for about 15 before that It is IMHO night and day more difficult to manage the remote team And IMHO most of the issues solved by remote work are actually issues with horrible open offices and long commutes- not anything specifically to do with remote vs onsite work Some thoughts from doing this for over a decade: * 25% of people will be productive no matter where they are 25% will be problematic no matter where they are 50% of people work better with some form of office infrastructure Everyone thinks they are in that first 25% * Dealing with HR issues is much much more problematic with remote employees Try dealing with terming someone with a substance abuse problem when you never get to see them in person and dont have an attendance record to support your HR case * Peoples home environments are often horribly full of distractions People put up with this during Covid because there were no other alternatives- but having someones toddler running around screaming during meetings is an issue A good WFH environment will have a dedicated home office and a good WFH employee will have uninterrupted time in that office- but most dont have their home workspaces set up properly * Peoples WFH performance deteriorates over time- especially over many years Especially with employees with kids who only one parent is WFH Suddenly you realize that you are working around an employee who has to pick up the kids from school every day during work hours- folks start building lives/schedules around being able to disappear for a couple hours a day * There are simply no good current tech substitutes for a classic conference room whiteboard session Doing this remotely sucks All of that can be managed with appropriate focus/tools/etc But it adds substantially to the managerial effort required I think it seemed to work during Covid better than it would have because many tech firms paused or slowed down their project work during that period (I know all of my clients basically shelved most of the project deliverables last/this year and we are just now getting back to regular project planning cycles) Well see maybe Ill be wrong and the tech has progressed to the point where this will work I think the norm is going to become hybrid plans where folks are in the office a couple days a week but cant fully live anywhere they want,jakdak,16296461930,43

h9zjtur,p9dd93,I have lifelong friendships and business references from working with people in an office It sounds great maybe if you are young and still in touch with school/university people for your social life Even having offices move to WFH seems great because all your coworkers are in the same area and you already have closer bonds from knowing them in-person so even over video it seems a bit more fun Well over time workers will come and go and fewer and fewer new hires will be "local" to you Though you will have social "zoom meetings" it just wont have the same impact For the past 6 years Ive worked either remotely or with a large part of the team being remote so COVID wasnt the start of this for me As Ive noticed almost nobody keeps in touch after changing jobs from these remote teams Apart from perhaps a reference for a job application there is little to zero contact No long term friendships no long term anything Sure sometimes when someone would move to a new job you might chat quite a bit talk about things but usually those fizzle to zero rather quickly However I have plenty of friends held for decades gained from working together in person We still go out to hang talk over voice and chat play online and in-person games grab some drinks or see a show Those remote people on the "Chicago Team" of a job from five years ago I struggle to remember their names now Long term this will probably damage cities and urban centers Think the rise of the automobile and massive efficient highways created suburban sprawl? Hold your beer for the new WFH economy The continent will likely become coast to coast suburbs with neighbors with tall fences who hardly know each other Its okay you can watch movies in your home You can watch sports in your home You can see concerts in your home You can have your groceries delivered Fine dining some driving service will bring you food from that local restaurant if it really exists Perhaps Taco Bell now? Welcome to your home your prison I cant wait for the downvotes here I can almost smell them Of course some of what I am saying might not completely come to be but without a doubt its a strong possibility I guarantee this first taste of 100% remote working seems great now but long term the unintended consequences have not been fully considered And by the time those consequences are more strongly realized it would probably be impossible to go back to the office or at least a long uphill battle,RedditRage,16296866320,2

hceayd0,p9dd93,I am one of the people who never want to go back into the office after working about 20 years in corporate America I have embraced working from home since Covid started I love that I have down time in between meetings I can concentrate of work without disruptions grab some food and eat go sit on the deck for 15 minutes and get some sunshine and think I am a better employee and more productive I was having a conversation today with a co-worker and he thinks that things will be back to "normal" in corporate America in 3 years saying that he believes we will all be working back in the office again I said no way if a job can be done remote I believe a hybrid work environment will be embraced in a post-covid world and it will be more widely accepted to be working from home 3 years from now I am curious what others think Will corporate America have all of us working back in the office in 3 years?

h9yz7xr,p9dd93,At my company they are doing a blended work from home/work in the office to appease all of us who basically said well quit over this issue 80% of the company does not want to return to the office but seems like 100% of the office managers want us in there Ive been so much more productive at home and knowing we are about to redo the office layout I asked about the private office I was promised years ago I said I have the perfect set up at home where I can work undisturbed everyday and I really dont want to go back to my cubicle even though it has tall walls the few days I have come in Im back to getting 5 hours of real work done in an 8 hour days because of all the distractions and interruptions The office manager tells me "well actually were getting rid of more offices and removing the cubicle walls to have a more open office plan" I asked if that was a joke and he said "no itll be much better for our office culture" I said well I guess I wont be coming back in September then if thats the case That was a few weeks ago One of my co-workers sent me a message this week after seeing the new layout revision and I have an office with a door Dont give in to this if you really want to stay home and you truly are more productive People new to whatever your industry is are likely better off coming in and if youre at an intermediate level and expected to help train these staff you might have to show up a few days a week but dont roll over because youre told "oh everyone is coming back" Theyve been saying the same thing to me because Im one of the more vocal one asking why we are bothering returning to the office at all When Ive talked to people no one is actually excited to return The ones that have been coming back voluntarily have offices with doors and still only come in 1-2 days a week The others in cubicles are new hires and those with about a year of experience or field staff who never really came in the office during normal hours anyway,Silentnine,16296763960,1

h3yaqxw,ocwhp4,Im glad this is here because I didnt want to post and I cant So here is the thing before the pandemic I had asthma an issue I had struggled with all my life and more I constantly got sick starting usually with colds then respiratory infections walking neumona chronic sinus infections all of this before ultimately getting better and slowly starting the same cycle all over again from year to year with varying degrees of severity fluctuating throughout my life After 2020 specifically January or maybe December year previous I had come back home to Oregon because I was chronically ill and unable to eat food I had gone from 220lb to just 147 in two months That issue is still on going I only mention it to make known that I had previously been in a failed physical state as well prior to the outbreak When the outbreak occurred it did so in Hillsboro Oregon the city we lived in at the time and we had already been sick all of us with respiratory issues Something were all well familiar with and more and equipped to deal with it since it runs in the family It passed like nothing for my family but I as per usual began my long cycle starting with the initial cold step; however when it came to the respiratory infection step everything changed In the past my mucus at this point would be thick heavy and brown and it would make it extremely difficult and painful for me to remove it by force namely deliberately coughing it all up over and over again until all of it for that day was gone and then sleep rinse repeat until fully recovered people I am poor as SHIT! When its your whole Life! You find a way Anyways I got to that step but this time my mucus had changed It was now white like histamine light stringy and sticky This made it near impossible to cough out The only reason my method had worked in the past was because it was near solid when brown and I could use the muscles around my lungs to forcefully eject the solid mass once it had built to a certain level Now as right now it just stays as a light presence in my lungs but at that time I tried wildly to eject it to the point that I may have either dislocated my collar bone documented as having been dislocated as a child or my shoulder I dont know for sure I tried and failed but its ok I was for reasons I wont get into examined against my will at a hospital some time after these events and they cleared me as never having had the corona virus subsequently released from unmentioned hospital Since that time my mucus has not gone back to the way it was and Ive not gotten any colds sinus infections none of it I started gaining my weight back more my muscle is rebuilding with very little effort and I have not changed my diet I eat virtually nothing and I mean that I am daily on a starvation diet My wife currently is trying to follow me she is at 114lb meanwhile eating less than she does I currently am just under 180lb I ate steak two days ago I virtually only eat meat these days Here is what I know Prior to the outbreak I was withering and I had been fighting respiratory issues my whole life despite making more than the usual effort to maintain my health through rigorous diet and exercise which had wained in the last three years leading up due to family a child full time work and marital stress Currently I am demonstrably better No changes to my diet since 2019 which consist of regular daily fasting only drinking milk sometimes mixed with peanut butter and a banana once or twice daily and occasionally red meat and sea life No changes to my family whom I still continue to struggle with daily weighting heavily on my psyche Ive been out of work since 2019 so that has not changed but things overall in my family and my living situation has improved Nevertheless the bigger factory being diet has not changed but my mucus has Im writing this while caring for my eight month old son one of two so spare me some consideration here if youre still reading lol in conclusion I got better after the pandemic and although I was told I had not been infected I believe that I was and I also believe that Ive overall as a life form become stronger as a result Im changing physically and physiologically for my betterment and that makes me genuinely wonder if vaccinating myself against these possible natural dangers is not the wrong way to go?

Like We can still get it but similar to say a flu shot it isnt as likely and nowhere near as dangerous Now im being told that the delta variant makes the vaccine virtually useless so we are back to square one Im getting real tired trying to explain to the anti mask folks i live around that the vaccine is the way to go when i turn around and see that it might not work at all i have been kept away from going out and enjoying myself for almost 2 years now missed out on having a 21st birthday party and am getting real frustrated with everything Sorry for the rant but i have been playing ball this whole time and now im being told just as everything gets back to normal that we are back to square one and to return to existing by myself and continue avoiding other humans This isnt living am i crazy to rather risk my life and continue living life than stay in hiding?

hmvcllm,r6ejmd,Kinda makes sense omicron is more virulent (it seems) but less severe It has always been my impression that a virus "wants" to be less severe and more virulent After all a dead host cant spread a virus (or at least in any significant manner compared to a living virus factory) or make more viral particles A milder but longer last infection allows more virus to be made and to spread further This is what Ive picked up on over the years though so I maybe way off This could be the first signs of Covid becoming more akin to the flu,SonderEber,16384063050,2
hmtmnrx,r6ejmd,Lmao they know little to nothing about the OG covid 19 virus throw in mutations and it is a constant cycle of trying to catch up Alot of knowledge is coming from past experiences with coronaviruses but thats a very basic understanding that doesnt account for adaptations/mutation If they had an actual knowledge of what truly works with preventing or atleast decreasing symptoms we wouldnt be on shot #4 in a years time And before everyone says Im against vaccinations Im not However I will always be skeptical about any type of meds that are authorized for emergency use Time and results over the longterm will determine true effectiveness (And not saying we will but could just as easily find out that THIS vaccination COULD be doing more harm than good to our bodies) Tiny tidbit: my mother tested positive for Covid now 4-5 times hospitalized 3 of those times all in the past year (She has had all shots and boosters) kind of leads me to believe in a lack of effectiveness or I suppose false diagnosis (She is not only one I know just the closest to me that has tested positive and been hospitalized multiple times,Puzzleheaded-Yard891,16383815520,1

gud2as2,mpzwzj,For those of us reading this because we literally just got the J&J shot: 3 weeks with no issues and we are good to go? Do these clots happen more frequently on the front end and risk goes away with time? Or 2 years from now Im eating a sandwich and get a blood clot? Any way to know?,chuck543540,16183162790,9
gufb9d0,mpzwzj,Although I understand the concern its very possible this is a statistically normal phenomenon Heres some math to consider: The incidence of clots in women on oral contraceptives is 03%-1% over 10 years There are about 65 million women age 18-50 in the US About 14% are on the pill That means at the high end of the range you could expect 24 women per day could get a clot (ie 9000000\*001/3650 = 24) If we assume the distribution of the JnJ vaccine wasnt demographically biased (which may not be the case but the data on it should be available) then 7000000\*65000000/330000000\*014 = 193000 were women age 18-48 on oral contraceptives This is about 214% of all women in that demographic So over the course of a month you would expect those women to be responsible for 00214\*24\*30 = 154 clots at the high end of the normal risk range and 46 at the low end of the range The actual reported number was 6 Even assuming 50% reporting this is well within the normal range And that doesnt even account for pregnant women who also have an increased risk of clots Running the numbers for 54 million pregnant women (at any given time) each with a 01% chance of developing a clot Therefore on any given day you could expect 5400000\*0001/280 = 193 pregnant women to experience a clot or 580 in the course of a month Now granted pregnant women may have been less likely to get the vaccine (although its reportedly safe during pregnancy) BUT lets ignore that potential bias for a minute and assume that 5400000/330000000\*7000000 = 115000 pregnant women got the vaccine in the last month Those women would be responsible for 115000/5400000\*580 = 124 additional clots over the course of that month So under totally regular circumstances it wouldnt be abnormal for 27 out of the 3500000 women in question to get a clot in a given month This leaves a lot of room for the potential effect of biases in these stats Its obviously critical to verify all this though so I understand why the CDC would want to shut things down while they delve into the data Hindsight is 20/20 but I would say its really not surprising this was the main adverse event that was reported Women age 18-48 have a very very low rate of sudden unexpected mortality due to an adverse clinical event Even though the survival rate for a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is 95% that 5% is a significant number for individuals who are otherwise totally healthy Id be willing to bet its one of the top sudden physiological causes of mortality in the demographic in question Glancing at the data for the AstraZeneca vaccine it seems very similar Im curious -- have no patients who got the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines experienced clots?

We went in the space of a couple weeks from firing unvaccinated healthcare workers because they MIGHT get covid and MIGHT go to work with it before they realize theyre contagious to directly telling sick workers to report to work after testing positive and still being contagious Im not sure whats guiding us right now but it sure as crap isnt science Id say I cant believe how quickly the CDC bowed to corporate pressure but theyve been a complete disaster since the very beginning of this pandemic TWO YEARS AGO and have learned nothing so maybe I can believe it The idea that "most of the transmission occurs in these 5 days so its not a big deal" may or may not be true but just to put it into perspective the numbers I saw indicated that you are about 30 times more likely to spread covid outside this window than you are to die of covid if you catch it Would we say "Most of the people who catch covid wont die so its not a big deal"? Absolutely not! Weve been saying things like "Wear masks they arent perfect but every little bit helps" "Skip christmas every little bit helps" "get vaccinated every little bit helps"and then we turn around say "You know what nevermind everyone come on back to work even though we KNOW some of you will STILL be contagious" Funny how only individuals are asked to sacrifice to make every little bit help,Krytan,16416687040,9

"Its not sustainable or affordable to buy every person on the planet a new car each year" Regardless hard to believe that this wouldnt be a solvable problem Especially with variants more likely to come from unvaccinated populations (in poorer countries) theres a huge incentive to build out vaccination infrastructure I wonder how perceptions will change in the future Theres a lot of frustrated "Im done with this" comments in this thread which is fair enough I guess but for me personally if it were a 15 minute errand each year to get a booster / update and mitigate some of the risk of getting covid I cant imagine why I wouldnt do that Ive been getting the flu shot for years Even if it were just a mild reduction in the chances of contracting a mild illness I would still do that,pseudont,16413323950,0

hqripxf,rt54vc,TLDR; If youre using an antigen at-home rapid test wait until 2-3 days after symptom onset (but quarantine before then ofc) Family of 4 (50M 14F 16F 22F (myself)) We were exposed to COVID either on Christmas or the 26th (a close family friend (50Ms girlfriends son 15M with whom he was in the car with for 3+hours on the 26th) had a fever on the 26th confirmed positive PCR test on the 28th) Weve been quarantining since the 26th Day 0: 50M 16F and I took a QuickVue antigen test on the 28th They were all negative At this point 50M had a scratchy throat and was mildly coughing The rest of us had no symptoms I started getting a tickly throat (that feeling of "oh here it comes") late at night Didnt test 14F that night because the tests arent cheap :) and we were quarantining anyways At this point if one of us had it the rest of us did Day 1: The next morning 14F woke up with a fever Myself and 16F woke up with sore throats a headache fatigue and coughing 50M stayed the same I felt pretty rough that night had intense night-sweats and lots more coughing 14F broke her fever half-way through the day Day 2: 14F and 16F are feeling much better! Yay! Hardly any symptoms just mild coughing and runny nose I have worse coughing fatigue scratchy throat runny nose nausea 50M doing pretty much the same as he was--just a scratchy throat and coughing At this point its just been a bad cold for us or akin to a case of bronchitis We all took more at-home tests: 2 QuickVue 2 BinaxNOW All 4 came back positive Day 3 (today): 50M lost his sense of smell dampened sense of taste This didnt happen during his first run with COVID (April 2020) Still has similar symptoms but theyve gotten better Im doing much better still occasionally coughing & headaches/cold symptoms 14F and 16F are practically symptom-free now just a bit of coughing 14F and 16F were 2x Pfizer vaccinated in June 2021 (date of second dose) 50M was 2x Moderna vaccinated in January 2021 but caught COVID early-on from hospital work in April 2020 Was a fairly severe case lasted 15 months but no hospitalization I was vaccinated 2x Pfizer in April 2021 None of us received the booster yet I think we all caught Omicron as the symptoms are relatively mild 14F 16F and I have never had COVID before A bit sad we caught it after 2 years of not catching it 50M isnt as cautious with masking/avoiding crowded areas procedures as we are Some anecdotal evidence if you will We all tested negative the first round of testing and all tested positive the second round of testing So you may want to wait until 2-3 days after the start of symptoms before you do an at-home test Best of luck to everyone!

Done Dancing way too close to people? Check Drinking a Corona from a bartender who totally put her lime in my drink with the same hand she grabbed my cash? Yup! All in baby I came home and when I woke up on Monday I had an awful cold I had read a story about someone saying if youre vaxxed and you have a cold its possibly COVID I was paranoid So I got a rapid test right away Negative But fuck that I want to make sure sure So I got the longer 24-72 test By Tuesday I felt fine It turns out it was just allergies Going from a hyper clean AirBnB to my house which is Im comparison kinda dusty kicked my ass I also forgot to take my nasal spray the day before But I still wanted that negative test And I got it yesterday (47 hours after I got tested) Negative again So I got absurdly lucky Either I interacted with someone with COVID and the vaccine did a kickass job or I got even luckier and in a COVID hot spot I didnt bump into COVID at all I will say that any girls I hooked up and managed to actually talk to (about half) were out of towners from liberal states and all got the vaccine Anyway the vaccine (PFIZER) I got helped me feel like I wasnt in peril I have asthma so Im sure COVID would do a number on my lungs I dont think it will kill me probably especially with the vaccine but any further lung damage would be life changing I just stopped needing an inhaler within the last 5 or so years Is there a point to this way way too long message? Just that I felt like the vaccine would help me And Im pretty sure it did It was a gamble for sure but also a mental thing I think me and all my friends really needed 88% is damn good odds PS Nashville is fucking awesome Its like a 3-1 ratio girls to guys Its like Tinder but in real life and you have such a better shot with every girl out there When everything is cool again (assuming it ever is) check it out Edit: firstly shame a positive vaccine story gets downvoted here but fine Guess I wont be defending this shit anymore Good luck,PeterDarker,16269960890,-3

The Corona Cabinet approved: Insulation for returnees from abroad African variant Omicron (Photo: Reuters) South Africa has transferred new information to Israel - and this is the data | Photo: Reuters The contradictory messages of vaccine manufacturers The test of the effectiveness of existing vaccines against the new variant was in its infancy but Modern CEO Stefan Bensel managed to arouse global concern today when he said in an interview with the Financial Times that he expects a significant decrease in vaccine efficacy But Bensel spoke of a decline in benefit from a disease with symptoms rather than a serious illness - a difference that is known to be dramatic in corona contexts as Pfizer CEO Albert Burla was apt to describe: Defense compared to Delta but that would be the limit In both cases the booster vaccines are expected to reduce the gap dramatically " Burla who promised to know more about the benefits of the vaccine against the variant in about a week and a half said Pfizer had already begun developing a specific vaccine against the variant a few days ago "We know the genetic linkage of the virus we have it - thats how it starts" he explained "We started at risk to produce a vaccine We actually started on Friday to produce a vaccine based on the flooring the DNA template that would allow us to make RNA that would eventually women within that vaccine" Israel meanwhile is waiting for a more categorical statement from the two CEOs and meanwhile relies on data coming from South Africa - where the variant was first discovered - and from which it appears that the omicron is more contagious but is no more violent "Data on the benefits of the vaccine - there may be some partial data from South Africa" Dr Sharon Elrai-Price head of public health services said today during a debate in the Knesset I know they are doing the lab tests as I described to see how useful the vaccine against this variant is " Bennett worried: "There is a lot of uncertainty" Albert Burla and Naftali Bennett (Adapted by Reuters) Burla optimistic Bennett explains why he activated the GSS | Arrangement: Reuters At the same time the government is today approving a memorandum of law that will allow it to extend the decision to allow the GSS to verify the cellular devices of those infected with Omicron or the suspects who were infected with it with high probability - in order to interrupt the transmission chains as quickly as possible But just before the move reaches the Knesset the coalition itself is sharply critical of the law Prime Minister Bennett - who saw for himself how in the ministers WhatsApp groups Ministers Saar Shasha-Bitton Barbibai and Avidar voted against - told today why Israel decided to include the GSS in the campaign despite and perhaps because it is a low number of infected "There is a lot of uncertainty and that is why we are taking these extreme measures" he said in a video call with Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schlenberg "But our advantage as leaders is that once we know more when there is more information - we can let go of those measures gradually" As for the restrictions at Ben Gurion Airport the prime minister has already decided that these will last about two weeks from the date of the decision - and only if the final proof does come that the variant does not endanger the populations immunity or the omicron is already spread in the community - these restrictions will be removed Yaron Avraham participated in the preparation of the article,Serenity101,16383425550,2
hmq9bde,r5ueps,Its important to note that Israel counts those eligible for a booster but who havent gotten a booster shot as among the unvaccinated I would speculate that this means that those who have received no vaccine are more than twice as must at risk for serious illness From the Google translated page: "another worrying statistic was discovered regarding the unvaccinated: their risk of becoming seriously ill is 24 times the original strain of the coronavirus the one that arrived in israel nearly two years ago in "unvaccinated" it also refers to those vaccinated in two doses who are entitled to boosters and have not yet been vaccinated and therefore their protection is insufficient",jpoteet2,16383161890,1

hnflckn,r9otza,Ive been teaching in China for 18 years and this is par for the course Ill first say Ive always worked in the private sector and there have been times that Ive been outsourced to public schools on occasion while working with a few schools in the past What a gong show Not criticizing China Just humanity in general So I came **right** after the WHO lifted the SARS travel ban to China Id planned on moving to China earlier and SARS ended up delaying my departure by a few months There are always sick kids coming to school It really broke my heart Id see kids as young as 4 years old coming to class run down and sick It just made me think "if youre going to run your kid into the ground like this at this age what kind of physical condition can you expect them to be in when theyre 30?" When H1N1 was a thing I was working 3 afternoons a week at a high school and DAMN I had classes where students were constantly going to the bathroom to puke their guts out 1/4-1/3 of the students were clearly effected I constantly encouraged them to go home but they didnt see it as an option because their teachers and parents didnt accept the practice of saying home to get better and not risk spreading their illness to others A few years later I had a kid come to school looking kinda sick and before class I asked the girls mother and she upright admitted that she was aware that her child was infected with FMD which can be extremely fatal to humans who are younger/have less developed immune systems I couldnt believe this woman I informed my co-workers of the situation We immediately locked all of the classrooms because we didnt want anyone in the other classrooms to get infected It literally took over an hour to convince the mother to take her child out of the school It was literally impossible to convince her that shed done something wrong by taking her child outside let alone to a school filled with other younglings She attempted to fight the manager when we told her that she wouldnt be able to bring her child back into the school without proof from a local hospital that her daughter was no longer contagious After the insane woman left we spent a few hours sanitizing everything in the school It must have been a weird experience for the kids and teachers in the other classrooms They normally would have finished class a long time ago and would have been let out of the classroom for breaks but they had to just hang out in the classroom while we insured that wed done our best to make sure it was safe for the kids to come out TBH we shouldnt have had anything to do with this process There should have been some division of the government to contact to have them ensure that this is done properly especially given how this disease is famous for coming through areas and taking the lives of children in waves but yeah we didnt have such a luxury at our disposal COVID wasnt nearly as bad The government had clearly learned from SARS and figured out a way to deal with it in their own way After the COVID lockdown had ended it was really nice to see so many kids come to class wearing masks I even had co-workers wearing masks when they had a cold which is something I couldnt have imagined happening ever before COVID COVID really made me question why the hell we havent been wearing masks when under the weather all of these years I think it should be a given You shouldnt be free to spread your germs when youre feeling ill just regardless of whether or not you live in a free country,ThaddCorbett,16387743750,13

hfkfxux,q2ckda,The creation of a second class citizen group based on medical choice is a fascinating philosophical question that I dont think people are taking very seriously at the moment At the moment for most people this situation seems very cut and dry: "Get vaccine which helps you & others or else suffer the consequences" There are many good public health reasons to encourage vaccination - both via carrots and sticks However moving this premise out 20- 30- 50 years from now as technology advances would we feel comfortable with the same principles applying to other medical interventions? If we discovered a way (gattaca-style) to make some genetic tweaks that ensured a person would be at a much reduced chance for disease transfer in the future -- would that be okay to mandate (or deny services to that person if they didnt receive the genetic tweak)? Maybe so Maybe as society/ technology changes its entirely fine to mandate such things Its just an interesting philosophical question that I think we arent giving full consideration to yet,paro54,16334942450,126

h8f0php,p1oqh4,Its no shocker to me A lot of my family and friends live in Florida Back in late June i went down to surprise my father for his 69th birthday I thought since I was fully vaccinated and cases were at their lowest since the start of the pandemic there was never going to be a better time to go I hadnt seen him in 10 years I wasnt sure I would see him again so I took the risk and drove down This trip was highly unusual Normally I would get in contact with everyone and try to spend time with as many people as I could This was more a top secret mission Ive been paying attention to everyones social media posts I knew since i had a high risk son at home there were many folks I did not want to see (He has heart failure one kidney and immuno-compromised from a cancer diagnosis as a toddler)The need to know list was minimal Even though neither of my parents are vaccinated I knew it was ok to visit my father He is living off the system and had most things delivered at his home He only left to buy cigarettes and beer and got them at a window I asked my mom to get tested because she hasnt changed her way of living since all this started Anti masker bible thumping Christian who goes to church and Costco twice a week This church sets aside a half hour after service for fellowship community dining and affection(hugging and spreading love) I visited a handful of friends One group knew i was coming down before anyone else They all were fully vaccinated and quarantined themselves before I arrived Chatting with them made me realize that most Floridians just dont care about following the rules Its always been business as usual down there Theres been major events like concerts live DJ performances and parties weekly Ive seen tons of posts from packed venues Nobody wearing masks all crammed tightly in a building One night I visited my best friend since high school We got to chat while smoking a fat bowl (she bought a new piece just for me for my visit) and she said it perfectly "Florida just dont give a fuck about Covid" Its that frame of mind why Florida will be hit mega hard by this variant Theres a huge number of unvaccinated people down there You have the younger crowd partying like its 1999 mixing with a massive older retired population A recipe for disaster Even with this new variant and numbers skyrocketing they still just dont care With Summer coming to a close soon all of the snowbirds will start arriving again Just in time as the Delta is getting in gear I probably shouldnt have taken the drive down or seen as many people as I did But like I said cases were at their lowest and most of the small number of people I visited were vaccinated I caught a lot of flak once everyone found out I was down and never stopped in Those that knew I was coming also knew the situation with my son and took precaution Most of the time spent together was outdoors and distanced at a persons home The only home I went in was my Fathers I knew it was only a matter of time before a new variant swept through the Sunshine State Im glad I went when I did My dad is a chain smoker and ex hardcore drug addict I never once seen him eat when i was there Beer and cigarettes thats it Didnt matter if it was 8 in the morning or midnight Alcohol and nicotine If you heard him cough you would know he doesnt have much time left on Earth I had to go down to see him when the opportunity was there,ac1dre1gn77,16286075150,97

h8fv8hj,p1oqh4,There are two factors at play here: * Floridas state ban on school mask mandates * Increased Transmission from Delta There have been some [pretty robust](https://wwwnytimescom/2021/08/10/opinion/covid-schools-maskshtml) [studies](https://abcsciencecollaborativeorg/report-shows-that-n-c-k-12-schools-reopened-safely-paving-the-way-for-schools-nationwide-to-limit-covid-19-spread-in-the-classroom/) that show that at least for last years variants in-person education had very low transmission rates so long as everyone was wearing masks So the question is how much of this transmission is due to students not masking and how much is due to the increased transmission rate of the Delta variant? As the parent of kids who are in a school district thats headed back to in-person-with-masks-required school in a few weeks my hope is that masks are still effective enough to allow for safe in-person learning until under-12s can get vaccinated But we really dont know that yet If my kids were headed back to school tomorrow with the data we have available today in an environment where masks are required Id likely send them with N95 masks But well see what things look like in a few weeks when I have to make that decision for realsies,AtOurGates,16286203390,3

hl0mlwa,qw0f3o,said this in another thread but got no replies maybe someone will discuss here i wonder what the history of some of our current 3+ series vaccines are (mmr etc) when they first came out its likely the perfect regimen wasnt ironed out the first year of distribution its not fun to be the ones to have to "fuck around and find out" re: how long and well our current vaccines last but i still have hope for more stability in the long term - studies may show that a much longer interval between the first doses is more optimal and thats what will be given to children going forward etc hopefully mutations will tamp down when the entire world has significantly more coverage (rn 50% of the entire world has 1 dose obviously lopsided af but not bad for less than a year out) hopefully itll stabilize to something like our current vaccines many of which have boosters 10 years out from a 2 or 3 part series or sooner if titers indicate its needed,curiosity676,16371731690,21

Yes But why does every author need to look backwards at casualties and suggest that we should continue to live a life of covered faces and limited contacts? Do they actually think thats a viable long term solution?
