ho1fm7h,rdg5q3,If anyone thinks that child sex trafficking is fake news then you havent been paying attention to what happens every year in our country and the poorest countries around the world! These people prey on the poor just as they abuse them for work they also use them for their own devious purposes! This is as old as our history MEN have sought out the vulnerable and taken advantage of them and abused them for whatever purpose they wanted! As a survivor of this type of destructive behavior it has taken me a long time to realize that it wasnt my fault but it breaks you down piece by piece until you start self medicating and then you are deemed a delinquent though the judges and lawyers know what happens when a child is thrust into something like this they have no compassion for the children they add abuse on top of the abuse! We have tried to bury this stuff for too long and it is time for those who are elected to protect and serve have to be held accountable and forced to start doing their job! I could tell all of the heart wrenching stories but it will not help to change some of the peoples minds that are in charge! The only time that they come close to caring is when it happens to a child of status and even then they try to bury it! They have the money to pay off the officials in the right places and it just keeps happening! I spent most of my life with anger and self medication and it hasnt really been much help I hope that this is a start to holding them accountable maybe this one woman will open the door for all to see just how pervasive this really is but she is going to have to draw a roadmap to how these people do the things they do!

ho16sji,rdg5q3,So here is my take Ive been reading about satanic sex cults and Pizzagate for about 5 years But Ive really never been given any hard evidence that it all exists What I have found is that the Religious right is very obsessed with grouping sex workers and pornography with "sex trafficking of minors" into the same group this makes it a LOT easier to condemn all 3 and harder to fight against legislation that limits say strip clubs Because if a strip club is a possible "sex ring" then we cant be opposed to THAT right?

Wrong they or their family just were willing to kill or do what ever was necessary to gain the power Even though shit doesnt make since to these normies its to difficult to except how fucked we are I guess or maybe they relate to the evil people and would do the same things if they had the chance I could never blindly listen and obey I question everything around me in the pursuit of knowledge and enlightenment Constantly thinking about how I can improve and better myself with my main focus being to spread love and happiness unity Unfortunately normies are to busy hating each other taking every word said on their favorite MSM source like its the holy gospel It really saddens me how bad this has gotten Dont just believe anything someone is telling you everyone has their own agenda My agenda is to unite and for The People to see how loving each other can change our lives and that we can easily do so much better then the evil people in power Their is only on thing more powerful then hate and that is love The agenda of the evil people who have worked very hard doing what ever neccessary to gain power and money is to keep that power,dillmayne2sweet,16249647110,3

guqfr1c,ms2o0d,What gets me its a couple things about how the system is fucked 1- we tax payers give grant money to smaller pharmaceutical companies The big companies dont want to do research and make medicine for very specific diseases that are rare and only affect a smaller pool of the population they want big net many fish So these smaller companies know this so they know they only way they can compete Id by looking for what disease is getting ignored/not being addressed directly so that becomes their niche But they dont have the money so they get a grant from the government This boosts their budget they increase employment and research and voila theyve created a treatment Now here comes the bigger pharmaceutical companies they see the need medicine and buy out the smaller company They then in turn self the new product at an outrageous price Talk about a winning scenario All you got to do is wait for a smaller company to get grant money do all the work and just buy them So we as tax payers pay to have these medicines made just to then pay for them at a steeper price and we dont get the grant money back 2- There is so much money in lobbying from Pharmaceutical companies (#1 lobbying industry by far) that they were able to convince Congress to vote against themselves being able to negotiate Medicare pharmaceutical prices with those companies A major reason these companies love America is because every other first world country has a system in place to make sure prices dont get out of hand We are their cash cow 3- Along with the pharmaceutical industry the health insurance industry (another top lobbying industry) is also a giant racket that takes advantage of us all These companies have done an amazing job to label things like universal healthcare as "socialist" and yea it might be but they dont care about that they just want you to be afraid of it because it would lead to them losing money The other thing that gets me is people who say "I dont want to pay for your insurance" thing is you already do we already do When an uninsured person goes to the ER they have to be treated When they cant pay the hospital gets that money through the insured by up charging everything Healthcare shouldnt be a for profit business at least to a point Healthcare doesnt fit the traditional supply and demand economic model of capitalism because the demand is always going to be high People are willing to spend whatever it takes to be alive You cant put a price on your life and theres companies know this Need a new heart? Well there isnt a discount store for that heres your bill Need life saving insulin? Well pay our prices because we convinced the government its illegal to go to Canada for 1/10 the price Healthcare and medicine shouldnt be political We put the most into our broken system than any other country and we get the least out of it All we have to do is follow the money and see whos profiting because odds are theyre the ones who stand to lose the most by changing the system Its the same thing with all the sentiment against renewable energy Whos profiting now and whos going to lose out by going to renewable energy?

he wrote a White House official that he was in favor of a "National Endowment in support of free institutions throughout the world" >The NED was initially placed under the auspices of the National Security Council and one Walter Raymond Jr a CIA propaganda expert who according to the late Robert Parry for years acted as liaison between the program and Casey Raymond also drew charming doodles like this depicting himself as a literal puppeteer controlling many different strings >The organization was stacked with prominent neoconservatives like Lane Kirkland John Richardson and Allen Weinstein Carl Gershman a longtime professional anticommunist was its first and so far only president One of its current board members Elliott Abrams is a war criminal with a history of subverting democracy overseas >To prevent the odor of US imperialism from contaminating the NEDs work the Reagan administration made it a private organization that in turn funded several more private institutions including the NDI and IRI But the fact that it was routinely staffed with former US officials and got its funding from the US government has always made this a dubious conceit >Equally dubious was the idea that its task was simply to promote democracy Two of its "core grantees"  which receive around 70 percent of its funding  are explicitly right wing: the IRI which is a GOP-led institution that once described its goals as advancing "democracy the rule of law and free-market economics"; and the Center for International Private Enterprise a project of the **US Chamber of Commerce** Even the Solidarity Center (formerly the Free Trade Union Institute) which is affiliated with the **AFL-CIO** went on to support conservative causes Only the NDI the Democrats arm could be said to be anywhere left of center Overall the NEDs track record tilts decidedly to the right CIPE and The Solidarity Center are two of the four grantees of the [NED](https://wwwsolidaritycenterorg/national-endowment-for-democracy-ned-ndi-iri-cipe-and-solidarity-center-welcome-increased-funding-from-congress/) NED does what the CIA used to do behind closed doors I thought the NED was pretty interesting considering Time Magazines story about the secret shadow campaign to save the [2020 election](https://timecom/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/) The article mentions multiple times how the group was working to protect and save Democracy (democracy is used ~33 times in the article) The article also outlines an alliance that included the AFL-CIO and the US Chamber of Commerce: >The pact was formalized in a terse little-noticed joint statement of the US Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO published on Election Day This article from [socialismcom](https://socialismcom/fs-article/betrayal-from-venezuela-to-iraq-the-afl-cio-and-the-national-endowment-for-democracy/) discusses how NED is a CIA front is funded by the US government and works closely with the leaders of the AFL-CIO: >A little-known far-right organization with a warm and fuzzy name the National Endowment for Democracy is up to no good in at least 40 countries That is bad enough especially given that the money for NEDs dirty deeds comes from working taxpayers courtesy of the US Congress Truly appalling however is the role that leaders of the AFL-CIO the largest US labor federation play in carrying out the work of this agency > A CIA front is born During the late 1970s the CIA was exposed for its active sabotage of numerous governments and progressive labor movements abroad Not so publicized was the AFL-CIOs role in aiding the CIA >Operating through the American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD) the AFL-CIO aided the overthrow of democratically elected governments in Guyana in 1963 Brazil in 1964 the Dominican Republic in 1965 and Chile in 1973 These are just a few examples of labor officialdoms shameful record in helping to carry out corporate-propelled US foreign policy >In 1983 after the CIA was widely discredited Ronald Reagans administration created a new agency the NED to take care of old business As an NED founder Allen Weinstein put it in 1991: "A lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA" >In his hard-hitting book Rogue State: A Guide to the Worlds Only Superpower William Blum describes some of the agencys activities "NED successfully manipulated elections in Nicaragua in 1990 and Mongolia in 1996 helped to overthrow democratically elected governments in Bulgaria in 1990 and Albania in 1991 and 1992 and was busy working in Haiti in the late 1990s on behalf of rightwing groups **NED like the CIA before it calls what it does supporting democracy** The governments and movements whom the NED targets call it destabilization" From the [Time 2020 election story:](https://timecom/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/) >"The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation" says Norm Eisen >The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation >The system didnt work magically Democracy is not self-executing" >And they believe the public needs to understand the systems fragility in order to ensure that democracy in America endures,Settlemente,16187557890,1

Nothing ever really came from it yet other than their arrest and theres no way theyd give up anyone willingly All of the implicated people have denied wrongdoing and its not like the courts have hauled anyone else in They were arrested for trafficking underage girls So where are the arrests of the johns? Or anyone else since this was a criminal network Way too many people knew what was going on for so few to be held accountable The Clintons and Gates know they can always downplay accusations as conspiracy theory nonsense because no one will even investigate them which is pretty crazy when you consider the fact that we actually did haul him into a courtroom before over a stained dress Underage girls being trafficked in order to gain compromising evidence over politicians and other powerful people? Shit should be the permastory that Trump-Russia was for years being constantly covered and dug into (Funny that theres not an endless supply of secret govt sources giving the media juicy bits huh?)

Because the implication that Bezos is just shunting this money from pocket to pocket is wildly inaccurate Even if he could do that the SEC would come down on him like a ton of bricks if he did so Plus Amazon doesnt need the money They can float the $85B to buy MGM all on their own without their founders help Okay so next The tweet says "Senate is considering" which if you understand how the Senate works is code for "some Senator introduced an amendment" but said in a way that tries to make it sound more like the whole Senate is unified in this direction In fact there is an active amendment already being floated to block the previous amendment which amounts to pork-barrelling If you want to learn more about this please check out these articles: * https://theinterceptcom/2021/05/25/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-senate-bailout/ -- "Cantwells amendment is no sure bet [] Bernie Sanders [] introduced a last-minute amendment Monday to eliminate the $10 billion [saying] It does not make a lot of sense to me that we would provide billions of dollars to a company owned by the wealthiest guy in America Sanders told The Intercept Tuesday" * https://wwwwashingtonpostcom/technology/2021/05/21/elon-musk-jeff-bezos-moon-rivalry/ * https://thehillcom/homenews/senate/555426-senate-competitiveness-bill-includes-10b-authorization-for-bezos-space,Tyler_Zoro,16223809920,24

hmqllrs,r602yz,Good on you dude! This is a prime example of how much better society could function if we didnt all just sit around assuming someone else will take care of this issue especially such a morally corrupt one like exploiting kids So many people just assume this is what the FBI or police handle at best theyll report it but then theyll move on and likely that monster continues making a profit on the exploitation of children So its rad to see you actually took it upon yourself to see this through and its great to see at least one piece of filth has now had their legs cut out from beneath them Id be really cautious about working with anyone from the FBI though Especially after recent events seeing how the FBI has been so directly involved with instigating events like the "kidnapping" of Governor Whitmer the January 6 FBI-lead event and the 2020 rioting Not to mention the FBIs history of covering up real proven child trafficking/exploitation operations This isnt even touching all of the speculation (without much evidence) about the FBI being directly involved in protecting the large child trafficking/porn producers if not actively participating in the creation of it themselves Not to say the ***entire*** FBI is corrupt filled with monsters who wont just ignore these sorts of charges theyll actively work to cover-up and bury it then silence you But it certainly seems like the integral cogs in the FBI machine are not very concerned with really digging deep into who operates the major trafficking/child porn productioncould be theyre involved in the facilitation themselves or the sad reality the FBI is morally corrupt ineffectual dinosaur institution who will no longer or can no longer uphold their duty to justice :/,flichter,16383217060,6

h88st99,p0j98z,The world is like a ride in an amusement park and when you choose to go on it you think its real because thats how powerful our minds are The ride goes up and down around and around it has thrills and chills and its very brightly colored and its very loud and its fun for a while Many people have been on the ride a long time and they begin to wonder "Hey is this real or is this just a ride?" And other people have remembered and they come back to us and say "Hey dont worry; dont be afraid ever because this is just a ride" And we  kill those people "Shut him up! Ive got a lot invested in this ride shut him up! Look at my furrows of worry look at my big bank account and my family This has to be real" Its just a ride But we always kill the good guys who try and tell us that you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok  But it doesnt matter because its just a ride And we can change it any time we want Its only a choice No effort no work no job no savings of money Just a simple choice right now between fear and love The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors buy guns close yourself off The eyes of love instead see all of us as one Heres what we can do to change the world right now to a better ride Take all that money we spend on weapons and defenses each year and instead spend it feeding and clothing and educating the poor of the world which it would pay for many times over not one human being excluded and we could explore space together both inner and outer forever in peace,QuotesBillHicks,16284780350,29

h1qdgrf,nzlzfq,Youre absolutely right but its a much more extensive issue that your post taps into: namely the way that the environmental movement (and all of the various environmental groups like Greenpeace) was hijacked by corporations to push the global warming narrative which has completely overshadowed every other environmental issue for activists and which pins the blame on workers and lower classes and lets the corporations escape blame justice or all responsibility for cleaning up the damage they have done to the planet It started with the Thatcher government in the UK she deliberately funded research to prove carbon emissions had a negative impact so that she could break the backs of the coal miners who were striking It was a deliberate strategy to completely destroy organized labour and it worked and her counterpart in USA Ronnie Ray-Gun was busy doing the same thing dismantling any corporate controls and regulations while simultaneously destroying organized labour Both were agents of the new corporate tyranny The Gilets Jaunes movement in France encapsulates this perfectly: how its a class issue and how the global warming legislation hurts working class people Environmental Activists used to protest major corporations and financial institutions and government institutions nuclear power plant protests factory farms oil refineries hijacking pipelines etc but what happened with this psyop is that the shift led to the faux activism of Greta and Extinction Rebellion (which again attacks working class people by blocking them from going to work etc) which mostly replaced and distracted from the real issues The entire debate has been reframed with "deniers" on one side and on the other side if you care about the environment then you affirm the official narrative and therefore agree with the laws Both sides are incorrect because the entire framing is incorrect The way I approach it is I simply focus on the more existential and urgent environmental issues like microplastics in every living being on the plant for instance and 99% of the time these are the direct result of multinational corporations So take the environmental position but just sidestep the framing and address the real issues: nobody can attack you for actually caring about the environment and instead of getting distracted by entangling yourself in the pro or con global warming game just step back and realize its a psyop People are being pushed to fear something that isnt concretely evident to them a narrative that isnt intuitive (the idea that carbon which is necessary for plants is dangerous and an existential threat -- which by the way Im neither affirming nor denying Im simply stating that you cant see it with your own eyes so it becomes a "trust the experts" issue) while the things that are concretely evident like plastic pollution are being demoted to the bottom of the concern list But people can see with their own eyes the way that giant corporations are destroying the planet The evidence is overwhelming Now the next step is to realize that this exact same formula and process applies to every other major issue from war to immigration Start with the shift from class to race/ identity: From 2008-10 there was mass mobilization of workers and activism focused on class (the 99% vs the 1%) where the masses were joining together and attacking wallstreet and giant corporations So again we see the exact same pattern: the Occupy movement being hijacked and overshadowed by BLM and LGBTQ identity politics and also the exact same formula applies to the Covid-19 narrative and the risks and dangers of the virus and also the vaccine The MO is the same (and it also happened in the 60s with COINTELPRO) Its crystal clear once you put it together Chomskys Manufacturing Consent outlines the Modus Operandi for all of these propaganda and psyop campaigns pushed through by corporate media,FruitFlavor12,16236799210,53

hia4rs5,qh1mh5,Adderall is similar to methamphetamine but so is phenylethylamine a common additive to energy drinks and pre-workout The brains of those with adhd is visibly and markedly different structurally and functionally There is far less circulating dopamine norepinephrine and serotonin than in the neurotypical Stimulants like adderall increase the circulating volume of dopamine and bring the adhd brain up to a level of functionality that most enjoy There is no science of any kind to support the idea that this condition can simply be reduced to "not wanting to sit still" Also with behavior modification adderall prescribed in the developmental window increases neuroplasticity allowing for the adhd sufferer to develop the structural/functional abilities to focus and improve executive functioning Dont offer cartoonish reductionism simply because you are ignorant of the neuroscience of the condition,deadwards14,16353605670,49

i0zezv3,tg0kom,I posted this almost a year ago and have kept copying and pasting it because a lot of it has come true since then Ill warn you its long though This is a copy from another post but lines up the events of history that are being copied right now And why so many *Financial Issues* are being disguised (such as climate issues or pandemic issues) But a lot of this has happened before and is being full-on copied from other time periods and how even blackrock (the single largest hedge fund and called "The Fourth Branch of the US Government by Forbes and Bloomberg) [wrote the entire financial blueprint of what was going to happen before covid even started back in August 2019](https://wwwblackrockcom/corporate/literature/whitepaper/bii-macro-perspectives-august-2019pdf) Were seeing a complete system change why we needed to pump out a ton of money (literally 40% of all Dollars in existence were created in the last year) and why we need a WORLDWIDE unique Identification system tied to single individuals and a unique ID (a passport that is financial in its requirement but right now is being pushed through medical global requirements) Corona is a financial issue disguised as a pandemic issue because it can circumvent local laws and force the wordlwide laws Climate change is a financial issue being disguised as an ecosystem issue because again those laws are "bigger" than local laws and can circumvent normal procedures ----- We know "follow the money" to be the oldest and truest sense of deducing whats going on One of the things that stands out is that this event is following exactly the same events of the 20s and 70s Both times marked by huge inflation both times marked by a currency change and a new system and both times marked by a war that took place to get rid of the old system and expand the system while countries are hit hard by inflation But they all follow the same play ook = a massive amount of money was printed out and a certain assets price was then crashed that people were holding onto In the 20s-30s the asset was gold (whos price skyrocketed as money was printed and then crashed right before a market crash) and now with crypto currency (bitcoin was $7200 in january 2020 and got up to $60000 before crashing down to $32000 and flying back up to $65000 again and will probably crash even further once again before the final drop before it raises to crazy levels in ten years) In the case of gold the conspiracy is that two men formed a group and tried to corner the market and then the US released all its gold shares to crash that market and everyone sold their gold the US then used that price to buy gold from people and then backed the dollar with gold and even made owning it illegal alsoone of those two men who tried cornering the market was the Presidents brother in law so it was clearly a setup and a lot of people lost money but the US gained a lot of gold at cheaper prices right before switching the currency to be backed by gold So it was all about currency So why is the same thing happening again? August was the 50th year anniversary of Nixon ending the gold backed dollar in the 70s and starting the petro backed dollar So what does the end of the currency look like? Remember I said there was a crash for gold because the US released all its stores and crashed the market? Well guess [who owns the most bitcoin](https://wwwwiredcom/2013/12/fbi-wallet/)? Well for starters everyone will need a personal wallet (hence a vaccine passport for tracking is going to come sooner or later but this is the best excuse) The current chair of the SEC (Gary Gensler) who was installed in April taught a class about crypto currency at MIT Sloane (which is an enlightening resource if you want to see how officials view crypto currencies) He even talks about bitcoin finishing a 10 year testing phase and how it survived {what does that even mean? I thought Satoshi Nakamoto was an anonymous person I thought crypto was all about a decentralized financial platform and yet the current head of the SEC says it survived a testing phase?} So what else do we know signifies the end of the petro dollar? Weve all seen how much climate change pops up Well plastics are part of the oil system and thats part of the end too is my guess I know people think its an environmental factor for climate change but we all know that the biggest changes arent happening (a very tiny percentage accounts for the most pollutants but nothing is done about those) But following the money its clear that climate change is a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue This is extremely clear because two separate Senate and house committees met with banks in May about climate changewhy would they meet with banks instead of oil companies or manufacturers? Again the evidence points to a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue But theyre pushing us simply to change what system we consume while avoiding the largest climate change pollutants And even ending the oil system next is energy sourcingwell enter in Afghanistan popping up again and the Taliban/ISIS (which is where the largest lithium deposit is) But the key point is that we will move off of seaparate working grids (because even if you steal gasoline it still works on your vehicle) onto one grid that uses unique identification (which electrical vehicles already do but again is part of the movement away from the machine driven system and into the computer/tracking system) And what about the old infrastructure? Have you noticed how all those hacking attacks kept happening to old infrastructure key points? And the hackers keep asking other countries for huge amount of bitcoin? Have you noticed how war keeps popping up involving all those countries on the old system? Must be a complete coincidence Im sure But well know for sure this is the case if the market crashes soon Hyperinflation is close and technically happening but the FED refuses to acknowledge it (crazy how we dont vote for the FED president and yet they control the entire economy) Weve now had the largest 12 month increase in inflation since 1983 The CPI has changed over and over how inflation is measured true inflation is estimated anywhere from 13% - 25% (but you already know that and likely got your rent hiked already up 20% year-over-year) Thats what happened in the 30s right as they switched to a new backing for the dollar (with Gold) and were seeing all the signs present now that this is true If were about to end the machine driven age and start the computer driven stage then we would each need a unique wallet address and a passport can accompany that It would be the easiest way to install worldwide tracking (since crypto provides a ledger for everything) Also well know bitcoin prices will shoot through the roof after a crash if all this is true and happens Either way this ties corona (an excuse for mass printing of money) the vaccine (more money and a unique wallet tied to ID) end of petro dollar and machine age (climate change is a financial issue disguised as an environmental issue end of plastics from oil) end of the retail to stores system and move to full digital marketplace the beginning of the crypto dollar and crashing the crypto markets (already happened but still can drop much farther along with the rest of the market similar to exact same scenarios in the past) Were entering into the most tracked age of all time everything on the planet will be tracked back to unique ids and monitored on a blockchain/verified by a computer "The Great Reset" might sound like a conspiracy meme but thats an awful lot of coordination to happen in a short period of time Even better since I wrote this the IMF and 10 countries got together in Israel and [Simulated a Cyber Attack that would shut down the Global Financial System](https://financeyahoocom/news/exclusive-imf-10-countries-simulate-133015124html) Im sure thats just a coincidence too! Im sure once it happens everyone will be shocked and demand answersthat they already have Its coming my guess is at the start of Bidens second term since thats when they did it with Nixon Ill keep writing this and if Im wrong I will stop but weve been checking off each point from that paper by Blackrock ever since corona started Every company put money back into their company and was given a massive amount with the PPP loans and every country matched financial and monetary policies and was given massive amounts of money during corona Soif the market started showing signs of a massive failure in 2019 and this paper was put out in August 2019 and weve followed every item line by line of this outline since then and it came before coronathen what does that say about corona This was the single largest robbery in history and unless you are in the 1% then you are going to be the one paying for it You paid for it not just with two full years of your life hearing about this you didnt just pay by having communities torn apart or having to hear people argue about things that arent the actual problem you didnt just pay for it by having to actually stay in solitary confinement that includes the ability to watch your phone and the internetyou literally are going to actually pay for the rest of your life with the inflation costs and debt Well see if this is rightbut weve already checked off most the points from that paper The rich got so insanely rich since this happened It was literally the best year for Wall Street but how was it for most people?,garthsworld,16474938020,2

h1tkxz7,nzya2n,I have serious doubts that this guy was pulling the trigger Ive watched several videos of people claiming the shots were coming from multiple directions from above And for some reason I cant find body cam footage of the actual breech showing Paddock already dead I mean really they cant use "due to the graphic nature we will not release it" as an excuse considering they have no problem releasing some pretty gruesome footage if it suits their story Additionally in any of the footage I have found that was shortly after said breech I cant see a shattered window in any of them most curtains are drawn and not a breeze flowing at all If you have any definitive footage I would really appreciate it But as of now I think this was staged and Paddock was the fall guy Anyways I think you have done some fantastic work and will be going through the video archive What would be cool is a reenactment based on the data portraying his position in the hotel to where shots were fired and where people were wounded / killed at specific intervals Apparently he also paused to shoot through the hotel room door when an employee was standing outside the doorSeems odd that in the middle of a shooting spree hes also monitoring camera footage outside his hotel roomNow would have to image that hes got a surveillance system set up and within view while hes firing into a crowdWheres the footage showing this surveillance tech? Lots of holes or at least unanswered questions Also I read that he allegedly had child porn on his computer Perhaps the motive to at least make him the scapegoat under threat of being exposed?,fortmacjack99,16237382040,7

gwe22ao,n13x8h,Law enforcement in itself is not about justice Theyre order-followers And order-followers do as theyre told with no thought of their own about whether its right or wrong - for a paycheck Once you understand who is *really* giving the orders the Epstein situation makes perfect sense Heres a clue: Notice the black & white chess-board symbolism police wear around their heads? The occult meaning for that: Not knowing the difference between right & wrong Police officers owners and they *do* have owners put that symbolism there intentionally as a form of mockery They put it directly around police officers brains Their owners laugh hysterically about this behind closed doors The problem is those who work in law enforcement have confused man-made law with actual justice (Natural Law) They dont see the difference - and there is an *enormous* difference They need an understanding of Natural Law and there is a lot of effort put forth to hide knowledge of Natural Law from the public Natural Law is logic-based and contains absolute truths about morality Man-made laws on the other hand involve people writing down that they have "authority" over others and then mind-controlling the public into believing that makes that authority real Of course it doesnt in reality But the reason things like Epsteins death are allowed to happen is because the people working in law enforcement simply do as theyre told by their higher-ups regardless of whether its actually right or wrong No real improvement will occur for humanity in terms of all these conspiracies until far more people begin understanding Natural Law and applying it to their actions instead of believing in the supposed "authority" of government Thats the root of the problem for *all* conspiracies - and the solution We are quickly running out of time to do this And the vast majority of people believe in the legitimacy of the authority of government right now That needs to change Were nowhere near where we need to be with not much time left Anyone reading this please help spread the word about Natural Law Look into it for yourself if you dont know about it,Law_of_1,16197586280,3

I get so frustrated seeing people so politically divided everywhere even here When are people going to realize its not really about left or right Its about the working class vs the elites Politicians on both sides are corrupt elitist bastards who absolutely do not care about the average man or his needs They do not plan on doing anything except sticking to the status quo and then whispering in your ear that its not their fault things havent changed Its the other sides fault They benefit when were distracted by identity politics and war among ourselves They want us too busy fighting with each other to pay attention to them The more we let left/right or black/white divide us the better off they are,vannah12222,16436479110,8
hv0rwi9,sh2zq9,Well said OP Your wider point is spot on as well as your point about book burning and this sub Remember this and only this people Conservatives and the right wing has nothing to offer you If youre part of the 1% and can benefit from Reaganomics and top earner tax cuts then great youre insulated from the system But the average working guy? Or even a middle class family The conservatives have nothing to offer you to make your life better At all So they co-opt endless culture wars and conspiracies and when one has spent enough political capital and is dry they move on to the next one Drag Queens gay marriage CRT Mr Potato head and so on Republicans and right wingers offer nothing to improve your life at all Stock market?

hv1ifjq,sh2zq9,So what i see are comments like "this sub is a far right echo camber" which gets heavily upvoted which contradicts that claim No nuance when it comes to "bans" some are just not mandetory readed while others get removed from libary Reinforing the "its all antivaxx now" when the term antivaxx is a propaganda term pushed by corperate media Everyone long enough in this sub has seen the massive corruption and change of narratives and the narrative control around this vaccines Republicans will not be the solution even if they now push hard that they are the party of freedom I think the left made a big mistake letting all critique on bigpharma for the right the right will probably get the majority in the upcoming years simply for this But also because they stand against the woke agenda They use a few videos of woke teachers to portrai that most teachers are like this (And please dont defend the woke agenda its a rascist and sexist worldview and keeps the worklingclass divided) The best explanation i read is that everything that happens now is the beginning of the end of the us empire Massive focus on identity gender race rejection of any traditional moral views the massive problems with the currency All this happened to previous empires before their fall But its a long process it can easily go for 50years,nelbar,16436617050,8

hv0k8tc,sh2zq9,I had this conversation/discussion a few weeks back I asked the question of how is it allowable that a public library or a public school could ban books? They are arms of the state and therefor the first amendment applies to them It should be grossly unconstitutional for them to be allowed to ban *any* books I was met with "well you dont want a fourth grader reading 50 shades right? Some books are inappropriate" And yes I agree some books are inappropriate Except that I believe if a teacher can turn a book into a learning experience why should we just ban that book?

Is detention inprisionment? If folks wanted to load up school libraries with Nazi propaganda can they? Would Democrats be "burning books" if they removed them? This post sounds partisan It sounds like "my tyranny is better than the conservatives tyranny" You need to remember what a school is It is not an enlightened public square of freedom where anything goes It is a state institution that looks similar to prisons with strict guidelines to make kids obedient It is designed to be propaganda camp and train kids to work for a corporation or big gov until death As long as schools are this big tyrannical force i dont see how changing the type of propaganda will make much of a difference Counter culture IS the culture,zuko7891,16436635830,1

I think thats a pretty decent probability in my opinion but Im just throwing it out there as food for thought Not a counter point per se but I think were doing ourselves a disservice if we dont consider some different possibilities with this situation And given the possible manufactured nature of Epsteins persona (nobody knows where he got his money seems to just show up in power circles is handled by law enforcement as an intelligence asset and is disappeared/murdered when captured to name a few) Ive caught myself wondering if Epstein himself was not a propped up ready to go expendable patsy I could even see a scenario where he may have thought he was setting up pedophiles like working for law enforcement Just to be clear Im NOT saying I believe that Im just saying there seems to be a lot more nuance to this situation than a lot of people want to acknowledge That is all I believe in casting a wide net and working from that Nothing more nothing less I think it helps That certainly would not make him a good guy (just to be clear again lol) but when you think of this case that way it opens up some interesting possibilities To believe that Epstein was the pinnacle here (in any way) is to take our eyes off the ball This guy was working for some entity My point in saying this is Epstein most definitely could be just a prop and always a cut out to take the fall that is a well known practice for these types I think there is just as much to indicate that Maxwell was the one in charge as there ever was that Epstein was the head of this Or it could go much deeper than that (very likely IMO) Thanks again for posting OP And take all of what Ive typed here with a spirit of being helpful because that is how it is meant,Flop_McKochen,16381184880,95

hmf92b3,r45a5n,So I presume everyone who hangs out in a place like this understands *what* exactly Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeff Epstein *were* They were spies working for a foreign nation who utilized child sex slaves as one means of extortion and control over their targets Their targets included at least one US administration which they successfully controlled They also included field-leading scientists in areas ranging from genetics through cryptography media social media all the way to orbital launch and space flight In the world of espionage there are assets agents who develop the assets case officers who develop and manage the agents and powers that tell the case officers what to do Layers of separation meant to keep the hands of the shot-callers clean Epstein was an asset; Maxwell was an agent Both quite obviously worked for Mossad The Maxwell-Epstein team even targeted Elon Musk though apparently unsuccessfully much like the Bronfman-sponsored NXIVM mind control/sex traffic cult team successfully targeted Richard Branson of Virgin fame even celebrating their capture by holding parties on Bransons private island [They had predecessors](https://iimgurcom/gH04jObjpg) who controlled previous US administrations through similar means The existence of such creatures across the breadth of US history suggests that there are most likely teams doing similar things currently in operation One such team recently targeted congressman Matt Gaetz; their operation was disrupted and two members of their team are already in federal custody The rest are known Now you must understand something else While Ghislaine Maxwells cell of this team has been deactivated there are remnant cells in the form of Maxwells sisters who wrote much of the code the US government uses at a federal level to track the movements of people keep out terrorists and keep the borders of America secure This granted the Maxwell team the ability to traffic in humans in undetectable fashion around the world as well as facilitate the completely clandestine movements of VIPs around the world In short not the kind of people you want in charge of your fundamental natsec backbone software Now you understand why Maxwell had a pilots and a submariners license Now you understand why Nadia Marcinkova another member of the Maxwell-Epstein team remains a pilot and remains at large Now you understand why all the other members of the Maxwell-Epstein team are still at large: theyre completely in charge of your government those higher powers that tell the cells what to do and whom to target Woodrow Wilson had a relevant quote about these hidden powers,KorvaxNaniteJelly,16381213780,66

h6bceli,oq0kxg,For those that complain of capitalism or communism or what not the real issue is the kid raising system Lets pretend you want to be a millionaire by 30 In a college system with $100k of debt starting at 22 you basically need to earn around $150k per year after taxes and expenses to get to $1 Mil by 30 if investments go well etc (about doubling) Now remove college all together Instead of $150k you need like $90k Now imagine you take a kid and instead of the asinine question what do you want to do (all girls : animals community kids environment all boys : outdoor guy what my dad did) - and instead say what do you want to have This is what I do They always want a nice car vs shit car They want a happy spouse with kids vs alone and desperate They want to be able to afford medicines vs bothering family with a go fund me Its a relatively easy decision; lots of money better There are actually a LOT of careers that pay $90k without a degree Now if you plan for this you get them as an apprentice BUT ONLY for careers that pay $60k base and $200k tops like computers legal finance media & medical I had a dancing girlfriend that became a doctor simply by working at Walgreens She of course had no concept of what being a doctor was but after the pharmacist kept giving her money driving a nice car and invited her to her nice house - boom she became a doctor (internally) It was easy But more to the point I got this trailer kid that I sponsored over a few years who will be making $60k at 18 in computers - all I had to do was pay him $100 or so at a time for computer work here and there roughly what I would have paid someone else He *might* be a millionaire by 30 working full time in computers at 18 with what is normally referred to as the best resume theyve seen - and thats even when he slacked off (his dad gets him drunk weekly and his aunt keeps telling him to spend the next several years getting high and going to music shows thats what life is about!) - I did help him start his own business but he never did the professional networking meetings I suggested And the Key to all this? Benjamin Franklins Autobiography!!! Seriously!!! In it is a quick self study guide (13 virtues) to teach you to not be a dick Then there is the Junto system to make you network and listen to others and learn from them share with them in a constructive way And the final piece of the Benjamin Franklin system was to teach kids (nephews in his day) your skills when they were about 15 Then invest in them enough to start a shop (like $20K say) Then they pay you 50% of profits the next several years In Franklins system he went from poor as fuck to worker (18) - $30k (in todays money) - to extremely good worker living healthy connected and disciplined - shop manager (21) $60k - But the kicker at 32 he invested in 3 nephews basically This is where he made all his money Those nephews were also printers like him By 37 he was retired - and most of his inventions & political involvement happened after 37 (1740) And it was Franklin *the most* responsible for the AM Revolution cause he taught people how to make a fuck ton of money basically (and not to be assholes - EI self governing) Meh dribble but if you do something similar to what the Swiss do today where the average professional salary *is actually* $200000 then ALL of economics solves itself But they force kids into smart apprenticeship programs at 15 Thats the biggest difference The good kids are in professional clubs by 17 This is 100% normal Making $60k out of a Swiss high school is absolutely the norm and the reason the main reason they have such immense wealth Literally every nation could copy this approach and not take away from anyone else but we dont for whatever reason but you should do so with your kids always,Bitcoin1776,16270878610,1

I really do not remember in any history of a war undertaken with such combined injustice and baseness Ordinary wars of conquest are to me far less wicked than to go to war in order to maintain smuggling and that smuggling consisting in the introduction of a demoralizing drug which the government of China wishes to keep out and which we for the lucre of gain want to introduce by force; and in this quarrel are going to burn and slay in the pride of our supposed superiority  Thomas Arnold to W W Hull March 18 1840 http://wwwvictorianweborg/history/empire/opiumwars/opiumwars1html 3 https://webarchiveorg/web/20180311121505/https://sacuorg/opium2html See also Opium in China In 1997 the colony of Hong Kong was returned to China Hong Kong Island became a British possession as a direct result of the Opium War the opening shots of which were fired 150 years ago All Chinese regardless of political ideology have condemned this armed confrontation as an unjust and immoral contest As far as they are concerned Britians waging a war for the sake of selling a poisonous drug constitutes the most shameful leaf of human history In the hindsight provided by subsequent events in China it is perhaps easy to condemn this act of British aggression but it is less certain that the event was seen in the same condemnatory light by Chinese and foreign observers a century and a half ago 4 Article on opium trade in 1920s Shanghai http://streetsofshanghaipbworkscom/w/page/18638691/Opium Opium (yapian ) Shanghai was built on the opium trade Before the 1850s Shanghai was the terminal port for coastal opium traffic Shanghai was opened to foreign trade on November 11th 1843 and very soon afterwards Jardines (the biggest British company in China at the time) set up a branch there and hired Chinese compradors one of whom was solely concerned with the supervision of opium By 1845 the opium moving through Shanghai constituted almost half of all the opium imported into China In 1880 nearly 13000000 pounds of opium came into China mainly from India By 1900 imports declined because China was now producing an average of 45000000 pounds of opium per annum itself There were at least 15000000 Chinese opium addicts  in Chengdu there was one opium den for every 67 inhabitants of the city In Shanghai some foreign missionaries began to complain that their homes were almost entirely surrounded by opium dens behind bamboo fences The city had more than eighty shops where the drug was sold openly in its crude form and there were over 1500 opium housesThe owners of these establishments bought their supplies from three major opium firms in the International Settlement  the Zhengxia Guoyu and Liwei All three were owned by Swatow (Chaozhou) merchants who formed a consortium This consortium obtained its opium from four foreign merchant houses: David Sassoon & Co ED Sassoon SJ David and Edward Ezra 5 Opium financed British rule in India http://newsbbccouk/2/hi/south\_asia/7460682stm What did you discover in the course of your research? How big was the trade? Opium steadily accounted for about 17-20% of Indian revenues If you think in those terms \[the fact that\] one single commodity accounted for such an enormous part of your economy is unbelievable extraordinary How and when did opium exports out of India to China begin? The idea of exporting opium to China started with Warren Hastings (the first governor general of British India) in 1780 The situation was eerily similar to \[what is happening\] today There was a huge balance of payments problem in relation to China China was exporting enormous amounts but wasnt interested in importing any European goods That was when Hastings came up with idea that the only way of balancing trade was to export opium to China,shylock92008,16270047200,2
h67hnxn,opbmcz,IS ANYONE APOLOGIZING TO GARY WEBB? by Michael Levine (DEA-RET) Gary Webb just in case youve already forgotten him was the journalist who in a well researched understated article entitled "The Dark Alliance" linked the CIA supported Contras to cocaine and weapons being sold to a California street gang and ended up literally being hounded out of journalism by every mainstream news peddling organization in the Yellow Pages Even his own employer The San Jose Mercury piled on for the kill And guess what? The CIA finally admitted yesterday in the New York Times no less that they in fact did "work with" the Nicaraguan Contras while they had information that they were involved in cocaine trafficking to the United States An action known to us court qualified experts and federal agents as Conspiracy to Import and Distribute Cocainea federal felony punishable by up to life in prison To illustrate how us regular walking around non CIA types are treated when we violate this law while I was serving as a DEA supervisor in New York City I put two New York City police officers in a federal prison for Conspiracy to distribute Cocaine when they looked the other way at their friends drug dealing We could not prove they earned a nickel nor that they helped their friend in any way they merely did not do their duty by reporting him They were sentenced to 10 and 12 years respectively and one of them I was recently told had committed suicide I have spent three decades as a court qualified expert and federal agent and am not aware of any class of American Citizen having special permission to violate the law that we have been taxed over $1 trillion in the past two decades to enforce; the law that every politician bureaucrat and media pundit keeps telling us protects us against the most serious danger to American security in our historyThe interesting thing to me about the Webb article is that the CIA is provably (and now admittedly) responsible for much larger scale drug trafficking than Webb alleged or even imagined in his report In fact according to a confidential DEA report entitled "Operation Hun a Chronology" that I used as part of the proof to back up the undercover experiences detailed in my book The Big White Lie (optioned for a movie by Robert Greenwald Productions) the CIA was actively blocking DEA from indicting many members of the ruling government of Bolivia from 1980-83during a time period that these same people were responsible for producing more than 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States As CIA Inspector General Hitz himself stated before congress it was during this time period that Nicaraguan Contra supporters were buying large amounts of cocaine from these same CIA protected Bolivians Do you think Congress wants to see this proof? The gang that cant spy straight as they are known to my listeners and about whom President Lyndon Johnson once said "When Rich folks dont trust their sons with the family money they send them on down to the CIA" certainly did a lot more damage to this nation than for example computer company owner Will Foster who was sentenced to 93 years in prison for possession of 70 marijuana plants for medicinal use Of course true to their shifty sleazy form while admitting that they did aid and abet Contra drug trafficking they are now refusing to release their own final investigative report which details the damning proof The same report that CIA Inspector General Fredrick Hitz during February 1998 had promised congress and the American people was forthcoming "shortly" because as CIA Director George Tenet now claims CIA does not have enough money in its budget to properly classify it You believe that then I know an old guy with a beard named Fidel wandering the streets of South Miami with an Island about 90 miles off the coast for sale He says the money is for his retirement How you ask do they get away with it? Well for one thing mainstream media the so-called Fourth Estate does all it can to help During the Iran-contra hearings when Senators Kerry and Damato were making pronouncements before the Senate indicating that the CIA was involved with drug trafficking Katherine Graham the owner of The Washington Post addressed a class of CIA recruits at CIAs Langley headquarters in November 1988 by saying: "There are some things the general public does not need to know and shouldnt I believe democracy flourishes when the government can take legitimate steps to keep its secrets and when the press can decide whether to print what it knows" Apparently CIA protection of drug trafficking was among those secrets Thus it should have been no surprise to those CIA agent recruits when Washington Post reporter and drug expert Michael Itsikoff wrote that there was "no credible evidence" linking the CIA supported contras to cocaine trafficking at the same time very credible evidence was being heard by Senator Kerrys committee indicating that the Contras may have been the top purveyors of drugs to Americans in our historyNeither should it have been a surprise to anyone who heard her statement when mainstream media refused to print the news that Oliver North US Ambassador to Costa Rica Lewis Tambs and various top level CIA officers were banned from ever entering Costa Rica by Nobel Prize winning President Oscar Arias for drug running The drugs by the way all going to us Nor should it have been a surprise when Gary Webb was destroyed by mainstream media for doing nothing more or less than telling the truth as he found it And now while CIA admits their felonies to the press but refuses to release the proof and Janet Reno the head of the Obstruction of Justice Department has done the unprecedented by classifying her own departments investigation into CIA drug trafficking the partnership for a Drug Free America is spending $2 billion of our tax money on already-proven-fruitless anti-drug ads And where do you think the money goes? Answer: to every major media corporation on the big board Gary Webb my friend you are owed a huge apology But I doubt that youll get it Not in this lifetime,shylock92008,16270105150,2

h674p5o,opbmcz,1998: CIA Says It Used Nicaraguan Rebels Accused of Drug Tie; By James Risen July 17 1998 ; "The agencys decision to keep those paid agents or to continue dealing with them in some less formal relationship was made by top officials at headquarters in Langley Va" - NYT  https://wwwnytimescom/1998/07/17/world/cia-says-it-used-nicaraguan-rebels-accused-of-drug-tiehtml CIA Says It Used Nicaraguan Rebels Accused of Drug Tie By James Risen July 17 1998 The Central Intelligence Agency continued to work with about two dozen Nicaraguan rebels and their supporters during the 1980s despite allegations that they were trafficking in drugs according to a classified study by the CIA The new study has found that the agencys decision to keep those paid agents or to continue dealing with them in some less formal relationship was made by top officials at headquarters in Langley Va in the midst of the war waged by the CIA-backed contras against Nicaraguas leftist Sandinista Government The new report by the CIAs inspector general criticizes agency officials actions at the time for the inconsistent and sometimes sloppy manner in which they investigated -- or chose not to investigate -- the allegations which were never substantiated by the agency The inspector generals report which has not yet been publicly released also concludes that there is no evidence that any CIA officials were involved in drug trafficking with contra figures The fundamental finding of the report is that there is no information that the CIA or CIA employees ever conspired with any contra organizations or individuals involved with the contras for purposes of drug trafficking a United States intelligence official said The new report is the long-delayed second volume of the CIAs internal investigation into possible connections between the contras and Central American drug traffickers The investigation was originally prompted by a 1996 series in The San Jose Mercury-News which asserted that a dark alliance between the CIA the contras and drug traffickers had helped finance the contra war with profits from drug smuggling The second volume dismisses those specific charges as did the first volume released in January The series charged that the alliance created a drug trafficking network that introduced crack cocaine into South Central Los Angeles It prompted an enormous outcry especially among blacks many of whom said they saw it as confirmation of a Government-backed conspiracy to keep blacks dependent and impoverished The Mercury-News subsequently admitted that the series was flawed and reassigned the reporter In the declassified version of the CIAs first volume the agency said the Mercury-News charges were baseless and mentioned drug dealers who had nothing to do with the CIA But John M Deutch the Director of Central Intelligence at the time had also asked the inspector general to conduct a broader inquiry to answer unresolved questions about the contra program and drug trafficking that had not been raised by The Mercury-News Frederick Hitz then the CIAs inspector general decided to issue a second larger report to deal with those broader issues Many allegations in the second volume track closely with charges that first surfaced in a 1987 Senate investigation The CIA is reluctant to release the complete 500-page second volume because it deals directly with contras the agency did work with According to the report CIA officials involved in the contra program were so focused on the fight against the Sandinistas that they gave relatively low priority to collecting information about the possible drug involvement of contra rebels The report concluded that CIA officers did report on drug trafficking by the contras but that there were no clear guidelines given to field officers about how intensively they should investigate or act upon the allegations In all the CIA received allegations of drug involvement against about 50 contras or supporters during the war against the Sandinistas the report said Some of the allegations may have been specious the result of Sandinista propaganda American intelligence officials said It could not be determined from the CIAs records how many of the 50 cases were fully investigated But the agency continued to work with about two dozen of the 50 contras according to American intelligence officials familiar with the report They said the report had found that the agency was unable to either prove or disprove the charges or did not investigate them adequately American intelligence officials who provided information about the report declined to identify the individual contras who were the subjects of the drug allegations But they did say that in addition to individual cases the report found that drug allegations had been made against one contra organization a group known as 15th of September That group was formed in 1980 and was disbanded in January 1982 The CIAs decision to classify this second volume has already been met with criticism in Congress Senator John Kerry Democrat of Massachusetts who led a 1987 Congressional inquiry into allegations of contra drug connections wrote a letter Thursday to the Director of Central Intelligence George J Tenet asking that the report be immediately declassified Mr Kerry who has reviewed the second volume of the inspector generals report said he believed that CIA officials involved in the contra program did not make a serious effort to fully investigate the allegations of drug involvement by the contras Some of us in Congress at the time in 1985 1986 were calling for a serious investigation of the charges and CIA officials did not join in that effort Mr Kerry said There was a significant amount of stonewalling Im afraid that what I read in the report documents the degree to which there was a lack of interest in making sure the laws were being upheld A version of this article appears in print on July 17 1998 Section A Page 2 of the National edition

h67hc60,opbmcz,[https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/](https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/) CIA ADMITS TO DEAL WITH JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO OBSTRUCT JUSTICE Michael Levine & Laura Kavanau-Levine THE EXPERT WITNESS radio show March 24 1998 As an ex DEA agent I found the complete lack of coverage by mainstream media of what I saw last night during the congressional hearings into CIA Drug Trafficking on CNN both depressing and frightening I sat gape-mouthed as I heard the CIA Inspector General testify that there has existed a secret agreement between CIA and the Justice Department wherein "during the years 1982 to 1995 CIA did not have to report the drug trafficking its assets did to the Justice Department" (This is the agreement by the way that lead directly to events described in our non-fiction books The Big White Lie and Deep Cover Those many who have read the books will know instantly what I am talking about) To a trained DEA agent this literally means that the CIA had been granted a license to obstruct justice in our so-called war on drugs; a license that lasted-so CIA claims-from 1982 to 1995 a time during which Americans paid almost $150 billion in taxes to "fight" drugs Of course the evidence indicates that they did not stop obstructing justice in 1995 either but that I suppose is going to be another congressional hearing As far as the current hearings go this Catch 22 "revelation" means that all the present hearings are for nothing; that-if they are caught violating the drug laws-they had been given "secret" license to do so by our Justice Department This might also explain Janet Renos recent and unprecedented move in blocking the release of a Justice Department investigation into CIA drug trafficking God with friends like these who needs enemies? I t is now clear that this agreement began with the events described in THE BIG WHITE LIE; that the top drug traffickers in Bolivia then supplying virtually all the worlds cocaine-including Sonia Atala-were CIA assets that had to be protected from our deep cover probe Laura and I still have the proof of this that we used to back up the publication THE BIG WHITE LIE The same proof was later incorporated into other data backing up the publications of DEEP COVER and TRIANGLE OF DEATH [https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/](https://consortiumnewscom/2013/06/06/hitlers-shadow-reaches-toward-today/) Our evidence-which congress has been craning its neck not to see- for instance shows clearly that during Operation Hun (the story in The Big White Lie) secret meetings were held with CIA and Justice Department wherein all indictments of top government officials in Bolivia were blocked We now believe this agreement began because of Operation Hun CIA had to hide the fact that they were supporting the people manufacturing virtually all the cocaine being produced in the world at that time In Deep Cover we showed that during Operation Trifecta-a highly successful deep cover probe into the top of the drug world in three countries (Panama Bolivia and Mexico) -Attorney General of the US Ed Meese found it necessary to warn the Attorney General of Mexico about DEAs case We (undercover DEA agents and Customs agents) found links between top US government officials and the people who murdered DEA agent Kiki Camarena that to this day go unexamined by our congress or anyone else In "TRIANGLE OF DEATH a work of "faction" we showed CIAs real-life involvement in the protection and creation of one of the most murderous criminal organizations to ever plague America an organization created by escaped Nazi fugitives under CIA protection-events occurring long before this alleged CIA Justice agreement And so the dance continues If anyone watched the CNN show you cannot have helped but notice the snickering on the part of Congressional chairman Porter Goss (an ex CIA officer) as congresswoman Maxine Waters spoke Now heres the reason why: Sources of mine who speak to me from inside this veil of secrecy out of conscience and because I am cheaper and more reliable than a psychiatrist have already told me the following: There is secret communication between CIA and members of the Congressional staff-one must keep in mind that Porter Goss the chairman is an ex CIA official- indicating that the whole hearing is just a smoke and mirror show so that the American people-particularly the Black community- can "blow off some steam" without doing any damage to CIA The CIA has been assured that nothing real will be done other than some embarrassing questions being asked That the hearings will result in the CIA receiving even a larger budget than the current $26 billion that they admit to One of the most distressing things for me a 25 year veteran of this business to listen to was when Congresswoman Waters said that the hearings were not about CIA officers being indicted and going to jail "That is not going to happen" she said Almost in the same breath she spoke of a recent case in Miami wherein a Venezuelan National Guard general was caught by Customs agents smuggling more than a ton of cocaine into the US Despite named CIA officers being involved in the plot as Congresswoman Waters stated the Justice Department will not tell her anything about the case because of "secrecy laws" No wonder chairman Goss was snickering She could not have played more neatly into CIA hands than to surrender before the battle was engaged For the entire existence of CIA they have gotten away with doing more damage to the American people than all our traditional enemies combined precisely because no one was ever prosecuted From the CIA protection of Nazi criminals from war crimes prosecution as they set up criminal organizations that preyed on America (Triangle of Death) to their lies to President Kennedy that dragged us into Bay of Pigs to their lies to President Johnson that dragged us into the Vietnam War to their creation of a pan Arab army of American hating drug trafficking terrorists during the Afghan War to the Church Commission hearings to MK-Ultra to the Bolivian Cocaine Coup ("The Big White Lie") to their protection of the worlds top cocaine traffickers as they laid waste to American streets (Deep cover) the CIA has acted exactly as Senator Frank Church once described them: "a runaway rogue elephantcompletely unresponsive to Congressthey (the CIA) have not only been unproductive they have been contra productive they have brought great shame on America" And the dance continues &#x200B; &#x200B; https://npredditcom/r/NarcoFootage/comments/nthcsy/dea6\_by\_dea\_hector\_berrellez\_wayne\_schmidt\_opr/ The KIKI Camarena murder was tied to the use of US intelligence using drug cartel ranches for Contra military training AND Contra/DOD/NSC/Oliver North drug smuggling ring at the same time MEREX Corp supplied arms and other items to the cartel/ It was owned by a Ex Nazi CIA agent named Gerhard Mertins the company also employed Klaus Barbie,shylock92008,16270103370,1

hw3jwr9,snj9i6,Careful not to over analyze analogies guys doing so completely misses the purpose of an analogy as an argumentative technique I mentioned this in some comments below but wanted to throw this out there because there seems to be some misunderstandings Analogies are NOT meant to be 1 to 1 comparisons; they are a form of comparison to shed light on a specific aspect of an argument in a different light Attacking an analogy without the context of how they are being used on specifics that arent relevant to the comparison doesnt defeat the analogy it just misses the point being conveyed in the first place The seatbelt analogy is not saying car safety and corona safety are the same thing The analogy is a response to arguments along the lines of "why do I need a mask if Im already vaxxed?" If you ignore this context and just attack the details of why seatbelts arent like masks/vaccines you have missed the point and are instead arguing against a point no one made A better argument would be something like a better analogy or an explanation as to why the analogy doesnt work For example: "seatbelts and airbags are great for a collision but not very helpful when your car gets rammed not lake Omicron" This is an actual argument against the analogy because it conveys the normalcy of overlapping safety measures the original analogy was pointing out is irrelevant when the safety measures are designed to protect against a different harm than what has occurred Dont lost in the weeds like OP about random stuff like how seatbelts dont cause long term health effects (an argument literally no one made thats irrelevant to efficacy of overlapping safety measures aka the point of the analogy) Instead focus on actually refuting point the analogy was making in the first place If you want to successfully attack an analogy you have to stick to the topic actually being analogized Otherwise youre totally missing the point and refuting the wrong argument,Popular_Ad4115,16443374590,1

hw497h0,snj9i6,You seem misinformed on the vaccine in general The reason comparing a seatbelt to the vaccine is an analogy is because its similar in some ways but the two are not exactly same And you must remember the context the seatbelt analogy is often brought up as an answer to "why do I need to wear a mask if I already have a vaccine" the answer of course being that we wear seatbelts as well as airbags because we want to improve our chances of not only not passing it on but also not dying You also seem to think that the risk of blood clots in the vaccine are bad would it surprise you to know that the coronavirus as a much much (x10) higher chance of blood clots "necrological disorders" and all manor of other side effects? You also seem to think theyre are some secret "long term results" were still waiting for but this is a strange thought No vaccine before has ever been present in the body for more than 6 months at the absolute most Vaccines as you know are there to train the immune system and dont stay in the body long usually around a month or less With 2 billion+ doses administered we still have no addition side effects so it seems strange to wait for these Covid on the other hand seems very capable of permanently damaging a lot of lung ear nose and throat systems with long term effects like difficult breathing lung capacity smell and taste and many more just being permanently changed Im not sure what "hiding the safety data" the cdc and all the drug agencies have been very forthcoming on all their trials You all even got mad at the cdc for saying there was no evidence of airborne contagion early on and then changing that stance after they researched it and got evidence Same thing with when they said dont wear masks at first as they were no thought at the time to be necessary but new data came out and the cdc adapted its message to the studies The cdc has been reflective of the data from the begining You might be talking about the preprint studies and the VAERS database stuff Those Im sure you have heard are flawed for many reasons their results may be correct or not but we need more data before we can say anything If the researchers and doctors at the head of the preprints or VAERS claims believed that they would want to wait for these studies But we did this cycle with monocoidal antibodies ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine and each time they put in the work for a big double blind study these drugs are reveal to do nothing or so little as to be nothing You also seem very concerned about the companies themselves but for all your conspiracy you dont look at the positives These companies are looking to make big money from government contracts and to get the biggest ones you need an effective vaccine as verified by the FDA and the 40 other countries the vaccine will go too including France Britain Germany and even our enemies China and Russia It in their best interest to make a working vaccine especially because they must compete in a hot market theyre now like 7 different vaccines from different companies so competition is fierce I mean just ask yourself if the vaccine was truly dangerous why wouldnt Russia or China talk about it Or the hundreds of journalists looking for hot stories or any of our allied countries to alter their friends or peoples or the competing companies after their government contract All these people and more would have to work together its impossible,rascalrhett1,16443466010,-4
hw378p6,snj9i6,This is completely missing the primary point of when most people are bringing up the seatbelt analogy Yes some people bring it up as a pure example of a mandated safety rule But the primary point of the seatbelt analogy is in explaining to people how a vaccine can be working but that the majority of people in some places who are hospitalized are vaccinated Thats because the ratios matter The analogy then is to how seatbelts work to reduce risk in crashes but far more people end up in hospitals from car crashes who were wearing seatbelts than who werent because almost everyone wears a seatbelt The only other context the seatbelts are sometimes used is analogous to masks and then the analogy works pretty well even in the use-case So this primarily seems to be an argument being directed at what is fundamentally a misunderstanding of the main reason seatbelts get mentioned,JoshuaZ1,16443325170,-7

hrd6x4k,rwkj3w,My aunts and I had such a great time in DC in 2019 as it was our first time visiting and we liked it so much that we said we would go back this year Cue a few weeks ago the DC mayor implemented that damn vaccine mandate where you have two have two doses of it in order to enter indoor venues This completely shit on my trip and I either have to get fully vaccinated before March 8th since my trip is at the end of that month or not go There is the option of going but not going anywhere indoors but then Id be the odd woman out This shit is STUPID!

hrfghyd,rwkj3w,The worst is yet to come My religion (Orthodox) had prophecies about this and so far around 8-9 of them came true (theres more but they are some smaller ones so I wouldnt mention them) The one that is yet to come true is the one saying "once the humanity is at the point of not knowing what to do as times are getting worse and no solutions are to be found antichrist will appear with a solution" (I tried to translate it as best as I could) Vaccines are proving as failing which is exactly what they want The time will come when they will say publicly that they no longer know what to do and how to deal with the pandemic Thats when a *certain person* will appear with a "solution" to end all problems and he will be throned in UN as the humanitys saviour I made this as brief as I could as it is rather complex and in order to truly understand and believe all this youd need to know a lot of backstory Another huge one said that "there will be a global pandemic before the end" (This one was told about 200-300 years ago iirc) We live in the end times sadly You may or may not believe me but Ive been following advices that my religion told me due to these prophecies and I havent regretted a single decision I made thus far Ive simply been following prophecies and what they tell us to do and Im making it work Havent and wont take the vax as I know what it is leading towards,HRCK0,16414291920,2

Now 1 month later they send her another threat and it is obvious that they didnt even READ her justification and are now only accepting an excuse directly from a doctor! They are also ONLY listing allergies to the vaccine as a medical excuse I know she is scared to death Ive heard her balling her eyes out asking her superiors at the company to speak up for her and advocate They are all too afraid to be viewed as "antivaxxer" themselves and have done nothing to help her so far Dont want to piss off daddy tech These superiors also had NO IDEA that this mandate was even in place at the company They knew nothing about these threats being sent to unvaccinated workers She is the top performer in her team This is the best job she has ever had by far and she is scared to death of losing it To the point where she is now thinking of getting the vaccine even though she knows it is highly risky for her health in particular! She has done everything right to justify not getting the vaccine and they are completely ignoring her! If anyone in the US knows of any recourse we could take against this measure please tell me! I know that this is illegal and the courts will MAYBE eventually side with basic fucking ethics but she cant wait for that At the end of this month she will be vaccinated or unemployed all so she can continue working from home around nobody else Again if anyone has advice please give itand keep in mind the company is stonewalling her and not even answering her questions,billyjk93,16414124040,1

hmje0na,r4vfd2,**OP is wrong** All of the fault for what happened the night Epstein died and what happened to the video belongs to the Metropolitan Correctional Center which is managed by the Bureau of Prisons The prosecutors in the Southern District of New York do not have any supervision over the jail https://lawandcrimecom/awkward/government-reverses-course-jeffrey-epstein-suicide-attempt-video-no-longer-exists/ > The Government respectfully submits this letter to provide a further update to the Court regarding the defenses request for video footage from outside the defendants cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC") on July 22  July 23 2019 On or about December 19 2019 the Government informed the Court and defense counsel that it had confirmed with MCC staff that the requested video had been preserved and that the Government was working to obtain a copy from MCC As set forth in greater detail below the Government has learned that the MCC inadvertently preserved video from the wrong tier within the MCC and as a result video from outside the defendants cell on July 22  23 2019 (ie the requested video) no longer exists > On or about July 23 2019 at approximately 1:27 am MCC corrections officers responded to the cell ("Cell-1") that the defendant shared with Jeffrey Epstein On or about July 25 2019 defense counsel requested that MCC preserve video footage from outside the defendants cell from July 22 2019 at 11:00 pm through July 23 2019 at 4:00 am From speaking with MCC legal counsel the Government understands that in response to this request MCC legal counsel looked up the defendants cell number in the MCC computer system and thereafter requested that MCC staff preserve video from outside of that cell for the requested time period An MCC staff member confirmed that the video had been preserved > On or about January 3 2020 the MCC provided the Government with a copy of the video that it had preserved which the Government then converted into a playable format After reviewing the video it appeared to the Government that the footage contained on the preserved video was for the correct date and time but captured a different tier than the one where Cell-1 was located because the preserved video did not show corrections officers responding to any of the cells seen on the video After speaking with MCC legal counsel the Government was informed that the MCC computer system listed a different incorrect cell for Tartaglione ("Cell-2") Therefore when MCC legal counsel asked that the video outside of the defendants cell be preserved the MCC preserved video outside of Cell-2 instead of Cell-1 > The Government understands from speaking with MCC legal counsel that there was a backup system in place that housed all video for the Special Housing Unit including the video requested by defense counsel The Government further understands from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that it has reviewed that backup system as part of an unrelated investigation and determined that the requested video no longer exists on the backup system and has not since at least August 2019 as a result of technical errors >The Government will make the video of the tier containing Cell-2 available for defense counsels review at the United States Attorneys Office There is no suggestion that the prosecutors did anything wrong,ShaniquaSoros,16381987480,155

I doubt it When I show something my time of day I want it to work I dont wanna have to worry about my Xbox getting red rings I dont wanna have to worry about my new phone blowing up in my pocket when Im driving my new car back to the dealership bcuz it has a WARRANTY bcuz when I bought it they warned me it could break I dont wanna get sick even though I had 2 rounds of vaccines and I want someone to be held responsible if something does happen to me Im not into reincarnation so my life dosnt have a warranty Keep that shit to yourself and give it to your kids until it is FDA approved and the science is confident that it can battle other variants better than it does at the moment,versace8balls,16278361310,1

h7cho06,ovpxdj,According to the research being done especially in places like Israel that has a population over 60 at 80% vaccinated by February data is showing the vaccine effectiveness is fading quick and dramatically Had you been vaccinated in January such as myself youll find youre at best walking around with an effectiveness of nearly 20% compared to someone vaccinated in June who is around 80% If unvaccinated people are the only ones getting sick the concern we are seeing wouldnt be there You would be protected with your vaccination and would have little to worry about The truth is we will see more variants and until we have boosters available and ones that can be made quickly before the new variants take hold we will continue to see spikes regardless of previous vaccinations Instead we are seeing vaccinated people spreading the virus and some knowingly I know first hand someone who is currently infected after being vaccinated in april and she continues to work at her job since the symptoms arent bad according to her and she is vaccinated The anti vaxxers are a problem but theyre a distraction from the real issue that your vaccine will only provide so much protection and its not a ticket to do whatever you want If the vaccine worked effectively for the current delta variant they would only be their own problem Kind of like driving a car with a seatbelt The direct impact is only to the individual I have and still continue to wear two masks including an n95 as well as limit my public interactions It isnt hard to wear a mask its not hard to use common sense even if youre vaccinated Weve had a hospital in my metropolitan area that had 20% of the admitted covid patients fully vaccinated It all depends on when your state started doing vaccines and how long ago it had been since you got yours And we will see a lot more of these so called "breakthrough" cases regardless of vaccination rates And government officials have been warned already of this and the CDC has discussed this internally and a lot of people are concerned about the effectiveness of the vaccines The mask mandate should have never been removed and local governments have also failed their constituents,mrnight8,16278464230,1

ha2l9i4,pa00vu,So now that the FDA approved the vaccine does that mean that people will be forced to get one in order to go into public places? Or is it just work places that will mandate it do you think?

ha25hfj,pa00vu,Im still a little confused on how approvals work between different vaccines If Pfizer is the only one fully approved and this means that companies governments etc can mandate it with little to no legal recourse what does that mean for people who got Moderna/J&J? Will these companies/governments be mandating Pfizer vaccines only? I guess this isnt really that big of an issue if Moderna is probably getting full approval soon but still curious,str1kebeam,16297415590,1

ha5r6k9,pa00vu,Ok so I have a question because I cant seem to find the answer myself from searching so the next logical thing is to ask people smarter than me on Reddit I am vaccinated and I feel everyone should be however vaccine passports and restrictions and the like dont make sense to me For the fact now with Delta a vaccinated person can catch and spread the virus just as easy as an unvaccinated person how does this ever stop the pandemic? The vaccine was always said as keeping you alive or out of the hospital not preventing transmission so why restrict what unvaccinated people can do if the risk is the same to each other? I can definitely understand the push to get vaccinated to not overwhelm hospital workers whove been busting ass for so long but they tout it as get vaccinated to end the pandemic unvaccinated people are continuing to extend the pandemic but vaccinated people now do the same thing I think their message is unclear and I think so many mandates that are based of case count is wrong since the vaccine isnt intended to stop transmission it should be off hospitalizations and deaths Thanks to anyone who helps clear this up for me,Quitefrankly27,16298119330,1

gxyeklz,nb0qrm,This is completely laughable Im sure that the people who havent gotten the vaccine yet have other reasons than it not being incentivised Examples include: not being able to get off at work; having another serious illness at the moment and not wanting to risk a lowered immunity; limited supply and could not obtain one to date; or of course those who dont want vaccines in general Suddenly awarding money for those who have received it at the expense of having $5 million to do something else with that could benifot hundreds of people,Critical-Coat-1593,16208933390,1

gybc19e,ndkvik,So in the facility I work in (6000+ people) we are allowing for fully vaccinated people to go without masks My company arranged for people to be vaccinated on site and before that arranged for people to get vaccinated offsite We know who the people are that did not or will not get vaccinated mainly because they wont shut up about how much of a hoax it all is This policy change came out after work on Friday Monday is going to be a shit show &#x200B; \*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\*\* TLDR: There was no shit show So Facility management sent out emails reminding people that only those that were fully vaccinated were allowed to have their masks off They also reminded people that they dont want any integrity issues by lying about being vaccinated My field requires a security clearance so a integrity issue could compromise that Walked into work today and the people who were still required to wear a mask wore one I heard minimal griping about the change in policy from the people who were unvaccinated I dont know if any minds were changed about getting the vaccine but Im appreciative that my coworkers are sticking to the mask policy,johnqpublic81,16211648840,2647
gybqebq,ndkvik,Of course theyll lie the CDC knows that Everyone knows that Not all of us were born yesterday It sucks for those that are incapable of vaccinating but I dont know how else the CDC is supposed to proceed under the assumption that the vaccines are as effective as they are They cant force people to get shots the anti-maskers will continue to refuse shots those that cant get shots but otherwise want them cant get vaccinated and most people that want the shot are getting it They also cant expect masks to work forever just because more people get sick of them by the day Eventually people will just accept the risk like many had already been doing Really there is no way forward for the CDC with the pre-existing guidance which is why the guidance changed The belief that everyone should get vaccinated comes from the desire to eradicate COVID; that ship has sailed as early as last June and we still expect the cows to come back to the barn The cows are gone: COVID is here to stay The CDC finally threw its hands up and said "ok you want to deal with Covid? Fuck it have all the Covid you want If you want to live you know where the vaccine is" Frankly I cant blame them and would probably do the same myself I feel bad for those that cant get the Covid shot for allergies or whatever else but I dont feel bad at all if someone gets sick because they refuse to get the vaccine Now its like any other anti-vaxxor talking point,AyyyGreens,16211740740,119

gyd6qgd,ndkvik,Its too early for masks off in public indoors We should wait until 1 There has been enough time for everyone who wants the vaccine to be FULLY vaccinated including in blue areas where appointments have been less available Many age groups have only been recently eligible in some states Also dont forget people without car access need more time 2 At least 50% of the total population is FULLY vaccinated (that means a full 6 weeks after first dose) 3 Ideally until cases are down but if idiots stop us from achieving that this summer we can at least keep masks on until the only people left 12 or older and not FULLY vaccinated are TRULY just the anti-vaxxers 4 The most ideal of all would be for most people to keep wearing masks indoors in public until fall so the 2-11 age group could be included This would also crush the case numbers even more Obviously its fine for fully vaccinated people to have private unmasked indoor parties but in public a lot of lying unmasked people just means that people still waiting for their appointments and partially vaccinated people are now forced to stay at home even more than before or may be in an unsafe environment at work Because other peoples masks protect you more than your own mask And there are definitely going to be some people who stop wearing a mask just because no one else is wearing masks or because someone is harassing them for still wearing a mask,kittey257,16211982160,2

hc8f8x0,pl59ch,Pros: More vaccinated = fewer hospitals overloaded Cons: more people quitting jobs to avoid the vaccine While the increased vaccination rate should slow the spread and decrease the number of hospitalizations thereby decreasing the unsustainable load on our failing healthcare system this move may also trigger a wave of resignations from the workforce at a time when labor is already in short supply Diregarding for a moment the arguments around freedom of choice and the role of government in our lives the question is: will this mandate have a net positive effect on our society? Does the anticipated decrease in hospitalizations outweigh the potential decrease in the labor force? Consider also the compounding effects of a labor shortage ( yes I know its actually a wage shortage) on the already fractured supply chain Additionally how much benefit will we actually see from this mandate if (when) a vaccine resistant variant of covid begins to dominate?

gw80t1q,n0j4gg,I honestly think the biggest thing here is that we really need a school system that teaches critical thinking and problem solving I used to listen to that podcast quite a bit but was tapering off a lot before it went over to spotify (which killed it to for me entirely) I felt like there was a fair amount of honest discussion and points were brought up that I wouldnt think of myself There was also plenty of stuff I completely disagree with Theres also a ton of banter and half cocked joke ideas I dont listen anymore so really dont know or care how this particular podcast went The real problem is that people are so devoid of the ability to think critically that they cant evaluate a statement its context and whether its coming from a place primarily of opinion vs research etc If it is given as actual advice does it actually make sense? Who are the guests? Are they experts what credentials do they have who do they work for are they bro-ing it up by bullshitting/bantering on a podcast or are they seriously describing their field of study? Are they trying to make themselves look good? Etc etc If Joe Rogan (or anyone else expert or otherwise) looks you in the eyes and seriously tells you something like "Cigarettes arent bad for you its all government propaganda" I would hope you have enough going on in your head to think to yourself "hey that probably isnt right" Maybe dont live your life by that advice just yet This is true of people who both love and hate this podcast There were plenty of instances where something was said that people heavily criticized that were clearly off the cuff remarks or jokes Theres also things that were said with authority and under the guise of expertise that were flat out incorrect or misinformed Taking a celebrity as the end all of where you get advice from is a terrible idea Even statements coming from experts are usually worth internalizing and thinking about but also checking up on and doing a bit of research for what the general consensus is and how it applies to your unique circumstance,cheapseats91,16196457420,58

hpmkad4,rm4ymn,TIL that care standards vary greatly There are massive discrepancies in standard hospitalization procedures across states and likely internationally It seems that people dont know what they should be asking because COVID isnt respiratory Its a vascular disease caused by antibodies overreacting and attacking a protein in your blood causing clots The virus enters through lung cells so the clots start there At least up until omicron Standard care should almost immediately involve some level of heparin to start and remdesivir In most cases this is enough Worse cases may require dexamethasone to calm the immune system Oxygen should usually be used Most hospitalized should be out of the hospital quickly Monoclonal antibodies worked very well on Delta too But what you dont here is that you shouldnt wait If you have a fever for more than 2 days after testing positive and your chest gets tight look for a monoclonal site If the monitors tell you to go the hospital then you go Keep the hospitals clear dont take medical hooey and understand that time is of the essence,Walternotwalter,16402200280,2

gy1tg8l,nbi105,I would ideally err on the side of caution and disagree with the statement by Dr Fauci because of following (I know I might get downvoted but as someone who belongs to a family of doctors including medical researchers I would like to put in my 2 cents): 1) Masks are not only supposed to prevent you from getting infected but also prevent your mucus/ nose droplets from going out when you sneeze It has been a proven fact that it is more critical for an infected person to wear a mask than a healthy person who needs protection Moreover it has been proven that fully vaccinated people can still be asymptomatic carriers of the disease So there is a chance if vaccinated people do not wear mask in public places they might end up spreading droplets and infecting people given they are asymptomatic 2) There is a potential that this will encourage a lot of non vaccinated people to stop wearing masks in public by falsely claiming they are vaccinated I am not saying that everyone will do it but even a minor section does it it might break havoc especially as some of the new variants are highly infectious 3) Look at countries who have really done well in controlling numbers eg Singapore Apart from very effecting tracing and isolation measures mandatory masks at all public places except while doing intensive exercises (ie running in a park/ or road gyms get closed the moment cases shoot up) is one of the key factors which has limited transmission in workplaces malls beaches etc Again I do not mean to undermine his statement as he is a very learner doctor but just highlight some of the possible downsides Peace,TowardsFitness,16209563140,-2

gzvqvfo,nniy3y,Ima set aside the stupidity of this and simply remind everyone that any mandate your employer wants to implement must be applied to uniformly to everyone for it to be legal &#x200B; For example if your company threatens to fire you for being unvaccinated; they must also fire every unvaccinated full time employee that has been working there for years (**employees whom the company has already invested allot of time and money in training**) If they cherry pick just you then that is discrimination &#x200B; In typical media fashion allot of articles try to place shift the blame onto the individual as if claiming "If YOU dont get the vaccine YOU will face the consequences of not being allowed to work"; when in really the language of these laws is tailored to the employers choice not the employee and should instead be reported as "If WE want to hinder our hiring pool to only vaccinated people we will" **You (the individual employee) are not choosing to be unemployed for not being vaccinated your boss is choosing to fire you** So no need to worry about whether they can or cant mandate this They wont do it because it will for certain cause a labor shortage to them and potentially a discrimination lawsuit if they use it as a reason to fire only the employees they dont like &#x200B; ps: if youre going to post the dumbass response of "many employers already mandate it hurr hurr hurr"; please enlighten us and list specifically which ones Yea Yea Yea you read some article saying that companies are going to do it Name then tell us specifically which companies are right now mandating the vaccine and have fired or are otherwise threatening to fire unvaccinated employees,AbortedBaconFetus,16223037430,3

gzvm272,nniy3y,I work for a hospital system and we have been discussing this from the very beginning This guidance from the EEOC makes mandates possible for employers to require the vaccine It removes the legal challenge hurdles that employees could bring if an employer mandates a vaccine with an emergency approval from the FDA (which isnt full drug authorization and not fully tested) However because of the number of vaccinations in the US Pfizer is in process of requesting full FDA authorization By the EEOC making this action it ramps up the timeline making it possible for employers to take action now instead of 3-4 months later this summer/fall when we may see increases I infection rates TLDR - this moves up the timeline for employers to make vaccinations mandatory improving vaccination rates and protecting more people especially those who cannot get the vaccine (immuno-compromised and those under 12),tumbleweedcowboy,16223012420,1

h9y8plp,p9dd93,I really feel like permanent WFH at least for a plurality of the *white-collar* workforce is where were headed This is what the employees want and at a certain point if they dont acquiesce then they simply wont retain their workers I want to repeat one of the words in my first sentence though: white-collar There are segments of our service economy that absolutely depend on those white-collar workers headed into the office every day I think about the urban neighborhood where my desk was located: coffee shops lunch places grocery stores that catered to the on my way home crowd hotels that survive on the conference attendees etc etc Its easy to argue that these folks have had almost two years to figure it out at this point but have they? Have the thousands of service employees that depend on those jobs to pay their rent and feed their kids figured it out or are they still depending on aid and hoping things go back to normal? Im not denying that WFH is desirable and going to happen for a lot of people But in a country (Im the US just to be clear) that has an increasing economic divide I cant help but believe that it exacerbates as it becomes more and more likely that urban office neighborhoods are going to be seriously depopulated if they come back at all,georgethethirteenth,16296641290,19

h9x060u,p9dd93,Well I started going back to the office about six weeks ago and have been there basically full time for the past three weeks due to a critical staff member being let go As soon as I get her replacement up and running I am going to go back to nearly full time WFH I will be informing my employer of this not asking And yeah Im willing to back it up with a two-week notice Theres so many reasons Delta being the first one of course and also although it may seem contradictory the imposition of an indoor mask mandate in my state (rather just stay home alone than walk around with giant piece of cloth plastered over my face) Theres the fact that our downtown area is almost entirely deserted except for the homeless addicts and mentally ill and I dont feel safe even walking to and from the bus stop And then theres this - that all of the peace Id gained working from home for 16 months all of the bad habits Id shed (among other things I hadnt had a drink in months before I started back at the office and now I"m regularly consuming at least a couple of bottles of wine a week) all of the reliably good sleep all of the feeling of being centered and present in my life - every bit of that is gone and after only a few weeks back Im so burned out I fear it would take a three month vacation just to get me back where I was at the start of summer Employers are absolutely clueless about the toll office life takes on every other aspect of our existence They should not be surprised that people dont want to go back to the way things were because they way things were was something we never should have tolerated in the first place,kat2211,16296448020,106

h9yjt68,p9dd93,I dont want to go into the office full-time but theres definitely aspects of fully working from home that I struggle with: * For whatever reason my workplace is hyper-connected Managers are now comfortable booking meetings at 6-7am or 6-7pm and have little respect for a lunch hour like they used to When you complain about it nobody cares "Just wake up earlier" they say or "just stay on for an extra two hours" they say "Its a priority so it has to get done" they say although if it really was a priority wouldnt it be worth addressing in core business hours? We used to limit meeting times to 9:30am to 3:30pm to respect everyones start and end times but now thats all out the window * People know you cant travel anywhere and are probably nearby if you have vacation time This has led to what I consider a toxic expectation that youre always around unless you explicitly tell people youre truly unavailable between these certain hours on your damn vacation Two of the managers who took vacations this summer still came online for meetings I guess maybe its admirable in the eyes of some but IMO is there nothing better to do? Read a book or go cook a meal for your kids Thats what Id be doing * I talk with my hands a lot Being confined to a tiny Zoom meeting box that filters out my arms feels stifling to me * Im not as fast on the unmute button as some people and it feels like I can never get a word in because of it Not everyone has cameras on or is paying attention to the cameras so they dont really pick up on social cues that someone is about to speak Using the "raise hand" function is nice in theory but few respect it One of my best skills in meetings was not only doing that but also respecting the quieter people and creating venues for them to speak Now its just an unmute race and Im always losing * I struggle to stay focused in Zoom meetings Its not that Im playing games or checking e-mails Even if I turn on my camera full-screen my monitor for the meeting to block out all distractions and try my best to stay focused I completely zone out hearing voices of people in various volumes and quality blasted directly into my ear via headphones * I cant stand to be in my home office after work I used to love gaming here but now I just want nothing to do with it The whole room is associated with work and I dont want to step foot in it after I log off As a programmer I used to like coming in here putting on some movies and experimenting with new tech but now it seems like a chore Its like my company now owns part of my house I still consider myself lucky that I dont have to work out of my bedroom though Is this just my company or are other people experiencing this too? I dont even know if all of these are related to working from home or not but they definitely werent problems at my company before we moved to a fully WFH environment Its strange too because we were a hybrid setup before with a mix of full remote people and people across multiple offices who wouldnt come in every day and things *seemed* fine,bluetista1988,16296690980,14

h9x38c3,p9dd93,Ive been managing a remote engineering team for about 15 years- long long before Covid After managing onsite teams for about 15 before that It is IMHO night and day more difficult to manage the remote team And IMHO most of the issues solved by remote work are actually issues with horrible open offices and long commutes- not anything specifically to do with remote vs onsite work Some thoughts from doing this for over a decade: * 25% of people will be productive no matter where they are 25% will be problematic no matter where they are 50% of people work better with some form of office infrastructure Everyone thinks they are in that first 25% * Dealing with HR issues is much much more problematic with remote employees Try dealing with terming someone with a substance abuse problem when you never get to see them in person and dont have an attendance record to support your HR case * Peoples home environments are often horribly full of distractions People put up with this during Covid because there were no other alternatives- but having someones toddler running around screaming during meetings is an issue A good WFH environment will have a dedicated home office and a good WFH employee will have uninterrupted time in that office- but most dont have their home workspaces set up properly * Peoples WFH performance deteriorates over time- especially over many years Especially with employees with kids who only one parent is WFH Suddenly you realize that you are working around an employee who has to pick up the kids from school every day during work hours- folks start building lives/schedules around being able to disappear for a couple hours a day * There are simply no good current tech substitutes for a classic conference room whiteboard session Doing this remotely sucks All of that can be managed with appropriate focus/tools/etc But it adds substantially to the managerial effort required I think it seemed to work during Covid better than it would have because many tech firms paused or slowed down their project work during that period (I know all of my clients basically shelved most of the project deliverables last/this year and we are just now getting back to regular project planning cycles) Well see maybe Ill be wrong and the tech has progressed to the point where this will work I think the norm is going to become hybrid plans where folks are in the office a couple days a week but cant fully live anywhere they want,jakdak,16296461930,43

h9yopvs,p9dd93,I disagree - a little The tide has turned already with companies using double vaccination as their way to get people back into the office - at least for now In short "*if youre double-vaxxed youre as safe as youre ever going to be so for you people there is no longer an excuse to not return to the office*" Those who refuse to get vaxxed and/or return to the office will just have to find new employment Whether this holds will be a company-by-company deal A company which has an exodus of employees may well have to reconsider And of course being double-vaxxed is no guarantee of not catching Covid and falling ill A boss who loses double-vaxxed employees to Covid after implementing a back-to-the-office rule may find themselves in hot water The longer remote work remains the more it becomes the norm and a return to the old ways unlikely However the success - or not - of vaccinations and whether new Delta-like variants emerge (not to mention brand new novel viruses) will be the ultimate guide We are a very long way from knowing what the end state will be,TheFirstMinister,16296713520,2

h9zjtur,p9dd93,I have lifelong friendships and business references from working with people in an office It sounds great maybe if you are young and still in touch with school/university people for your social life Even having offices move to WFH seems great because all your coworkers are in the same area and you already have closer bonds from knowing them in-person so even over video it seems a bit more fun Well over time workers will come and go and fewer and fewer new hires will be "local" to you Though you will have social "zoom meetings" it just wont have the same impact For the past 6 years Ive worked either remotely or with a large part of the team being remote so COVID wasnt the start of this for me As Ive noticed almost nobody keeps in touch after changing jobs from these remote teams Apart from perhaps a reference for a job application there is little to zero contact No long term friendships no long term anything Sure sometimes when someone would move to a new job you might chat quite a bit talk about things but usually those fizzle to zero rather quickly However I have plenty of friends held for decades gained from working together in person We still go out to hang talk over voice and chat play online and in-person games grab some drinks or see a show Those remote people on the "Chicago Team" of a job from five years ago I struggle to remember their names now Long term this will probably damage cities and urban centers Think the rise of the automobile and massive efficient highways created suburban sprawl? Hold your beer for the new WFH economy The continent will likely become coast to coast suburbs with neighbors with tall fences who hardly know each other Its okay you can watch movies in your home You can watch sports in your home You can see concerts in your home You can have your groceries delivered Fine dining some driving service will bring you food from that local restaurant if it really exists Perhaps Taco Bell now? Welcome to your home your prison I cant wait for the downvotes here I can almost smell them Of course some of what I am saying might not completely come to be but without a doubt its a strong possibility I guarantee this first taste of 100% remote working seems great now but long term the unintended consequences have not been fully considered And by the time those consequences are more strongly realized it would probably be impossible to go back to the office or at least a long uphill battle,RedditRage,16296866320,2

h9yrv4s,p9dd93,Shitty managers are the ones that must have "presenteeism" to stroke their egos If bosses feel the need to physically watch their direct reports they suck at their jobs At my previous job I had some of the highest satisfaction and engagement numbers in the company before the pandemic When Covid hit and we went full WFH the numbers went up and so did productivity HR actually pulled my team aside to verify the numbers Indeed the very satisfied team was even happier When I left I was able to bring some of those folks with me to the next gig Team productivity at the also went up exponentially as a primary work from home model took root,bos2sfo,16296728500,1

h9yvza3,p9dd93,Forbes stated 5+ years ago that "Management Resistance" was the #1 problem with remote work not productivity or the technology Execs want their big offices perks and to be far away from their spouses all day And also many are crap at managing remotely vs slightly younger tech-savvy GenX/Millennials,TheSimpler,16296748240,1
h9yw6au,p9dd93,Heres my take as a member of the Executive team: a huge majority of the staff does not have to come into the office for the company to continue to run smoothly and be successful We announced that "If you want to come back let your direct manager know by X date If not no problem" Were a 500 person company 200 were already remote Of the 300 remaining 70-ish wanted to come back We save money in the long run and have happier staff (as of now) On the flip side there is absolutely less off-the-cuff collaboration That stifles creativity and perhaps innovation but not to the point that its worth mandating Another angle is that remote worker put in much more time since there is no finality to the end I prefer a balance personally I go in Monday - Wednesday EDIT: If youre in Sales and your manager/company is forcing you back in then its time to quit They dont trust you and want to babysit activity,makgeolliandsoju,16296749170,1

h9yy9je,p9dd93,I like working from home and I definitely hope itll continue to be a normal part of work during and "after" Covid-19 However I think people are generally a bit to quick to sing its praises The advantages for those that have work thats suited for it have established relationships with colleagues and dont struggle with work-related psychological challenges are obvious But for some it makes their work a lot harder without extra pay For some its really hard to get to know their colleagues in a new workplace and become a real part of a team And for some they now suffer in isolation and invisibly slip into deeper problems with nobody around to ask "are you OK?" Thats not to say we should move back into the offices like nothing changed - but businesses should be pushed into dealing with these problems before they become big problems The companies youll want to work for are the companies that get working from home right,grismar-net,16296759310,1

h9yz7xr,p9dd93,At my company they are doing a blended work from home/work in the office to appease all of us who basically said well quit over this issue 80% of the company does not want to return to the office but seems like 100% of the office managers want us in there Ive been so much more productive at home and knowing we are about to redo the office layout I asked about the private office I was promised years ago I said I have the perfect set up at home where I can work undisturbed everyday and I really dont want to go back to my cubicle even though it has tall walls the few days I have come in Im back to getting 5 hours of real work done in an 8 hour days because of all the distractions and interruptions The office manager tells me "well actually were getting rid of more offices and removing the cubicle walls to have a more open office plan" I asked if that was a joke and he said "no itll be much better for our office culture" I said well I guess I wont be coming back in September then if thats the case That was a few weeks ago One of my co-workers sent me a message this week after seeing the new layout revision and I have an office with a door Dont give in to this if you really want to stay home and you truly are more productive People new to whatever your industry is are likely better off coming in and if youre at an intermediate level and expected to help train these staff you might have to show up a few days a week but dont roll over because youre told "oh everyone is coming back" Theyve been saying the same thing to me because Im one of the more vocal one asking why we are bothering returning to the office at all When Ive talked to people no one is actually excited to return The ones that have been coming back voluntarily have offices with doors and still only come in 1-2 days a week The others in cubicles are new hires and those with about a year of experience or field staff who never really came in the office during normal hours anyway,Silentnine,16296763960,1

h9zzsgi,p9dd93,As a single person living and working from home alone Im looking forward to going back into the office I think flexible work schedules are a great idea and hope they remain part of the future for work expectancy but there is a ton of social interaction that I feel is missing in the every-day all-day work from home life As much as I think working from home is great for those who work better alone or have families (or just dislike their coworkers in which case why still work there) I dont think going back into the office should be as demonized as it seems currently I dont think its crazy to expect some managers wanting teams to meet face to face for more collaborative projects as I do think theres some connection missing when exclusively using zoom interactions (coming from someone who has started a new job and never met any team members in person in the past two years),bdigby,16296961310,1

ha02emc,p9dd93,interesting problem my employer is having now is that theyve hired so many people during the pandemic that well need 2 new buildings just to accommodate everyone once we all go back at some point Which will probably be never Personally Id love to go back to office My commute is only 15 mins on the car w/ almost no traffic and I actually enjoy that drive Working from an airconditioned office in a tropical country is also a god sent Lastly it takes away the notion of work related stress from home which makes me enjoy home much more and stops me from raiding the pantry every 2 hours And to hell Im not going back unless we get better working conditions in the office (pandemic related),rcmlaurente,16296980240,1
ha03kng,p9dd93,I think employees should have the choice on working from home It has been proven to work either way The paradigm shift Id really like to see: Refusal of the masses to work more than 40 hours a week period WFH has blurred the lines so bad in my industry I am working more than I ever was in the "before times" Mandate nothing over 40 If the workforce demands it it could happen,Milwacky,16296989150,1
ha04grb,p9dd93,This is something I suggested to my company in the UK: Hi folks Ive given some consideration to this and would like to suggest the below rules to satisfy a flexible work offering to the SD: I have based this on: 23 SD staff (8x 24/7 engineers 15x Core shift) Image Image Image Each engineer must come in 40% of their time Each day there must be at least 5 people physically on rotad shift Each day there must be no more than 10 engineer on schedule We split the WFH days in any given week between a choice of Monday+Tuesday or Thursday+Friday This grants opportunity of "extended weekend feeling" to all Q: Why 40% submission to physical occupation? A: TeamLead stated Service Desk requires an obligatory 15% physical office presence on any working day Q: How does this impact skill availability? A: It doesnt this is based purely on resource as we have availability across core teams in the working week On average we will have 8 engineers physically within the office space Q: How this is managed? A: Either by a scheduling app/portal where engineers self-sign up (first come first serve) and commit to fulfilling their weekly hours or assigned by TLs Q: How does this solution address 24/7 flexibility? A: Whilst 24/7 day shift must attend the office space 24/7 night shift fulfil duties from home Any 24/7 day shift falling on a weekend is fulfilled from home This is open to your adjustments or leave as is in the pot for discussion and practical application for the business Thanks" Glad to say this has now been adopted  Before COVID happened my company was on target to turn 200m so they purchased a new HQ for 15m We are an IT Managed Service Provider The company had plans to go global looking for offices in the USA They signed the contract grace period passed and then COVID happened They were unable to back out of the deal and have since been working within regulations of UK lockdowns and government guidance to continue with the new head office plan We have lost only 1 employee during this pandemic and that was after he contracted Covid after major surgery Work load has increased the employment demand at our company due to demand from clients working remotely and other IT projects Due to Covid theyve put the expansion on the back burner for now and are cautiously monitoring markets and of course Covid itself They still want to expand to the US Fingers crossed!  As we have hospitals and government clients for technical support we were actually classed as support workers and got full 80% furlough offered but we didnt need to take it Covid has just sped up the work from home culture and those that do not change their ways are set to lose good employees Mental health has been cited as one of the major drivers with a large majority of workers being effected I personally have been wfh social distancing and wearing a mask in public since 2019 when my wife started chemotherapy after a mastectomy So this has been the norm for us long before Covid came along I do think there is a need for a physical space a lot of clients say the office is a place to separate home and work life Ive never had this as an issue in fact I am blessed that I have seen my son grow up since his birth in 2019 I get to spend time playing with him look after my wife and be home "on time" or work late if I want to An hour here and there longer doesnt kill me in fact I believe I start earlier and finish on time or happy to work later I think sales people need that physical connection and banter with their colleagues its the nature of that beast I know from a lot of clients and other companies I interviewed for that WFH was a massive positive to performance and output but over time people have got complacent or lazy and now efficiency is actually on the back slide WFH is definitely here to stay to what degree and capacity offered is another thing Ps feel free to use my wfh flexible working plan ,PrimarisBA,16296996010,1

ha15cdm,p9dd93,Are these bosses seeing a decrease in productivity? And even if they are is that decrease in productivity resulting in a loss of revenue large enough to negate the money saved in not needing to rent out an office? If the answer is no then there are only two reasons the bosses would worry: &#x200B; 1 They are micromanaging and are afraid that their uselessness will be exposed 2 They enjoy the office environment/hate working from home themselves and dont care about what other people prefer resulting in lower morale and higher employee turnover If I was a CEO I would definitely be reviewing the performance of any managers pushing for everyone to return to the office without solid evidence that doing so would be more profitable I get that working from the office has its benefits and some people prefer it for perfectly valid reasons but it should be optional if its established that working from home has not hurt productivity Forcing staff to go in with no valid reason will just make those people seek work elsewhere,Ben2749,16297263150,1

h3yaqxw,ocwhp4,Im glad this is here because I didnt want to post and I cant So here is the thing before the pandemic I had asthma an issue I had struggled with all my life and more I constantly got sick starting usually with colds then respiratory infections walking neumona chronic sinus infections all of this before ultimately getting better and slowly starting the same cycle all over again from year to year with varying degrees of severity fluctuating throughout my life After 2020 specifically January or maybe December year previous I had come back home to Oregon because I was chronically ill and unable to eat food I had gone from 220lb to just 147 in two months That issue is still on going I only mention it to make known that I had previously been in a failed physical state as well prior to the outbreak When the outbreak occurred it did so in Hillsboro Oregon the city we lived in at the time and we had already been sick all of us with respiratory issues Something were all well familiar with and more and equipped to deal with it since it runs in the family It passed like nothing for my family but I as per usual began my long cycle starting with the initial cold step; however when it came to the respiratory infection step everything changed In the past my mucus at this point would be thick heavy and brown and it would make it extremely difficult and painful for me to remove it by force namely deliberately coughing it all up over and over again until all of it for that day was gone and then sleep rinse repeat until fully recovered people I am poor as SHIT! When its your whole Life! You find a way Anyways I got to that step but this time my mucus had changed It was now white like histamine light stringy and sticky This made it near impossible to cough out The only reason my method had worked in the past was because it was near solid when brown and I could use the muscles around my lungs to forcefully eject the solid mass once it had built to a certain level Now as right now it just stays as a light presence in my lungs but at that time I tried wildly to eject it to the point that I may have either dislocated my collar bone documented as having been dislocated as a child or my shoulder I dont know for sure I tried and failed but its ok I was for reasons I wont get into examined against my will at a hospital some time after these events and they cleared me as never having had the corona virus subsequently released from unmentioned hospital Since that time my mucus has not gone back to the way it was and Ive not gotten any colds sinus infections none of it I started gaining my weight back more my muscle is rebuilding with very little effort and I have not changed my diet I eat virtually nothing and I mean that I am daily on a starvation diet My wife currently is trying to follow me she is at 114lb meanwhile eating less than she does I currently am just under 180lb I ate steak two days ago I virtually only eat meat these days Here is what I know Prior to the outbreak I was withering and I had been fighting respiratory issues my whole life despite making more than the usual effort to maintain my health through rigorous diet and exercise which had wained in the last three years leading up due to family a child full time work and marital stress Currently I am demonstrably better No changes to my diet since 2019 which consist of regular daily fasting only drinking milk sometimes mixed with peanut butter and a banana once or twice daily and occasionally red meat and sea life No changes to my family whom I still continue to struggle with daily weighting heavily on my psyche Ive been out of work since 2019 so that has not changed but things overall in my family and my living situation has improved Nevertheless the bigger factory being diet has not changed but my mucus has Im writing this while caring for my eight month old son one of two so spare me some consideration here if youre still reading lol in conclusion I got better after the pandemic and although I was told I had not been infected I believe that I was and I also believe that Ive overall as a life form become stronger as a result Im changing physically and physiologically for my betterment and that makes me genuinely wonder if vaccinating myself against these possible natural dangers is not the wrong way to go? Are we not looking for that key to open the door to the next phase of biological evolution? Or are we just waiting for Elon and machines to make things easy for us? Im not sure I want to follow that path Not anymore Not since getting sick and better for it Comments??,FightingDad,16253423880,1
h3xv3i1,ocwhp4,Honest question - been hearing mentions from multiple scientists that there is also a high likelihood of vaccine resistant variants coming from vaccinated people because of how singular the vaccine works (not sure if singular is the correct word but basically it just tells our bodies to make spike proteins) And because vaccinated people still shed the virus it is highly likely the virus will evolve to make the vaccines less effective Any thoughts/evidence proving/disproving this?,SirPsycho92,16253341520,1

hb1o56y,pf4633,Moderna Incs Covid vaccine generated more than double the antibodies of a similar shot made by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE in research directly comparing immune responses to the inoculations A study of almost 2500 workers at a major Belgium hospital system found antibody levels among individuals who hadnt been infected with the coronavirus before getting two doses of the Moderna vaccine averaged 2881 units per milliliter compared with 1108 units/mL in an equivalent group who got two jabs of the Pfizer shot The results published Monday in a letter to the Journal of the American Medical Association suggested the differences might be explained by the: higher amount of active ingredient in the Moderna vaccine -- 100 micrograms versus 30 micrograms in Pfizer-BioNTech longer interval between doses of the Moderna vaccine -- four weeks versus three weeks for Pfizer-BioNTech Modernas vaccine was associated with a two-fold risk reduction against breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to Pfizers in a review of people in the Mayo Clinic Health System in the US from January to July The results were reported in a separate study released ahead of publication and peer review on Aug 9,actualtext,16304105170,2894

What is acceptable line for antibodies? What is rate of decline? For example if you need 50 antibodies per nanoliter to be effective but pfizer gives 500 and moderna 990 then its moot If on day 14 pfizer is 400 and moderna is 600 then on day 60 pfizer is200 and moderna is 202 And so on Thats why hospitizations and death are good clinical outcomes Both vaccines work great Period Otherwise you would see huge jumps in hospitalizations from the pfizer group Honestly out of the 8000 or so hospitalized or dead and completely vaccinated how many are moderna vs pfizer? Also 75% of those are 65 and up So that means they were more likely to get pfizer before moderna was approved So even then you would have to account for accessibility Studies like this dont really help except to get researchers more funding,justjoshingu,16304292650,6

hb2rtz6,pf4633,Discussion This study demonstrated a significantly higher humoral immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) compared with the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) in infected as well as uninfected participants and across age categories The higher mRNA content in mRNA-1273 compared with BNT162b2 and the longer interval between priming and boosting for mRNA-12733 (4 weeks vs 3 weeks for BNT162b2) might explain this difference A relationship between neutralization level after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and protection against COVID-19 has been demonstrated by several studies4 As such the height of the humoral response after vaccination which correlates with neutralizing antibody titers5 might be clinically relevant Limitations of this study include the lack of data on cellular immunity and on neutralizing antibodies as well as the specific focus on health care workers Whether the observed difference in antibody level translates to a difference in the duration of protection4 the protection against variants of concern and the risk of transmission6 needs further investigation Future research should also address the relevance for patients with reduced antibody response after vaccination,MastadonInfantry,16304283470,1

Vaccines are working So honestly the death data leads me to believe there are waaaaay less people in the ICU vs last year Not sure Im buying these drama headlines or why the hospitals are struggling this year vs last And Mass general on their own website stated they have ICU capacity as of 12/24 https://datargjcom/covid-19-hospital-capacity/facility/massachusetts-general-hospital/220071/ Now Im sure the holiday surge probably pushed those numbers up but look at last year the same time frame They had 157 ICU beds last Christmas They now have 147 Theyve lost 9% of their beds (probably due to staff having Covid) But that isnt exactly a crisis and they still appear to have capacity But just saying do the research for yourself and come to your own conclusions Then again its Reddit and no one gives a $&@% A sensationalistic headline gets way more clicks even if the article is offering alternative facts and people have an attention span of an ant So who cares right? Im gonna save this mass general link so I can check the data for next week Not reaching a conclusion yet but based on this data Im leaning towards "yes this is a problem but its not the end of the world crisis the internet makes you believe" EDIT: and honestly the EMT post below was asking who to blame? Look at the Mass General link and how much capacity they had last Nov they over shot offering 210+ beds Operating at half capacity is not profitable for the hospital so it makes sense they would scale down and run at capacity If youre looking for someone to blame clearly this is hospital managements problem Theyve underestimated the demand for ICU beds and werent able to scale up fast enough Granted this is an extremely difficult thing to predict Who knew right? But this in essence is where the problem lies The inability of hospitals to accurately predict the demand for ICU beds 2 months ahead and scale capacity accordingly,888Kraken888,16413995890,27

gwja6gl,n2hns4,**Michigan is now hospitalizing more people under 40 than those over 80 for COVID-19** Dr Stacey Sensor says her 18-year-old son a high school senior is "one of the healthiest people I know" "He works out every single day at five oclock in the morning" said Sensor a Gaylord physician "He takes all these supplements He only eats healthy And he got COVID at the gym "He was quite sick for about eight days" she said "So Im telling you that it doesnt matter what supplements you take what your age is Even in the healthiest individual they still can get it and they can still become very sick and then the effects can be there for quite some time" Its a cautionary tale she said for people who see COVID-19 as a serious health threat for the elderly but a much more benign illness for younger healthier people In fact Michigans current coronavirus surge has turned that assumption on its head: Last week the state was averaging more hospital admissions for COVID patients under 40 than patients age 80 or older The former was about 78 a day compared to 50 for the latter according to data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services The biggest reason for the demographic shift experts say: The difference in vaccination rates About 74% of Michigan residents age 70 and older have gotten at least one dose of vaccine and two-thirds are fully vaccinated For those 16 to 49 the numbers are 36% who have gotten one dose and 23% fully immunized; there is no vaccine authorized for children under 16 Also contributing to the surge of virus among young people is the spread of variants that are both more contagious and more lethal; the tendency of many younger adults to disregard COVID-19 guidelines and the fact that schools have reopened "Its definitely become more of a young person disease now probably because they havent been vaccinated and theyve been more likely than older folks to go out and about be in close contact with others and go to gatherings" said Dr Mark Hamed a physician who is medical director for Huron Lapeer Sanilac Tuscola Alcona Iosco Ogemaw and Oscoda counties The numbers bear that out In the first year of the pandemic Michigan residents age 60 and older accounted for 23% of cases; its now 13% Conversely those under age 20 accounted for 13% of cases during the first 12 months of the pandemic; its now 25% The chart below shows the April case numbers by age group compared to the monthly average through March 2021 as well as compared to December 2020 during the fall surge [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/WNTiwqVd1gGfPM09p2D0qzVgFZY=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/VQGMMSPTZNGADOVJQPKGAWILMQPNG) In theory thats actually a welcomed shift from the standpoint that old age is easily the biggest risk factor for being hospitalized or dying of COVID-19 But experts have been taken aback by the spike in COVID-19 hospitalizations among younger adults and children Compared to the height of the fall surge in early December Michigans average daily hospitalization admissions for COVID-19 are up 33% for those age 18 to 29 58% for thirty-somethings and 64% for those in their 40s Meanwhile hospitalizations for those age 80 and older are down 60% compared to December [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/86v1e7Apdm4-zWbHd-9Q7X4rAh0=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/RPEUG3IW5JGXTF6HQYL2RBK67Upng) "Its like you take what we were seeing before and shift it down by one or two decades" said Dr Joel Fishbain an infectious disease specialist for Beaumont Hospital in Grosse Pointe "Weve got 20-year-olds who are getting admitted and 30-year-olds requiring oxygen which we never saw before and needing as much treatment as we can give them Weve got 40- and 50-year-olds ending up on ventilators" Pediatric cases also are up Last week the state was averaging almost 10 hospital admissions a day among pediatric patients with COVID-19 triple the number in mid-February Deaths among children and younger adults have spiked too In the first 13 months of the pandemic there were six deaths among children ages 10 to 19 In the past month four deaths were reported Another 65 deaths were reported in April for 20- and 30-somethings quadruple the monthly average The chart below compares April deaths to the monthly average through March 2021 as well as to confirmed COVID deaths in December The numbers show how deaths among seniors plummeted in April compared to December as a result of vaccinations while coronavirus variants spiked deaths among unvaccinated people under age 50 [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/caQyJGE9C2BiswUM2ThU22RJumk=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/ZXCIGC7VWZCN7H65ULFSFE4GPIPNG) Deaths and hospitalizations arent the only concern While most COVID patients under age 50 "dont get severely ill there are a growing number of people who have long-haul COVID symptoms" said Dr Liam Sullivan an infectious disease specialists with Spectrum Health in Grand Rapids "They have problems with smelling with taste with concentration with memory with fatigue with night sweats "So even though they had a mild illness the first time around theyre still dealing with these things month and months later and thats not something you want to deal with when youre 25 or 35" he said "Of course you dont want to deal with it at any age but especially when youre in the prime of your life" And for women the research is growing on the dangers of COVID-19 during pregnancy Dr Kurt Wharton an Oakland County obstetrician currently has four pregnant patients in intensive care units battling COVID-19 All four are "fighting for their lives" said Wharton who works at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak While COVID-19-related deaths among pregnant women remain very rare Wharton and others say the evidence is growing that coronavirus during pregnancy can put a woman at a much higher risk of preterm birth preeclampsia and admission to the ICU and/or intubation especially if the woman has pre-existing conditions such as high blood pressure obesity diabetes or heart disease Evidence growing on COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy: Virus is dangerous; the shots are not Doctors offer several theories on why more younger people are getting significantly ill with COVID-19 in the current surge One is the spread of variants which are both more contagious and more lethal The variants are "stickier" Hamed said which means it takes less exposure to make someone severely ill or even symptomatic Wharton noted the same pattern happened during the 1918 influenza pandemic The initial surge in the spring of 1918 primarily impacted the elderly and babies But the virus mutated and came roaring back in the fall of 1918 and its primary victims during that surge were younger adults "History is repeating itself" Wharton said Another issue suggests Hamed and others: More unvaccinated people are gathering in groups without masks That increases the risk of exposure to a higher viral load which has been associated with more severe disease "The best mask you wear the less viral load you inhale" Wharton said On top that many schools have reopened and children and younger adults in particular are resuming their pre-pandemic social lives "You can see it" Wharton said "Younger people are all out in groups again walking down sidewalks shopping going to restaurants and bars together They just think theyre invulnerable" The good news is that COVID-19 vaccinations have proven "wildly successful" in significantly reducing the chances of getting the virus and spreading to others Sullivan said And just as vaccinations have blunted spread of the virus among senior citizens the spread of COVID among younger adults can be stymied through immunization shots Vaccination programs "really need to target the younger people right now" Sensor said "Theyre the ones who are getting sick Weve done a really good job of vaccinating our older population but to really move forward and get out of this pandemic we really need our younger people to step up to the plate and get the vaccine to protect themselves and protect their families",itsdr00,16198732450,154

h9pnz04,p8e6s6,"The Food and Drug Administration is pushing to approve Pfizer-BioNTechs two-dose Covid-19 vaccine on Monday further expediting an earlier timeline for licensing the shot according to people familiar with the agencys planning Regulators were working to finish the process by Friday but were still working through a substantial amount of paperwork and negotiation with the company The people familiar with the planning who were not authorized to speak publicly about it cautioned that the approval might slide beyond Monday if some components of the review need more time An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment The agency had recently set an unofficial deadline for approval of around Labor Day The approval is expected to pave the way for a series of vaccination requirements by public and private organizations who were awaiting firmer regulatory backing before implementing mandates Federal and state health officials are also hoping that an approved vaccine will draw interest from some Americans who have been hesitant to take one that was only authorized for emergency use a phenomenon suggested by recent polling Some universities and hospitals are expected to mandate inoculation once a vaccine is fully approved The Pentagon earlier this month said it plans to make Covid vaccinations mandatory for the countrys 13 million active-duty troops "no later" than the middle of next month or sooner if the FDA acts earlier The timing of the approval could result in an uncomfortable messaging problem for the Biden administration which on Wednesday announced that fully vaccinated people should prepare to get booster shots eight months after they received second doses Approving the vaccine and encouraging boosters at the same time may suggest to some that the vaccine as licensed is inadequate without an extra shot The FDA last week updated its authorizations of Pfizer-BioNTechs and Modernas vaccine to allow third doses for some immunocompromised people a decision backed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Regulators are still reviewing Modernas application for full approval for its coronavirus vaccine and a decision could come at least several weeks after the one for Pfizer-BioNTech",urbanpencil,16294944330,203

hdlacvc,prsbj3,The headlines are skewing this VERY positively This is actually not very reassuring data in terms of likelihood getting the vaccine approved There wasnt enough COVID observed particularly severe illness/hospitalization to determine clinical efficacy which is why they had to use antibody response as a surrogate endpoint Antibody levels are not a very good measure of real world clinical efficacy and its unclear what they mean and how much benefit they actually confer particularly in children The FDA may have a hard time issuing the EUA in the coming weeks with the data we have now and I wouldnt at all be surprised if they ask for more After all EUA stands for **Emergency** Use Authorization and the virus hardly qualifies as an emergency in children based on this data Id love to argue that its an emergency in adults and vaccinating kids would help but in general we have a real tough time approving interventions in kids without evidence of much direct benefit to them particularly under EUA I know Im gonna get downvoted for this but Im a resident pediatrician and I truly wanted this to work more than anyone Disappointed with how the data shook out At the same time I wouldnt want anything to be approved without CLEAR evidence that the benefit outweighs the risk and its hard to say we have enough data to determine that at this time,chocoholicsoxfan,16321461530,50

hqheep5,rr7div,As someone who works in healthcare I understand covid is real I see it all the time But at the same time even those who are triple vaxxed etc are tired of constantly being told to feel like they cant see any of their loved ones and cant get together with any of their friends but by God theyre going to work And theyre taking even less time off work now with a shorter quarantine People are ready to start living again even if it means having a small risk And at this point as far as Im concerned everybody can make their choice If you want a vaccine its there for you If you dont want it you make your choice Those under 5 years old are such an incredibly low risk anyways that its silly to refute that sentiment by saying "oh but 3 year olds cant get the shot!!" Its time to stop moving goal posts Its time to stop telling people that the only risk theyre allowed to take is going to work but theyre not allowed to take any risks seeing family Covid is real and you should get vaccinated but I can easily understand and agree with why this messaging is absolutely infuriating to so many,SaltySpitoonReg,16408247210,60

People are getting their boosters From what I understand (correct me if Im wrong) its more infectious but less severe The only way new restrictions make sense is if Omicron has the potential to overwhelm our healthcare like Delta did over the summer but isnt that less likely this time around? The messaging throughout this pandemic has been shit even when Ive been "on board" with it At some point these leaders are going to have to pull their heads out of their asses and let us get on with our lives Mandate masks in public and encourage social distancing sure but beyond that dont let businesses reopen if youre just going to beg workers to spend all our remaining time at home So dumb,LettuceBeGrateful,16408352530,1

h0la381,nrqtko,Every year just before the height of flu season we should have a national pandemic preparedness week where we mask up in public work/school from home if we can and get people accustomed to what needs to be done when theres a virus going around Sure COVID is a once-a-century thing but that doesnt mean another similar virus cant happen in 1 5 or 10 years Heck with variants Id say were more likely than ever to have a new pandemic next year Getting kids educated about how to act during a pandemic should be as common as lessons on "stop drop and roll" Additional benefit of having everyone across the country do this is we could put a significant dent in the number of flu cases and flu deaths,trevdak2,16228279610,0

I feel like this is becoming more and more apparent as healthcare workers quit How are they obligated to provide health care to ungrateful and non-compliant individuals risking their own health? In my experience healthcare is a risky and oftentimes brutal struggle against death It can be painful humiliating and traumatizing Which is why sometimes patients refuse treatment Describing it as a human right is just ridiculous When there is no one left to provide this "right" then what happens?

hqripxf,rt54vc,TLDR; If youre using an antigen at-home rapid test wait until 2-3 days after symptom onset (but quarantine before then ofc) Family of 4 (50M 14F 16F 22F (myself)) We were exposed to COVID either on Christmas or the 26th (a close family friend (50Ms girlfriends son 15M with whom he was in the car with for 3+hours on the 26th) had a fever on the 26th confirmed positive PCR test on the 28th) Weve been quarantining since the 26th Day 0: 50M 16F and I took a QuickVue antigen test on the 28th They were all negative At this point 50M had a scratchy throat and was mildly coughing The rest of us had no symptoms I started getting a tickly throat (that feeling of "oh here it comes") late at night Didnt test 14F that night because the tests arent cheap :) and we were quarantining anyways At this point if one of us had it the rest of us did Day 1: The next morning 14F woke up with a fever Myself and 16F woke up with sore throats a headache fatigue and coughing 50M stayed the same I felt pretty rough that night had intense night-sweats and lots more coughing 14F broke her fever half-way through the day Day 2: 14F and 16F are feeling much better! Yay! Hardly any symptoms just mild coughing and runny nose I have worse coughing fatigue scratchy throat runny nose nausea 50M doing pretty much the same as he was--just a scratchy throat and coughing At this point its just been a bad cold for us or akin to a case of bronchitis We all took more at-home tests: 2 QuickVue 2 BinaxNOW All 4 came back positive Day 3 (today): 50M lost his sense of smell dampened sense of taste This didnt happen during his first run with COVID (April 2020) Still has similar symptoms but theyve gotten better Im doing much better still occasionally coughing & headaches/cold symptoms 14F and 16F are practically symptom-free now just a bit of coughing 14F and 16F were 2x Pfizer vaccinated in June 2021 (date of second dose) 50M was 2x Moderna vaccinated in January 2021 but caught COVID early-on from hospital work in April 2020 Was a fairly severe case lasted 15 months but no hospitalization I was vaccinated 2x Pfizer in April 2021 None of us received the booster yet I think we all caught Omicron as the symptoms are relatively mild 14F 16F and I have never had COVID before A bit sad we caught it after 2 years of not catching it 50M isnt as cautious with masking/avoiding crowded areas procedures as we are Some anecdotal evidence if you will We all tested negative the first round of testing and all tested positive the second round of testing So you may want to wait until 2-3 days after the start of symptoms before you do an at-home test Best of luck to everyone!

hqsktkf,rt54vc,I currently have covid very likely omicron (though I dont know for sure Im sharing symptoms with confirmed omicron cases and not with og/delta cases) and I think there must be an issue with detection and early testing I was symptomatic for four days before I tested positive (symptoms started afternoon of 25th and my lateral flow came back positive on 29th - I then took a pcr test on 30th which was also positive) Alarmingly though I tested negative twice with lateral flow tests on 26th and 27th and also had a negative result from a pcr test taken on 26 And Ive heard of long gaps between infection and testing positive increasingly in the last two weeks Technically given the negative pcr test on the 26th I could have gone back to work and my symptoms would have been dismissed as cold symptoms which is what I think is contributing to the spread People arent testing positive negative quickly and especially if they are asymptomatic are going into the community and unknowingly infecting people in the days before they test positive Fortunately someone else in my household (we think the person who became infected first and so was further into it) tested positive so we just decided to ignore the test results and isolate to be cautious,thatstoomuchsauce,16410330480,3

gxjjma9,n8dyxl,Viral vector vaccines like Johnson and Johnsons Covid vaccine work by inserting a gene that encodes a particular protein into a benign virus In the case of the J&J vaccine this is an adenovirus that is genetically engineered to express Covids spike protein and further engineered to prevent it from replicating on its own But it doesnt have to be engineered not to replicate We have the technology to produce self-replicating vaccines The vaccine would naturally spread globally Most people would eventually get it It would cost almost nothing The entire world would be getting it simultaneously Wed still want to vaccinate significant numbers of people to ensure its spread but spread it would Obviously there are massive ethical issues here the possibility for something to go wrong and in some ways basically the plot of a Stephen King apocalyptic novel like The Stand Still you have to admit there is something appealing about this Its also possible to do this for diseases animals carry and infect humans with So we could release avian flu vaccines or rabies viral vector vaccines for dogs wolves monkeys bats and more 50000 people die of rabies every year generally a horrific painful terrifying death In the face of that not to mention the animal suffering caused by rabies is it really that crazy to consider releasing a self-replicating generally harmless viral vector vaccine?,gengengis,16205975270,1

ha7111a,pamuzn,after pumping the message of "get vaxed resume life" nonstop putting a new message like this out there which will be interpreted as: "on an individual level theres an undefined amount of additional work to be done afterwards and then maybe well see" is counterproductive imo we cant get double the vaccines in our arms to make up for the stubborn idiots we cant put twice the amount of masks on to make up for the people that dont wear them and we cant lockdown twice as hard for the idiots that partied on spring break throughout the previous peaks reward good reward and punish bad the work that still needs to be done is with local leaders hospitals setting policy companies setting policy for staff etc pivoting from "get vaccinated resume life" to "get vaccinated require vaccines for those ready to resume life resume life" seems like an easier more actionable pivot to accomplish something (besides just inspiring defeatism) than "get vaccinated hope that the dumbest lowlifes catch on eventually and maybe next year you get to live again but stay tuned" on a community level if we could require vaccines/proof of negative tests to participate in "normal" life sooner i think hammering that message would do more to incentivize individuals than when only looking at things nationally/globally good luck getting the crowd that has already done everything more or less right during quarantines mandates etc to continue paying attention while they watched a bunch of hicks bury their heads in the sand cancel out any progress and continue to stay tuned in after already sacrificing a year of life i know its complicated but seems so counterproductive not to spend time also highlighting the spots in the country that succeeded and have been able to have more normalcy already and to balance the national/international gloom and doom with the stark contrast from the cities and communities that have done it right look at floridas deaths currently surpassing the deaths of their previous peaks LONG AFTER A VACCINE HAS BEEN WIDELY AVAILABLE TO THEIR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS (eg 999% of the people that die from covid) then look at the cities that have reached 60-70%+ fully vaxed having music festivals outdoors with no burden on hospital capacity and (except for those highly at risk to begin with those in nursing homes or in healthcare or education) apart from slapping a mask on in an uber and grocery store already are back to normal it was (supposed to be) a team effort until there was a vaccine available for the most at risk which many never participated in or actively sabotaged while others did their part but now that there is a vaccine for the majority of the population and the majority of older folks have gotten it it isnt going to be a one-size-fits-all approach for each individual: qualifying for a vaccine vax rates in the individuals community co-morbidity occupation contact (or lack of contact) with at-risk or groups that cant yet get vaccinated all realistically play more of a role on how much "normal" you get to have the broader context is necessary but its an increasingly hard sell in healthy vaccinated populations to continue to buckle down seemingly endlessly when life itself is insanely short my community has done what it takes and it makes no sense to send a message to the group that has followed marching orders to now wait for the lowlifes in florida to catch up and then maybe u get your normal well be getting boosters before they get a faction of these morons vaccinated fuck em i think about all my friends that own businesses in chicago that barely stayed afloat before there was a vaccine reading this seeing this new "maybe" date (when it could instead be as simple as letting businesses set a policy to reward folks for getting vaccinated) because of some downstate/out of state hillbillies and it makes me sick,lisaleftsharklopez,16298309000,4

The Corona Cabinet approved: Insulation for returnees from abroad African variant Omicron (Photo: Reuters) South Africa has transferred new information to Israel - and this is the data | Photo: Reuters The contradictory messages of vaccine manufacturers The test of the effectiveness of existing vaccines against the new variant was in its infancy but Modern CEO Stefan Bensel managed to arouse global concern today when he said in an interview with the Financial Times that he expects a significant decrease in vaccine efficacy But Bensel spoke of a decline in benefit from a disease with symptoms rather than a serious illness - a difference that is known to be dramatic in corona contexts as Pfizer CEO Albert Burla was apt to describe: Defense compared to Delta but that would be the limit In both cases the booster vaccines are expected to reduce the gap dramatically " Burla who promised to know more about the benefits of the vaccine against the variant in about a week and a half said Pfizer had already begun developing a specific vaccine against the variant a few days ago "We know the genetic linkage of the virus we have it - thats how it starts" he explained "We started at risk to produce a vaccine We actually started on Friday to produce a vaccine based on the flooring the DNA template that would allow us to make RNA that would eventually women within that vaccine" Israel meanwhile is waiting for a more categorical statement from the two CEOs and meanwhile relies on data coming from South Africa - where the variant was first discovered - and from which it appears that the omicron is more contagious but is no more violent "Data on the benefits of the vaccine - there may be some partial data from South Africa" Dr Sharon Elrai-Price head of public health services said today during a debate in the Knesset I know they are doing the lab tests as I described to see how useful the vaccine against this variant is " Bennett worried: "There is a lot of uncertainty" Albert Burla and Naftali Bennett (Adapted by Reuters) Burla optimistic Bennett explains why he activated the GSS | Arrangement: Reuters At the same time the government is today approving a memorandum of law that will allow it to extend the decision to allow the GSS to verify the cellular devices of those infected with Omicron or the suspects who were infected with it with high probability - in order to interrupt the transmission chains as quickly as possible But just before the move reaches the Knesset the coalition itself is sharply critical of the law Prime Minister Bennett - who saw for himself how in the ministers WhatsApp groups Ministers Saar Shasha-Bitton Barbibai and Avidar voted against - told today why Israel decided to include the GSS in the campaign despite and perhaps because it is a low number of infected "There is a lot of uncertainty and that is why we are taking these extreme measures" he said in a video call with Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schlenberg "But our advantage as leaders is that once we know more when there is more information - we can let go of those measures gradually" As for the restrictions at Ben Gurion Airport the prime minister has already decided that these will last about two weeks from the date of the decision - and only if the final proof does come that the variant does not endanger the populations immunity or the omicron is already spread in the community - these restrictions will be removed Yaron Avraham participated in the preparation of the article,Serenity101,16383425550,2

They all lived in the same house I found out about the situation Tuesday evening while at work went home that evening and called my doctors office the next morning! Thank goodness I didnt get sick nor test positive but stayed home for 14 days quarantine People did get sick and test positive People only care about themselves!

hnflckn,r9otza,Ive been teaching in China for 18 years and this is par for the course Ill first say Ive always worked in the private sector and there have been times that Ive been outsourced to public schools on occasion while working with a few schools in the past What a gong show Not criticizing China Just humanity in general So I came **right** after the WHO lifted the SARS travel ban to China Id planned on moving to China earlier and SARS ended up delaying my departure by a few months There are always sick kids coming to school It really broke my heart Id see kids as young as 4 years old coming to class run down and sick It just made me think "if youre going to run your kid into the ground like this at this age what kind of physical condition can you expect them to be in when theyre 30?" When H1N1 was a thing I was working 3 afternoons a week at a high school and DAMN I had classes where students were constantly going to the bathroom to puke their guts out 1/4-1/3 of the students were clearly effected I constantly encouraged them to go home but they didnt see it as an option because their teachers and parents didnt accept the practice of saying home to get better and not risk spreading their illness to others A few years later I had a kid come to school looking kinda sick and before class I asked the girls mother and she upright admitted that she was aware that her child was infected with FMD which can be extremely fatal to humans who are younger/have less developed immune systems I couldnt believe this woman I informed my co-workers of the situation We immediately locked all of the classrooms because we didnt want anyone in the other classrooms to get infected It literally took over an hour to convince the mother to take her child out of the school It was literally impossible to convince her that shed done something wrong by taking her child outside let alone to a school filled with other younglings She attempted to fight the manager when we told her that she wouldnt be able to bring her child back into the school without proof from a local hospital that her daughter was no longer contagious After the insane woman left we spent a few hours sanitizing everything in the school It must have been a weird experience for the kids and teachers in the other classrooms They normally would have finished class a long time ago and would have been let out of the classroom for breaks but they had to just hang out in the classroom while we insured that wed done our best to make sure it was safe for the kids to come out TBH we shouldnt have had anything to do with this process There should have been some division of the government to contact to have them ensure that this is done properly especially given how this disease is famous for coming through areas and taking the lives of children in waves but yeah we didnt have such a luxury at our disposal COVID wasnt nearly as bad The government had clearly learned from SARS and figured out a way to deal with it in their own way After the COVID lockdown had ended it was really nice to see so many kids come to class wearing masks I even had co-workers wearing masks when they had a cold which is something I couldnt have imagined happening ever before COVID COVID really made me question why the hell we havent been wearing masks when under the weather all of these years I think it should be a given You shouldnt be free to spread your germs when youre feeling ill just regardless of whether or not you live in a free country,ThaddCorbett,16387743750,13

hngskpl,r9otza,Stuff like this keeps happening and will continue happening It seems like there are rarely any legal repercussions for it and often these people are insulated by their culture of willful ignorance There was an outbreak in my community that landed numerous people in the hospital and directly lead to a death (that we know of) And it was all due to extreme ignorance and negligence The short version: Family did not "believe in" taking covid precautions No masks no social distancing no vaccine etc They went to a large wedding and a short while later came down with symptoms of covid But rather than get tested or isolate they went on vacation during a busy holiday weekend (if memory serves correct) At some point after they got back and only after their symptoms got worse and other people from the wedding started testing positive for covid they got tested No surprise they had covid Despite the test results the father went into to work afterwards And if all that wasnt bad enough one of the family members died They held a large funeral service with at least a hundred and likely many more people than that where covid precautions were not enforced For the sake of argument I can see why folks might give the family the benefit of the doubt in regards to going on vacation while sick but not being 100% certain its covid However going to work after getting back positive test results is malicious and/or negligent and its crazy that there are no repercussions for doing that And having a large funeral in the middle of a local outbreak is reckless and so irresponsible I dont even know how that was allowed to happen,AnnieDickledoo,16388035760,1

h632vim,op1283,Honestly wish he wasnt so vague and i worry that itll be too late for a mask mandate if shit goes down like last year I spent a year + isolated with my immunocompromised partner barely getting by and I was kinda forced to work for an office job again so we could pay bills and I didnt hear of the delta variant two months ago when I applied So now my whole office has been open to the public and some masks but my office mates arent wearing them And my manger and regional manager took theirs off when I had my interview because we were all vaccinated and I had the option to keep mine on But now Im in the office one co worker isnt vaccinated and no mask Were not healthcare but we deal with people every day and lots of old people too My manager said my co worker can remain maskless if they sign a consent form and have their temp taken every day Which I feel like isnt going to happen and it doesnt protect me or the other people coming into our office I felt good about going back to work being vaccinated but the delta variant is making me nervous with an immunocompromised vaccinated partner at home I dont know how to start wearing a mask at work and we have maybe a staff of six in an office and we see about 15-20 people a day I have social anxiety so this whole situation is killing me but covid could actually kill my partner If Inslee would instill a mask mandate then I dont have to be the "paranoid one" at the office I dont know Im going to look for n95s on amazon but I do have the surgical ones at home in which I use it for everything excluding work,chocolatepopcorns,16269235020,13

h8g1hqm,p1oqh4,I believe its really important for parents to have an idea of the risks of COVID to children so Ive been doing some research recently to assess the risks **I am not an expert -- so I welcome any comments -- but thought this may be helpful as parents navigate this worrisome time** (sorry if youve seen this before -- Ive reposted this on threads that talk about kids and COVID because I think its important to have some idea behind the risks): **Morality Risks:** Obviously theres an extremely fine line to walk here: every death of a child is horrendously tragic and I cannot imagine being the parent of a child who has died or been hospitalized The good news for parents however is that mortality risks still remain low [Out of 74000000 kids in the US 519 have died of COVID since the crisis began (as of July 28)](https://wwwnytimescom/2021/07/29/well/family/back-to-school-covidhtml) This works out to a mortality rate of 00007% or 0015% amongst those who had had confirmed cases of COVID Again this is immensely tragic -- simply put no child should die -- but if I were a parent Id probably be more worried about the prospects for long-term COVID symptoms (discussed below) **Risks of Delta:** Delta is new so there is still much we do not know However data from the UK (where Delta has hit for some time now) gives us some clues Lets start with the good news: [based on data from the UK kids remain the least impacted age group by a long shot](https://wwwonsgovuk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19latestinsights/hospitals#hospital-admissions-by-age)Despite not having access to vaccines kids age 5-14 still have had by far the lowest hospitalization rates of any demographic (this past week its been 108/100000; kids age 0-4 have had noticeably higher rates -- 312/100k -- though still lower than any other age group) Similarly the chance a child would be hospitalized if they had a confirmed case of COVID was similar to prior waves and maybe even a little bit lower The bad news? Well more kids are going to get Delta on account of it being more transmissible particularly in areas where schools arent taking any precautions We all know it and were seeing it now but Delta is insanely more transmissible The fact were already seeing records for hospitalizations amongst kids is extremely bad to say the least The fact this is already occurring with no indications cases nationally are close to peaking is really troubling (An aside: interestingly the UK never break their record for youth hospitalizations with Delta but were breaking it now I really dont know but if anyone has insight itd be interesting to hear) **Risks of Long COVID/The Disease Course More Generally:** We still have lots to learn about long COVID and Delta is new enough that current studies dont really address it For COVID more generally however the earliest studies suggested frighteningly high rates of long-lasting symptoms (one even pegged it at a third!) But these suffered from immense methodological weaknesses such as low sample sizes parental-reported symptoms probable selection bias and no control groups More recent research (which isnt perfect and still includes many of the above weaknesses but is at least somewhat better) has suggested much lower rates than the first studies albeit the risks are real A sampling of some of the more recent work include: * [In a self-reported survey in the UK over 95% of infected kids had no symptoms lasting longer than four weeks and 98% had no symptoms more than 56 days](https://wwwthelancetcom/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext)(and if Im understanding the study correctly it only analyzed kids with symptomatic COVID so there would be lower rates for all infections) * [In a survey from the UK of people who had COVID an estimated 74% of children aged 2-11 reported any symptoms 12 weeks after infection](https://wwwonsgovuk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/prevalenceofongoingsymptomsfollowingcoronaviruscovid19infectionintheuk/1april2021) (this study included a control group) * [In one study with a control group researchers found that kids infected with COVID in Zurich actually were no more likely to report symptoms of long-COVID than kids who were not infected](https://wwwnaturecom/articles/d41586-021-01935-7)To be clear: this study does not imply that long-Covid does not occur However if true it suggests the actual prevalence of long-COVID in kids is likely quite low (This is definitely the most encouraging study I found) So whats the average course of the illness in most children (again with the caveat that most research is pre-Delta)? First off it seems that \~50% of children will be totally asymptomatic ([the Lancet study](https://wwwthelancetcom/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext) cites a source suggesting between 43-68% of cases are asymptomatic) Of those with symptoms the one study found the median symptom duration is 6 days with the most common symptoms being headache and fatigue (see previous link) Three final notes: First we need to be careful when discussing long-COVID and differentiate between symptoms that are bad but manageable (and resolve over time) and symptoms which are debilitating Unfortunately to my understanding current research has not really addressed this adequately In the Lancet study at least (first bullet point) the most common symptoms that lasted in the children who had lasting symptoms were 1) fatigue 2) loss of smell and 3) (to a lesser degree) headaches This doesnt really resolve the question -- depending on the levels of fatigue for example it certainly can be debilitating -- but I think this is something we really shouldnt lose sight of when discussing long-COVID Second: Ive seen concerns on here about organ damage and the like I havent really seen great studies focusing on this on children (I very well may have missed some so do not take this as gospel) Moreover in the studies Ive run across on adults theres lots of jargon and its not always clear what the medical implications of certain findings are Thus I havent really focused on it here -- not because it might not exist but because its above my expertise and I do not want to misinterpret findings Third risks -- even quantified -- are hard to interpret and people will probably have different reactions to the same numbers Lets say [the Lancet study](https://wwwthelancetcom/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext) (showing 18% of children with symptomatic COVID have any symptoms lasting >56 days) is correct On the one hand -- if your child catches COVID -- this means he/she is extremely unlikely to have symptoms that last that long One the other hand -- this still means lots of kids will have symptoms that last a long time **Takeaways:** Building off this last point: people will look at the above data and likely come to different conclusions For me I look at it and feel somewhat reassured -- its not at all that theres zero risk (theres definitely not) and whats currently happening is absolutely tragic but the data speaks to somewhat lower risks than the impression Id likely get if I spent my whole day on this sub But then again Im also not a parent Others may look at the data (particularly the long-COVID studies) and still very reasonably feel worried **In any event -- and I know Im preaching to the choir here -- the most important thing you can do to protect the kids around you is get vaccinated And if you happen to be a parent with a children age 12 or over whos on the fence please get them vaccinated too Itll protect your child from a truly nasty disease and help lower the risk for those around your child too**,Adodie,16286229860,6

henx1y5,pxc6hb,Its perfectly reasonable to be skeptical Especially about a vaccine that was released so quickly But I think it was released around March-April for the general public It doesnt take 5-6 months to do your own research on this vaccine There are countless videos of Dr Fauci explaining how it was made what is in it how it works in the body the chances of having a negative reaction the testing process and how it was able to be released so quickly All that information is available to read on the CDC John Hopkins different hospital websites etcIts everywhere I guess my point is that it shouldnt have taken him this long to get the vaccine and the excuse of "doing your own research" just doesnt cut it IMO,BootySweat0217,16328756650,1
