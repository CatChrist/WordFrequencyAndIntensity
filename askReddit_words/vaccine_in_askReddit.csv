hfedob3,q18zrj,honestly id be happy if Facebook never comes back online Its a plague on our collective minds and I think we are all the worse for it I know its somewhat hypocritical of me saying this while using reddit but I think FB specifically has hurt our country (united states) a lot specifically and the world in general It has enabled the spread of misinformed conspiracies to such a dangerous level that people are not taking a life saving vaccine during a deadly multi year pandemic it also helps dangerous groups of people coordinate in a way that was not foreseen when FB came out Thats not even getting into how its completely changed the world of politics and elections I dont know what the solution is but I believe we need to rethink how social media works Its a very useful tool that gives people a voice they never could have had before but thats also the problem its a double edged sword and its currently out of balance in my opinion EDIT: and before someone says it im not advocating for censorship I am an artist and I dont believe that is ever a good solution But something needs to change,GhoulArtist,16333802530,1

gvuw5bi,myeqin,It would depend on a few factors 1) Depends on the home Retirement homes and nursing homes at least where I live are *very* different - retirement homes are for those who can live pretty independently (ie can wash themselves feed themselves toilet themselves etc) while nursing homes are for people who need more care such as washing dressing toileting medication administration etc Therefore interacting with people in a retirement home would be vastly different from those in a nursing home 2) Depends on the expectation of hours and types of activities expected of me I work 12-hour shifts On working days I dont have "a few hours" to spare However I could drop down to a part-time job or one with less demanding hours if I didnt have to pay rent Also am I just expected to hang out and interact with the residents or do I actually have to do work like washing people or cleaning? 3) What are my living arrangements like? Can I bring my cat? Can I expect a reasonable amount of privacy? Can I lock my door? People with dementia tend to wander and I know some can go into the wrong room and rummage through other peoples thingsor worse 4) Is it only rent-free or am I provided other things such as access to amenities meals etc? If I dont have to pay for most of my food or pay hydro fees then that would just sweeten the deal further and make the arrangement more appealing OVERALL Id probably go for it as long as I only had to hang out with the residents (and NOT have to do actual work) especially if it were just a retirement home I work as an RN I dont mind the elderly I can deal with most behaviours (but as I said as long as I can lock my door) Death? Sure it can be sad but death is not the worst thing in the world For a lot of people especially the very old its a relief A lot of older people have so many stories to tell I once volunteered at a nursing home and there was one lady who would carry secret military information in WW2 She would tell us of all the interesting people she met too One nursing home resident I looked after was a former nurse As a nursing student (at the time) she would tell me what it was like to be a nurse when she was younger - a far different experience than mine I love hearing what the world was like decades ago Not technically a nursing home resident but my dad has told me things that fascinate me He remembers going to school before ballpoint pens were the norm He said they would take turns refilling the ink wells at everyones desk in the classroom He told me how they practiced handwriting intensively and the teacher would correct them on things like the slant of their letters He said getting his COVID vaccine brought back memories of him waiting in line for the newly-released polio vaccine He watched the moon landing and gave money to Terry Fox as he ran through Toronto All of this happened before I was even born Obviously this would not be something I would do forever - it would just be for a couple of years perhaps while I saved some money to move into my own place,duckface08,16193841440,1

gxcqyiy,n79n8y,Mine pertains to side effects of coronavirus vaccines Before I got vaccinated I did a very thorough research of potential side effects especially those not officially mentioned on the list that you see when you sign up to get vaccinated The list only mentions minor side effects like the usual headache joint and muscle pain fever and of course the injection site pain/swelling aka "covid arm" What they dont mention are stuff like swollen lymph nodes screwed up menstrual cycles numbness/tingling sensations nose bleeds diarrhea vertigo tinnitus heart palpitations and other horrific things that people over at https://wwwredditcom/r/CovidVaccinated/new/ mention The first thing I did was make sure I was well hydrated days before the appointment Im a heavy drinker of water and juice so no problem with that Next I read that moving and exercising the arm youre gonna get injected at can reduce the stinging pain a lot as it would allow the vaccine to spread more easily and be absorbed I only ate mandarin fruits the night before the vaccination so that I can poop it out before the appointment so when the shot takes effect I wont have anything to really vomit or poop out As for the heart palpitations I practiced deep breathing in order to force my heart to beat slower I wasnt alone on the vaccination day Its actually my family who signed me up (they have all of my documents) and they were underestimating the side effects I kept warning them to be careful and not treat this like any kind of previous vaccines weve had because there are many negative side effect reports that werent listed I urged them to buy Tylenol because who knows how severe the vaccine will affect us Day of the vaccine we all got our shots Just as I expected within 30 minutes my injection site down to my elbow started to get a numb/tingling feeling like when you sleep on your arm in a bad way I immediately forced my arm to move around and massaged it There was also the stinging pain of course but I forced it anyway until the feeling subsided I also had the headache which lasted for hours but thankfully probably due to me drinking so much water and juice the pain was just comparable to working in front of the computer for a whole day something Im very used to I also had chills and fever but I was prepared and it didnt really bother me that much because Ive felt worse before Up to this day I still havent opened up my bottle of Tylenol because the pain never got to the point that made me desperate for a pain reliever I was only sick for 2 days On the other hand my family members who underestimated the side effects ended up taking Tylenol because they couldnt bear the pain Imagine if I didnt tell them to buy Tylenol they probably would have sent me out to buy it for them Its always better to overprepare for something than be caught helpless later on,Adeno,16204464860,3

Its strange to be stuck at home and avoiding neighbors But I still made friends with a couple of them somehow Anyway I was totally mentally prepared going in and Im still just fine about the whole thing in comparison to many others I know When the incidence numbers are lower again & Ive got a vaccine in me Ill see my friends Till then Im just doing other things,serrated_edge321,16204535760,1

gvdlmnc,mvicaw,ICU nurse here (6 years) Dealt with COVID since March 2020 (actually had the first confirmed pt at our hospital) November-February was rough I had a two week streak where every day one or two of my patients would die Wed go up to 3 oor 4 patient assignments (the norm is 2:1 or 1:1 if on certain equipment) Most all of the patients understood the severity of what they had A handful didnt believe they had COVID even though removing hi flow O2 or their BIPAP would put their sats down into the 60s or 70s Many had comorbidities that put them at risk (COPD/asthma obesity/sleep apnea smoking) I think people would refuse to be intubated because they knew what the outcome would be Fight hope pray fingers crossed whatever you want to call it delaying the inevitable Our ICU attending would actually have them sign consent for intubation (if they were cognizant enough to do so) Almost all of them died Very few made it out alive but still so sick and debilitated (some with trachs) One guy in particular sticks out This was right after Christmas 21 years old hx DM1 obesity sleep apnea didnt like to take his insulin Admitted with COVID Didnt believe he had it Should have been tubed days before but refused then he ended up being intubated emergently Took about 5 of us to prone him (lay him on his stomach) because his O2 sats were in the 60s Couldnt get a pulse (noticed no waveform on the art line) Had to flip him back over to do CPR for about an hour or so before we called it Had a kid and a fiancee Honestly it was more of the families that denied their loved one had COVID Upset (understandably) about not being able to visit Zoom calls just dont cut it I say this all as my parents (mom/SD and dad/SM) are all covid deniers even when I tell them what its like "Well those people had other things wrong with them though they were older" they tell me They send me links about all the conspiracy theories re:covid I got the Moderna in December and January still havent told them Its awful The facial swelling alone from being prone is enough to give a person nightmares Watching someone go into multi system organ failure needing dialysis unable to put them back onto their back being maxed out on ventilator settings and that still not being enough to the point of barotrauma and collapsing a lung and needing a chest tube to reinflate it Families saying "do everything" even though they had coded once or twice Hearing families on Zoom crying praying singing as the patient is intubated sedated and paralyzed so the ventilator can do the work Tearing up under all the PPE because yeah we are still human We work so hard and sometimes it doesnt fucking matter But we go back day after day I wish people who dont believe could see what I have seen It might scare them enough to take precautions seriously and get the vaccine,dalek_max,16190435750,5689

gvet2d0,mvicaw,Im an ER doc Ive seen hundreds of cases and I live in trump country Most of them came around once the official diagnosis was made Certain patients would come in and you know its covid just by looking at them Usually theyre profoundly hypoxic (oxygen saturations 30-50%) and they didnt look like theyre working hard to breath I would explain that I think its covid and be met with some BS about how I want to make more money its a hoax or whatever politicized BS I spent a lot of time telling them to shut up about politics and listening to the news for health information Chastising them for using Facebook or 24/7 news as legitimate source versus listening to a physician with a decade of experience actually seemed to work for many of my patients Im a blunt person and just said "dude I dont care what you think Based on my experience youve got covid If you want to trust trump with your health than go ask him When youre ready to trust an actual expert Ill be here" When the diagnosis was official most accepted it if they didnt before One of the most annoying things was a family called to have me change the death certificate of their loved one Sorry not sorry he died in a covid unit thus covid played some sort of role Right now I love guilting people into trying to get the vaccine Now we have a new president some of the covid conspiracies have died down and I spend an extra 5 minutes discussing the science behind the vaccines and importance of getting them Things are much less heated and its easier to explain why its important for their health without it being made into a political argument Whats is the most frustrating to me isnt the covid deniers that are sick Its those that are relatively ok that dont think its a big deal Just dumbasses that send their child with a fever to school after they have a known contact thats positive for covid They should be quarantining regardless but especially with a fever Its straight up reckless endangerment of other people I saw soooo many people like this They look at me like Im stupid when I tell them they absolutely cannot go out I know quarantining at home is difficult on many of my patients but its the lack of regard for those they could hurt that pisses me off,cerasmiles,16190666530,7

gve3i3r,mvicaw,Not a doctor Im actually a research coordinator for COVID vaccines And this is actually the opposite situation So as you probably know the vaccines are tested in clinical trials before they are released So once the vaccine is approved or at least emergency approved we bring all the patients back in for the study and get them vaccinated (the process is different from study to study) So when Moderna was released we brought all the Moderna patients back in we unblind them and everyone who got placebo can now have their vaccine So each patient I see I ask them (cuz Im curious) if they think they got the vaccine As you can probably guess most people are right Around 80% can guess if they did or didnt have it The 20% that are wrong are the people who successfully got a vaccine but didnt have any symptoms yes uncommon but it does happen (Id ballpark it at 33% of my patients that were vaccinated didnt get any symptoms) Well one day I had a lady who was a known hypochondriac She was 100% sure she got vaccine Muscle soreness the next day on both injections fever night sweats nausea you name it she had all the symptoms reported TWICE (for both injections) no joke this lady got a placebo it absolutely blew her mind Needless to say she is the butt of every joke at work now,Nickjames116425,16190523770,5

gvdon71,mvicaw,I am a physician and regularly care for patients with diseases far worse than covid so maybe my perspective is warped If anyone would like a different perspective here it is Just like in others areas of life there are varying attitudes amongst physicians and I have many peers who agree with me The data in the effectiveness of cloth masks preventing the transmission of a partially airborne highly infectious respiratory virus in the community is weak at best And even if they did work It is curious why some are so desperate to believe they dont work both ways (they only prevent the virus from getting out not getting in which from a biophysics standpoint is highly dubious) so asymptomatic bystanders must be mandated by law to conform to the neuroses of those afraid of a virus with a survival rate well over 99% for all comers that mainly kills the morbidly obese and those near the end of their life who would die from a variety of infectious causes should they contract them We should be able to discuss what the value of liberty is in this society and make individual risk assessments about what is appropriate If you are scared you might die from coronavirus the solution is not to make everyone on an airplane wear a marginally effective (at best) symbol that you can see to calm your nerves the solution is to not get on an airplane because that is something you are personally uncomfortable with Its an incredibly selfish and dishonest way of thinking The retort is that X amount have died dont you care about people dying? The uncomfortable truth is that people die from all sorts of things that is the nature of life and when we leave our house and engage in normal life there will always be risks If this virus had a 25% death rate wed be having a different conversation But it doesnt No one wants to think about this rationally and lets be honest there are plenty who love the masks because they are a visual symbol to identify what you believe and they love the fact that they can force other people to wear them in public because they know they hate it This kind of thinking all goes together Only the government can determine how you should act what you should wear where you can go and how you should be able to protect yourself and your family etc It is disingenuous to boil this down to "if you question the efficacy of masks or the constitutionality of mandates regardless of efficacy then you must be a rather stupid person and we should shame and make fun of you" It is much deeper than that and what arguments like that really are are ad hominems that try to shut down debates and bully everyone into agreement There are plenty of my physician colleagues who agree with me and up until last year when masks became politicized because of mandates based on weak/no data it was well understood in the scientific community that only fit tested n95 masks conveyed any meaningful level of protection and that surgical masks offered little benefit outside of a healthcare environment and certainly not homemade cloth masks What changed? Politics Was there a study that suddenly showed people can safely engage in normal activities with masks on? No but there was a randomized trial from Denmark the Danmask study that at the very least cast doubt on the efficacy of mask mandates but it is verboten to discuss it yet we routinely cite far weaker studies on a daily basis The fact that Dr Fauci is wearing his cute masks with cartoons on it after receiving the vaccine speaks volumes Yes you can still get the virus after receiving the vaccine but the vaccine reduces the odds by orders of magnitudes and significantly lessens its severity of you contract it So your already extremely low odds of death from the virus are now even more extremely remote There is no level other than zero that will satisfy Dr Fauci and the fear mongers because they know there is a decent chance this pandemic will be endemic and the virus will not go away Does that justify permanent suspension of liberty for the rest of our lives with the government telling you where you can go and what you have to do and wear on public? We lived with smallpox a far more deadly virus for a very long time and it was one of the few infectious diseases we were able to eradicate completely with vaccines Yet we did not shut our societies down and isolate everyone during the process People died from smallpox Lots of them That is the nature of life The whole thing is pathetic And its especially sad when highly educated doctors tell people they need a vaccine after recently recovering from covid (they dont) and that we need to keep wearing masks despite having immunity (we dont) Its obvious there is something else going on If you want to wear a mask in the community nobody is stopping you By voluntarily wearing a mask you are basically saying that you disagree that this virus has any significant aersolized component (it does) as the aerosol cannot be contained by non n95 masks So if its droplet only then just stay a few feet away from people without masks on if you are going to be around them for more than a few minutes Problem solved Or just get the vaccine and live your life normally without ever worrying about masks or distancing again Once you get the vaccine the pandemic is essentially over for you Period So stop,RangeOrnery,16190450240,-20

h0rqkkn,nt3y49,Rabies Most people know its serious not many people realize HOW serious It has a 100% fatality rate as soon as you show symptoms The one person who "survived" was in an extended coma and is still basically crippled for life There is no possible way to cure it when symptoms start to appear And it kills you with hallucinations pain insanity and confusion before you asphyxiate its a horrible death Thankfully the vaccine is nearly 100% effective IF you get it in time So if you get bitten by a wild animal ESPECIALLY a bat or raccoon always ALWAYS call public health in your area,fencerman,16229615520,4
h0r9kyf,nt3y49,Not getting vaccinated (not just for COVID) is really dangerous Not just because youre more susceptible to getting a disease but are also more susceptible to spread it to other people who cant get vaccinated (often theyre the ones most likely to die from the disease too) Many common diseases in the 20th century are more deadly than people realize Measles for example hospitalizes one in every 4 people who get it Meaning if nobody got vaccinated and just ran around our healthcare systems would almost instantly get overwhelmed There used to be only 30-100 cases before the anti-vax movement gained traction 2014 saw over 600 cases The MMR vaccine is over 90 percent effective so if you get vaccinated youre saving about 3 people from getting hospitalized because on average you spread measles to about 12 people We have a preventative cure that requires little time or commitment and its imperative that people realize the implications of not getting vaccinated,Blender_God,16229491590,9

h8fmfr8,p1f1gn,Someone had already stated my original answer of Andrew Wakefield eloquently enough I am going to go with another more recent person Donald J Trump 45th President of the United States of America This isnt going to be a statement on his awful economic policy driving up the national debt while making the rich richer or his responsibility for the rise in explicit xenophobia and white nationalism This is in response to his action and inaction to the COVID-19 pandemic He received information in late January of the worry of a new very infectious virus appearing i Wuhan China He sat on this information and chose not to disseminate it to the public for fears the apprehension would tank the stock market Trump had for the entirety of his Presidency equated the stock market to his economic success He also made no effort to rebuild the emergency supplies that were depleted during the Swine Flu epidemic As cases appeared in the US in March and early April He public downplayed the virus saying the US cases would be zero symptoms were not much worst than the flu and that the virus would diminish with heat Again he privately was receiving information that COVID-19 was more contagious and more severe than the flu He chose again to sit on the information because he knew that it would drastically effect the stock market By May as many cities were being hit he formed a task force this task force specifically chose not to act in aide because at the time the most impacted cities were the densely populated Democratically run cities As experts were asking for mitigation efforts like masking social distancing and remote learning Trump politicized the issue He refused to acknowledge how masks would help intentionally made sure photo ops of him were without a mask because he felt it made him look weak propagated the narrative that only those who are afraid are wearing masks and intentionally fought against remote learning because he knew it would take some individuals out of the workforce potentially hurting the economy He talked up BS treatments of COVID including the malaria and RI drug hydroxychloroquine This created a large run on the drug as hospitals scrambled to get product just in case disrupting the supply chain and hurting patients who needed the meds Hydroxychloriquine was subsequently found to have no effect on COVID treatment After he tested positive for COVID he continues to downplay his symptoms despite needing to be flown by helicopter to Walter Reed because his oxygen dropped to concerning level While at Walter Reed he received the experimental monoclonal antibody treatment Regeneron which reduced symptoms but was not available to the public After this treatment he continued to downplay COVID seriousness and masks making a huge show of removing his when returning from Walter Reed Despite pushing the vaccine as a huge accomplishment when in office after he lost the election he made no significant statement towards recommending the vaccine This would have gone a long way to convincing his supporters it was the right thing to do It is also despite being vaccinated himself Seizing on to Trump fervent fan base and the already politicized mask issue many Republican Governors have now banned mask mandates in their state With mitigation efforts being thrown out vaccine hesitancy and the delta variant our hospital systems are once again being taxed This time however it is effecting the unvaccinated and the young more heavily Thousands of children have been hospitalized so far from the delta variant Over 600k Americans have died from COVID-19 Trump decisions during the early stages of the pandemic politicized mitigation efforts that could have prevented a majority of those deaths The death toll is still rising as over 700 Americans are dying daily and that rate is steadily increasing,DelirousDoc,16286166710,2

This shit has been going on so long that I feel like *everyone* is suffering from compassion fatigue Twenty years ago we collectively stopped everything and mourned over 2000 people who were killed in a single day during the world trade center attacks But that number is every day now and we are too burnt out to even acknowledge it After 18 months we hear the numbers on the news we sigh and we get back to work The callousness of it all is overwhelming Youve got millions dropping like flies and we are all just going about our business like its a regular Tuesday And theres no compassion for those who are struggling Even with the vaccine coming out nothing has really improved our situation because not nearly enough people are taking it We have needed help for so long this has been an emergency for *so long* that the alarm bells that have been going off for 18 months have become white noise in the background of society You cant even get done reading one tragic article before another one is published with an even worse tragedy "the virus is killing people!" "Child abuse cases skyrocket!" "Someone did another mass shooting in a shopping mall!" "Hey look the virus mutated *again* and *this* strain makes your eyeballs melt and your tongue swell to the size of a grapefruit!" "Were running out of food! Were running out of clean water!" "Homelessness is at an all time high!" "Look how this natural disaster fucked up this area!" "Rent is going up and the minimum wage still hasnt budged!" And of course: "Climate change will take us all out very soon but *what about the economy?*" Its like we are all working in a burning building and management is telling everyone to stay calm and keep working and half of the company is yelling "are you crazy? Put the fucking fire out youre gonna get us all killed!" And the other half is yelling "the fuck? We cant stop *everything* just to put the fire out do you know what that would do to our production schedule?!" And then management is saying "ughh if youre SO concerned with the "fire" then just keep a fire extinguisher on your person" And then youve got half the employees saying "I have a fire extinguisher and a big bucket of water but WE SHOULD REALLY PUT OUT THE FIRE" and then youve got the other half saying "you cant make me tote around a fire extinguisher all day! I have rights!" But then the fire gets on THEM and they start spreading it around more and begging for the fire extinguisher but its too late,SourBlue1992,16322543020,311

hdro1n1,psin9a,Mental health I feel like governments and leaders arent considering the impact of mental health when making decisions I am an epidemiologist specializing in infectious diseases so I *know* how critical it is to isolate social distance and vaccinate to protect yourself and others I have complied 100% with every restriction and lockdown thrown my way I didnt see my family in over a year (apart from distanced parking lot visits) Neither have I seen my friends in 18 months I have been cooped up inside with my partner and 3 pets for 18 months The past few months have been rough on my mental health I was pretty fine before that (I even enjoyed some of it since Im very antisocial haha) I understand all of the restrictions up until now But I believe that now we really need to focus on peoples mental health and financial positions We have extremely effective vaccines available to us 99% of people over the age of 12 (or 18) can and should get vaccinated Yet we are always under the threat of lockdown due to the X% of idiots who wont get vaccinated Not only that but they overwhelm our healthcare systems so other people cannot get the treatment or surgeries they need The threat of yet another lockdown puts me and a lot of people in a dark place I cant do it again Its at this point where a VERY effective prevention is available to us that leaders need to start focusing on things like mental health and financial security,Gryffindor1994,16322595360,2
hdrp0sd,psin9a,- Imagine you live with an asshole and your only means of getting away from constant stressful encounters is by going to work every day With coronavirus everything got locked down and you have to stay home with that asshole Every time you go out of your room the asshole makes snide remarks about you or says all sorts of bad things You on the other hand cant really fight back because this asshole married into your family and doing so will cause drama and you want to keep peace In order to avoid the daily asshole you changed your eating habit and started eating at midnight so that you wont have to go out of your little room during the day You end up taking all of the daily verbal and non-verbal abuse for more than an entire year - For some reason talking about the vaccines side effects that you experienced gets you branded as "anti-vax" even if you obviously got vaccinated and thats why youre talking about it People have become too tribal about this vaccine Instead of treating it as a vaccine people have been treating it as some kind of political statement "I am democrat therefore I should take the vaccine! All republicans are anti-vax evil!" says the blue people Medicine vaccines treatments they should never be political at all These are the things that can either keep you alive or make you dead Politicians dont give a damn whether you live or die so instead of showing loyalty to your party by getting medical treatment or vaccines you have to do it for yourself! - The politicization of the vaccine ended up destroying friendships and families This made me realize that people value political tribalism more than friends or family Why? Is it because its easier to get compliments praise and acceptance from more people if you show you belong to a certain political side online? This is very sad You should value your friends and family more than mere politics These politicians will tell you everything you want to hear but theyll never give you a second look once theyve gotten your vote and you try to hold them accountable for breaking their promises Friends and family will always be there for you You should really think about where you invest your love and loyalty in - Because of the virus people ended up using "ZOOM" to work online This means that your face is the focus of the camera and everybody sees you all the time Have you ever thought about shy people? Have you ever thought about people who dont like being the center of attention? Have you ever thought about people who are extremely conscious about their face? If youre fat you think "OH FUCK THEYLL SEE MY DOUBLE/TRIPLE CHIN FOR AS LONG AS WE WORK LIKE THIS!" or as in the case of that CNN Toobin guy "OH SHIT THEY CAUGHT ME JACKING OFF LIVE ON THE NET!" Instead of the good old days when you simply did your job without anyone every staring at your face now you work knowing that everyones eyes can see your face all the time This is mentally devastating to people with low confidence or those who simply dont like being watched,Adeno,16322599600,2

hdqz2g3,psin9a,general empathy towards others seems to be running low for a lot of folks which is somewhat depressing like I think the writing was on the wall early on in the pandemic when we saw people refuse masks and social distancing - lots of people were going to expose themselves and the people around them to COVID this was cemented when people decided that the vaccine was also a matter of debate now? well a few years ago I fucking couldnt **ever** imagine that a community like /r/HermanCainAward would or *should* exist but well I understand that it does people have been trying to get folks on board with things like "science" and "stopping all this needless death" for more than a year now and people are just tapped out on giving a fuck again its sad to see but I cant deny that theres a lot of legitimate emotion behind it Im in the Midwest and was talking to a friend about HCA - she said she couldnt bring herself to read any of those stories because they show off almost exactly the same Facebook feed as the ones her family keeps its insane that so many of these people are dying of COVID - all they leave behind are deathly ironic Facebook memes and a grieving family its just strange that weve had to become normalized to this shit,extralyfe,16322491440,2
