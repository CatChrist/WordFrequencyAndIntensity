h42pxkh,odkp21,The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Natures God entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among these are Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness--That to secure these rights Governments are instituted among Men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it and to institute new Government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness Prudence indeed will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed But when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such Government and to provide new Guards for their future security--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States To prove this let Facts be submitted to a candid world He has refused his Assent to Laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend to them He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual uncomfortable and distant from the depository of their public Records for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people He has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers incapable of Annihilation have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without and convulsions within He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices and the amount and payment of their salaries He has erected a multitude of New Offices and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people and eat out their substance He has kept among us in times of peace Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation: For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us: For protecting them by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States: For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world: For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent: For depriving us in many cases of the benefits of Trial by Jury: For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province establishing therein an Arbitrary government and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies: For taking away our Charters abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: For suspending our own Legislatures and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever He has abdicated Government here by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us He has plundered our seas ravaged our Coasts burnt our towns and destroyed the lives of our people He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death desolation and tyranny already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren or to fall themselves by their Hands He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages sexes and conditions In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity We must therefore acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our Separation and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind Enemies in War in Peace Friends We therefore the Representatives of the united States of America in General Congress Assembled appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions do in the Name and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies solemnly publish and declare That these United Colonies are and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States they have full Power to levy War conclude Peace contract Alliances establish Commerce and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do And for the support of this Declaration with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence we mutually pledge to each other our Lives our Fortunes and our sacred Honor,Commercial_Bake4667,16254414110,2

gxpipfd,n9jyqk,I was going to work in a warehouse for clothes somewhere near Berlin Germany Background information: I was born and raised in Berlin and I have a Palestinian migration background I had an appointment with the secretary in the morning Without even reading my application she started talking in English with me even though I knew she was able to speak in German So I interrupted her and told her if she could may continue in German She was completely surprised and happy that I was able to talk in German When she handed me in the employment contract I was completely shocked when I saw the salary expectations I called my best friend and told her: "Im outta here!" Ive never in my life seen such a huge rip-off But Im also a shy-kind-of-guy dealt with a lot of anxiety in my life So I just went along with the secretary introducing me to the company instead of just not signing the papers As more newcomers started to arrive I realized that most of them were refugees (none of them could speak German) seeking asylum I saw her handing them in the contracts (I wanted to save them from signing it but I knew this company would give them a job straightaway which was necessary to be able to seek asylum here in Germany) Instead of the secretary helping them (because the contracts they were about to sign were only in German) she refused and told them understanding German would be minimum (Its a warehouse for clothes come on) I interrupted her while she tried to show me around and started translating the contract for the newcomers After I finished she continued with showing me around Other management members would show them around later As I started looking around I realized I was one of the only Germans in the company Most of the people in the lowest tier were refugees/foreigners The company itself looks so damn polished modern high-tech But the way they treated people there was just unbelievable After she showed me around for 2 hours signing the contract feeling bad for the people working there and getting treated like shit I went home with one of the newcomers We had to take the ICE to go back to Berlin which only comes every hour We didnt really talk that much we only exchanged names and I tried speaking some sentences in Arabic On the train ride suddenly I saw the ticket inspector right next to me asking me for the ticket obviously The colleague who was sitting next to me only had a ticket for the way to work but no ticket for the way back Then the ticket inspector asked me to pay for his ticket (5) otherwise my future colleague would get fined (60) The questions that I asked myself were why did he ask me? Because I talked in (broken) Arabic with him? I barely knew this guy and I was broke af But if I wouldnt save him from this the German government and this ticket inspector wouldnt So I had no choice than paying it After a 2h train ride I came back home exhausted I needed to get out of this contract that I signed Luckily there were legal instructions which stated if I dont appear on the first day of work the contract would get ineffective The next morning I was still thinking of going there because I was looking for a job for a really long time I just came out of a major depression I left my family at the age of 17 (turned 20 this year) the jobcenter refused to help me because a requirement to get help was to have worked for a year After rethinking all of that I just missed all the phone calls that I got from that racist secretary stayed in bed all day laughed so hard and I felt super happy This was totally not worth it IM OUTTA HERE!,monomoe_,16207230620,6

Thats such a down grade and we were a government agency so the pay was terrible I Googled her which was NOT part of our standard procedure Id never done it for an applicant before nor since But something just wasnt right and I couldnt stop thinking about it Turns out she had defrauded Medicare out of millions of dollars and lost her license That six year gap in her resume was her prison sentence 2) background info: during my moms second marriage my older step brother abused me in multiple ways Thankfully we eventually got out of that situation but we currently only live an hour away from those people so were very much still looking over our shoulders About four years ago I randomly got a phone call from some guy I thought it was a wrong number until he said "do you know (ex step brother)" I panicked said no and blocked the number I didnt recognize the voice and ex step brother has a fairly common name so my mom kept telling me to calm down it probably was truly a wrong number and the name was just a coincidence But I couldnt stop thinking about it Had he found me? I thought he was currently in jail for some other unrelated offense? I Googled the phone number It was a cell phone registered to some random woman in a town nearby That just made the whole thing seem weirder Googled her name until I found her Facebook Shes dating someone Click onto his Facebook Most recent status says hes just out of jail glad to see his girlfriend and their kids and get his life back on track He was in the same jail as ex step brother Changed my phone number and I dont give it out to anyone except close family members now Anyone else can email me Was I being paranoid and weird doing all that googling?

gvdon71,mvicaw,I am a physician and regularly care for patients with diseases far worse than covid so maybe my perspective is warped If anyone would like a different perspective here it is Just like in others areas of life there are varying attitudes amongst physicians and I have many peers who agree with me The data in the effectiveness of cloth masks preventing the transmission of a partially airborne highly infectious respiratory virus in the community is weak at best And even if they did work It is curious why some are so desperate to believe they dont work both ways (they only prevent the virus from getting out not getting in which from a biophysics standpoint is highly dubious) so asymptomatic bystanders must be mandated by law to conform to the neuroses of those afraid of a virus with a survival rate well over 99% for all comers that mainly kills the morbidly obese and those near the end of their life who would die from a variety of infectious causes should they contract them We should be able to discuss what the value of liberty is in this society and make individual risk assessments about what is appropriate If you are scared you might die from coronavirus the solution is not to make everyone on an airplane wear a marginally effective (at best) symbol that you can see to calm your nerves the solution is to not get on an airplane because that is something you are personally uncomfortable with Its an incredibly selfish and dishonest way of thinking The retort is that X amount have died dont you care about people dying? The uncomfortable truth is that people die from all sorts of things that is the nature of life and when we leave our house and engage in normal life there will always be risks If this virus had a 25% death rate wed be having a different conversation But it doesnt No one wants to think about this rationally and lets be honest there are plenty who love the masks because they are a visual symbol to identify what you believe and they love the fact that they can force other people to wear them in public because they know they hate it This kind of thinking all goes together Only the government can determine how you should act what you should wear where you can go and how you should be able to protect yourself and your family etc It is disingenuous to boil this down to "if you question the efficacy of masks or the constitutionality of mandates regardless of efficacy then you must be a rather stupid person and we should shame and make fun of you" It is much deeper than that and what arguments like that really are are ad hominems that try to shut down debates and bully everyone into agreement There are plenty of my physician colleagues who agree with me and up until last year when masks became politicized because of mandates based on weak/no data it was well understood in the scientific community that only fit tested n95 masks conveyed any meaningful level of protection and that surgical masks offered little benefit outside of a healthcare environment and certainly not homemade cloth masks What changed? Politics Was there a study that suddenly showed people can safely engage in normal activities with masks on? No but there was a randomized trial from Denmark the Danmask study that at the very least cast doubt on the efficacy of mask mandates but it is verboten to discuss it yet we routinely cite far weaker studies on a daily basis The fact that Dr Fauci is wearing his cute masks with cartoons on it after receiving the vaccine speaks volumes Yes you can still get the virus after receiving the vaccine but the vaccine reduces the odds by orders of magnitudes and significantly lessens its severity of you contract it So your already extremely low odds of death from the virus are now even more extremely remote There is no level other than zero that will satisfy Dr Fauci and the fear mongers because they know there is a decent chance this pandemic will be endemic and the virus will not go away Does that justify permanent suspension of liberty for the rest of our lives with the government telling you where you can go and what you have to do and wear on public? We lived with smallpox a far more deadly virus for a very long time and it was one of the few infectious diseases we were able to eradicate completely with vaccines Yet we did not shut our societies down and isolate everyone during the process People died from smallpox Lots of them That is the nature of life The whole thing is pathetic And its especially sad when highly educated doctors tell people they need a vaccine after recently recovering from covid (they dont) and that we need to keep wearing masks despite having immunity (we dont) Its obvious there is something else going on If you want to wear a mask in the community nobody is stopping you By voluntarily wearing a mask you are basically saying that you disagree that this virus has any significant aersolized component (it does) as the aerosol cannot be contained by non n95 masks So if its droplet only then just stay a few feet away from people without masks on if you are going to be around them for more than a few minutes Problem solved Or just get the vaccine and live your life normally without ever worrying about masks or distancing again Once you get the vaccine the pandemic is essentially over for you Period So stop,RangeOrnery,16190450240,-20

gyi7asf,nehqa9,1991 Changed the dress code to include no satanic symbols I saw this as an attack on the heavy metal t-shirt wearing crowd Approached school officials to explain to me the issue They went with it is distracting I countered with a satanic star was less distracting then a human nailed to a cross and that they could not tell the difference between a satanic star and the Star of David They stated that was my opinion and then I told them it violated federal law for discrimination against religions and separation of church and state School denied satanism was a religion and I had to provide proof that the church of satan was recognized by the federal government as a religion and received tax free status I still had to threaten to sue for them to back down and everyone thought I was a satanist and not just a person concerned about religious freedom,StockAlbatross969,16212934640,15
gyk77s3,nehqa9,This was a test rule so it wasnt technically a *school* rule so much as a government rule - no unsealed water bottles in the test room They couldnt ban us from having water entirely but we were banned from entering a test room with an unsealed bottle Even if we had multiple tests the same day we needed to have a *new* sealed bottle for each test Also we werent allowed to stand in a certain area in the front of the school for some arbitrary reason The way our school looked we had a lil concrete area inside the gate but outside the building There was a tiny garden and a pathway that wrapped around the garden Let me be clear - this whole area was small enough that no matter where you stood you could be seen by a teacher This was not a supervision issue For some reason they never explained even though the pathway was *obviously* built for standing on and not used for any other purpose we werent allowed to stand there,LordofFullmetal,16213407620,3
gyie013,nehqa9,Certainly not as ridiculous as others but here I go In my country there are three kind of schools: Private owned private owned subsidized by the government and public schools My school was the second kind During those years those kind of schools were allowed to ask the parents for a co-payment (now its not allowed) I live in a small town and the school was very cheap but still a lot of people got late in payments and when that happened kids had to copy all the handouts and event the tests by hand We all got a photocopy but the teachers had to lend the original copy for those kids so they will transcribe everything then turn the copy back We werent allowed to have a cellphone Not even using it sometimes theyll look up in your backpack and pockets and take it from you and usually theyll only give it back to your parents not you This was problematic because there were students from rural areas that werent close a lot of parents worked full time and the school only had one cellphone for us to use in extreme situations Like one time I was feeling very sick could barely move and I had to beg to call my mom Eventually they allowed us to have phones as long as they were in our pockets and we didnt use them We werent allowed to stay in our classrooms at break Where I live its very cold in winter and they only turned on the heathers for 10 minutes in the morning That was it Here schools get uniforms and my school changed uniform every 2-3 years and it was kind of frowned upon to keep using the older designs The favoritism shown by the principal to some classes was huge They got the heathers on all morning They got better drapes desks and chairs The class was smaller so they all got more space in the room,didiboy,16212968000,2
gyiq2h1,nehqa9,They brought in a sailor-moon style tie for the girls as part of the uniform in an Australian Public School (ie government run and free) We had never had any ties required for the girls before at this school Naturally everyone thought it was dumb and refused to wear it save for one or two girls in each year in the whole school of several hundred kids So a few days after they brought the ties in we had a massive school-wide meeting and were told by the Principal himself in no uncertain terms that ANYONE who showed up on the next Monday without one of those stupid ties would be given detention So come Monday how many people were wearing the ties? No-one Except the one or two people who were already wearing them No-one got detention and they never ever mentioned the ties ever again I just love how all the girls of the school just silently banded together to tell the administration to go fuck themselves because there was no way in hell they were getting Australian public school students to wear those stupid things,WorldWithoutWheel,16213028400,2

gzwxx7i,nns8ge,Oooh this is going to be a long one so buckle up I live on a shared property Theres about 4 different households on the property (Our lease is almost up so well be able to move soon thankfully) Husband and I are SUPER introverted and we have an (almost) 8 year old little girl The other households are not our type of people Were not prudes by any means were cool hanging out with people we gel with but the other households are all older and (to be honest) toxic as fuck The first time I met my Neighbour two doors down from us she was wasted Im talking staggering and slurring her words wasted I was playing with my kid in my fenced off garden and she just invites herself into my yard opens the gate tries to stagger towards my kid I call my kid to me immediately telling her to back off Side note - IDGAF if I offend adults when it comes to the safety of my child I am that type of momma I will throw down for my kids safety She recognizes what she has done paints a weird fuckin smile on her face and tries to introduce herself I send my kid inside quickly and ask her what she thinks she is doing just opening my gate? Thats rude She watches my kid run inside and says "Im a mom too" So I go "okay please get out of my yard I didnt invite you in" She then starts repeating "Im not a bad person" over and over again and I firmly tell her to leave My husband recognizes that something is up he steps outside and this drunk bitch starts ambling towards him repeating that shes not a bad person over and Over again to him Hes softer than I am and goes "nobody said you were but you need to leave" She then goes "my children were taken from me Im not a bad person please dont hide your little girl from me I wont hurt her" and my hackles went up I shouted at her to get the fuck out of my garden and to not ever come back - the Neighbour that is immediately next door to us Heard the commotion and realized that she was missing a party guest and comes up to the fence seeing whats going on she starts apologizing to me blaming the drinks for this womans bizarre behavior and managed to get the woman out of my yard by tempting her with more drinks That is how creepy Tanya got her name They tried once after that to get husband and I to join them for a braai (barbecue to anyone who isnt South African) by knocking on my back door and greeting me with that creepy fuckin smile of hers but my face does this thing where it mirrors what Im thinking but so does my mouth I told her that we are not going to be friends and to please never come near us ever again That she made me incredibly uncomfortable and that was it I shut the door Immediate Neighbour tried to talk to me about it saying "oh shes a sweet person" but I shut that shit right down and told her straight she can be as sweet as sugar but we are adults Im not obligated to give this woman any of my time I still have no clue how creepy Tanya lost custody of her kids - and it may not seem like a big deal to some but Guys this is South Africa you have no idea how bad things have to be for the government to step in and take your kids I was severely abused (part of the reason why my hackles went up around this woman) and they didnt take me so I cannot help the ominous feeling I get when I think what the fuck this woman must have done to lose her kids Then on top of that to drunkenly approach my kid?!

When Anna was a kid her mom "Emma" locked Anna and her two younger siblings in to a barn like she had done quite a few times before It was to protect them from their drunk father Usually by the morning Emma would let the kids out Until one time she didnt My grandma managed to get out free her siblings and they found their parents dead Their father had shot Emma and then himself with a shotgun If my greatgrandmother hadnt locked Anna and her siblings into that barn they probably wouldve been murdered as well Anna and her siblings became orphans that nobody wanted At the time orphan kids were put to the market and whoever was willing to take them in with the least amount of pay paid by the government would raise them I dont remember if all three got taken in by the same household I cant remember anything about the youngest one if she was ever mentioned if I had ever met her or even if she was still alive Now my grandma is 92 last one standing,Ukkoloinen,16202987990,3

h121yry,ntofxm,The story of the Japanese people from the beginning of World War II to the end of the war and to this day its something then Ill believe its terrifying of what actually happened The fact that the atomic bombs not only saved many Americans but the fact that the atomic bombs actually saved the entire civilization of Japan from complete corruption that would have eventually led to the complete collapse and disintegration of the Japanese culture Using bits and pieces from first person sources and third the Japanese in World War Two or one of the most rape and pillage societies to exist ever This is not something I like to think about it is not something that I enjoy trying to tell other people about At the beginning of World War II Adolf Hitler was not in favor of becoming allies with the Japanese what so ever Even with the beginning of the genocide of the Jewish people in Germany it was known that the Japanese were completely sexually ruthless when it came to moving in and taking over another County The Nazis believed the Japanese were insane and crazy Adolf Hitler actually believed that the kamikaze attack method was absolutely a disgrace and not something that was at all a way to fight a war It was known that the Japanese army would be sent a constant supply chain of Japanese prostitutes whom had been brainwashed into believing that allowing hundreds of men to sexually do whatever they please to them was in the best interest of the country Even with this many children in China and women were sexually assaulted to extend that you and I can hardly believe in refused at some extent that it actually happened Due to the fact that the Japanese were able to have a very powerful industrial military complex what is the factor that led the Nazis to become allies when they had realized America was joining the war The best way I can explain this is to imagine North Korea today Religion for bidden outside news and information not allowed The Japanese people were being brainwashed into believing their emperor was God Therefore anything the emperor said was holy and righteous The atomic bombs that finally entered the war not only created a new beginning but also saved the Japanese from the continuing to fight and not thinking about how insane the disturbing propaganda forced upon them would have led to Japan destroying itself completely If the bombs had not fallen the amount of Japanese civilians who would have eventually died and the number of family that would have been destroyed would be incomprehensible The Japanese spacebelieved that it was their duty to their emperor "God" to continue fighting no matter what the amount of people who then would have died in Japan would be 10 times or more greater than what the atomic bombs did This information is hard to digest and comprehend due to the fact that the bombs were so tragic and devastating but without them there would have been a much much more hellacious outcome for the entire country of Japan and if they did not use the bombs at all Truth is the Japanese were suddenly awaken and saw how wrong they had been led for so many years The Japanese are very strong and very ambitious at ensuring their country is running smoothly And the warnfinally ended the time that it took for 99% of the Japanese population to understand that their belief of what reality was had been a lie The time that it took for 99% of the population to immediately re-calibrate their perspective of reality is astonishing In less than two years the Japanese viewed America as a hero and would consider America ally from that day forward The lives that were lost during World War II are countless and it was an absolute incredible devastation for everyone no one had it easy But the fact that the Japanese were able to recover and immediately realize they had been brainwashed They knew and understood that America had come to help them create a new society that would be better than anything they ever had they soon started rebuilding alongside with the US military and contractors to rebuild their society to become greater than it had ever been before To view the atomic bomb as a device that actually saved more people than you could possibly imagine at the sacrifice of so many lives just seems to be in an impossible thought But this was the truth of the Japanese in World War II It is beautiful that we have one of the strongest relationships with Japan to this day and that the population welcomes Americans to visit and absolutely believes The culture of western civilization Is positive and joyful and peaceful shows how something so tragic can bring a wonderful Outcome in the end I highly respect the people of Japan it was not their fault they had become slaves due to extreme suppressing leader ship just as North Korea is today and also How Russia was completely put into slavery due to Stalin Executing countless Russians in the 1950s These were people who fought in the Russian army to defend their country these were people who sacrificed everything to ensure Russia would not fall to the Nazis or the Japanese It didnt matter if you were hero From World War II Stalin committed genocide against his own people regardless of who they were No one was safe Now you can understand with a Japanese were going through with their emperor in World War II We save them from an emperor who was completely out of control General MacArthur did one of the most righteous acts you could have done he for gave the emperor he told the Japanese people to forgive the emperor The emperor was allowed to remain as emperor however under a completely new government and society believes taught by the United States after peace had finally come General MacArthur explained to many Japanese civilians not to follow him but you forgive and start new with a new set of democratic principles and a democracy I find this to be one of the most amazing events that there is hope for all of humanity if something so tragic turned out to set a path of a new prosperous journey for an entire civilization to me this is terrifying For it is so hard to except and understand how the events played out in this manner when it is not discussed or talked about at all today but it is something that should be known and remembered so in the future Other civilians of a suppressed communist dictator ship Who believe that you are the enemy can be shown a way of peace and prosperity I hope what I have stated and said doesnt make sense it is something that many may refuse to even consider the idea of and I can understand that it is not an easy pill to swallow but it is something that happened Thank you for your time I hope I have been able to bring a perspective to you if you did not know this before or had thought that it was a complete devastating thing to drop the atomic bombs,TheEmpathyEngineer,16231759390,15

h0uh6xl,ntofxm,Ah yes finally a place to share my parents story (one of many absolutely batshit crazy stuff you wouldnt get away with these days But hey it was the 80s) So my mother was born and raised in China (she is an American Italian mix) She was about 16-19 or something at the time I think and was with the American or Portuguese embassy? Dont remember which or why Its been a long time since I heard the story The important thing is that she had a black embassy car plate and they were basically untouchable at the time You could get away with a lot of stuff with an embassy plate My mother used to be a total adventure crazy woman I wont go into much detail about the non relevant stuff but she was involved with a lot of big shots temporarily in the film industry met Christian Bale when he was still a kid etc etc So she had the habit of doing crazy stuff And you know it was the 80s So around this time she was trying to get her fathers cremated remains buried as he had died recently of cancer and the Chinese government was blocking her access to the cemetery in the area (either that or she was trying to move the already buried remains somewhere else this part of the story I only have a hazy memory of) due to some stupid law (at the time it was difficult for foreigners to live in China The government didnt particularly like them and the regulations were insane Still kind of are) So my mother was going through a hard time and was very angry with the government (she has already lost her mother a few years prior She was around 17 or 18 at the time) for this bullshit they were pulling And now to the crazy part She was out driving with some friends dont remember where they were going but this was a few days after the Tiananmen square massacre So there was a military lockdown in the area and no civilian access to the square was allowed They were driving past here and for some reason in a fit of rage she decided "fuck the government lets drive through the square" So she floors the gas and just guns it through Know what else was gunning it? All the military on guard with their AK-47s The way she told it was that through the open windows of the car you could hear the racking of 50+ automatic rifles being readied to blow the absolute fuck out of this car Her friends in the car with her hit the deck while screaming something about her being crazy and they were all going to die which is probably what would have happened if not for one thing: The black license plate The military held their fire becuase shooting an embassy vehicle would have been a bad fucking idea So she makes it through the square turns onto the 4th ring road (5th ring? I cant remember Chinas road layout is in rings around the city center) and speeds off And that is the story of how my crazy mother almost got herself killed by charging through a military blockade I dont know what would have happened if they caught her but she had to escape China shortly after while being a journalist to escape the Chinese secret police They arent a fan of journalists broadcasting their many communistic fuckups to the world So ya know the good old 80s ,H3racules,16230197180,3

hawknvv,pdzzrw,If this article is true its one of the worst things Ive ever heard TLDR a supervillain doctor (or group) in the middle east is/are knowingly giving children hiv by using dirty needles Children pay the price in Pakistans mass HIV outbreak By AFP |6132021 11:02 PM Since his son was diagnosed with HIV during a mass outbreak in Pakistan among babies and children hard-up Shahzado Shar has often been forced to choose between food and medicine His five-year-old was one of hundreds who tested positive in 2019 after a whistleblower doctor uncovered a scandal involving the re-use of needles in southern Sindh province The number of patients quickly swelled and two years later the figure stands at more than 1500 according to data from the provincial health ministry Pakistans largest HIV testing and treatment centre was established in the rural town of Rota Dero in the wake of the disaster dishing out life-saving anti-retroviral drugs But affected families must cover further costs arising from the illness themselves "They tell us to go for further tests in private hospitals but we dont have sufficient money" Shar told AFP describing how his son continues to suffer from regular fever abdominal and kidney pain Around 30 other children are also HIV positive in their small village of Subhani Shar just a few kilometres from Rato Dero Pakistans public hospitals located largely in cities are often chaotic and inefficient leaving rural families to rely on private clinics they can seldom afford that are often stuffed with unlicensed doctors At least 50 children have died since they were diagnosed said paediatric specialist Fatima Mir from Aga Khan University in Karachi who has analysed the data -- though she had expected the number to be higher given the malnutrition and poverty among families in the area Authorities blamed a single physician -- a popular child specialist in Rato Dero -- for causing the outbreak Muzaffar Ghangro is currently out on bail with court hearings repeatedly pushed back much to the anger of many families He denies the charges laid against him saying other doctors have pinned the outbreak on him because of his successful practice - Ruthless malpractice - Poor infection control is rife across impoverished Pakistan where doctors often re-use equipment to cut costs -- out of necessity or greed The doctor who first exposed Sindhs dirty needle scandal says little has changed since 2019 "Things are as bad as they were at the time of the outbreak" said whistleblower Imran Akbar Arbani who called malpractice in the country "ruthless" Arbani took his data on the outbreak to local media after discovering an alarming number of babies with HIV in Rato Dero where he has a private clinic He said authorities were quick to react at the time but that discipline has since slipped "In the first three months quacks and unauthorised medical practitioners were banned and their clinics were sealed but they obtained clearance later on" he said Rafiq Khanani a doctor and the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of Pakistan said regulations were ineffective or routinely ignored "The regulatory departments exist only on documents and in offices practically they are ineffective" In the wake of the scandal the government banned the import of conventional syringes insisting only on single-use auto-lock needles which cannot be re-deployed But a Sindh health official who did not want to be named told AFP that many doctors were circumventing the ban and still buying the cheaper models - We are doomed - At Rato Deros HIV testing and treatment centre patients sit facing a television screen churning out healthcare advice in the local Sindhi language A frail 20-year-old man sits silently with his father waiting for the results of rapid HIV test Paediatric specialist Fatima Mir said successful mass testing helped to identify victims of the crisis and slow down onward transmissions But Pakistan now has to go beyond the vital antiretrovirals and offer more rounded care to patients Ayesha Isani Majeed the head of the governments National AIDS Control Programme told AFP As the sun sets in Subhani Shar a mother sits with her daughter draped across her lap suffering another bout of fever Hakima Shar says she sometimes forgets to administer the drugs -- which can control the virus and help prevent onward transmission -- to her four-year-old who often refuses to take them "We are very poor I wake up with the sun and start working so who else will give her the medicine regularly?" said the 25-year-old mother who has also contracted the virus Many families had never heard of HIV but now it dominates their lives "The government doesnt provide us with antibiotics or multivitamins and we cant afford to buy them ourselves" she said "We are doomed",OmegaAngelo,16303100440,3

(And you can shove your pedantic nonsense the intent is clear) **Greeting strangers** - I dont know you Why are you greeting me? **Small talk with strangers** - I dont fucking know you Leave me alone **Owning guns** - Broadly speaking British people will NEVER understand this and trying to articulate it to them is an utter waste of time A truly foundationally cultural impasse Being half American I understand it - but I wont even bother trying to explain it to them **Driving everywhere** - the country is designed from the ground up around car traffic Its bizarre In the UK I am within walking distance of my grocery store pizza place pub church friends coffee shop etc **"The Sprawl"** - The endless ugly repetitive sprawl I think George Carlin described this really well Just miles of Major malls framed by mini-malls next to mini-marts Gas stations garages fast food etc Just miles of telephone/ electrical wire running parallel to miles of identical characterless buildings strung across this beautiful nation Its so abhorrent and ugly but for Americans they are just used to it **The Tax system** - Americans will immediately jump to the defense of this with explanations about how easy it is or how you can save money or blah blah blah blah blah Its not the concept of doing your own taxes that are an issue per se (Though while I was in the UK I really preferred not having to do it myself) Its that your tax system is so convoluted so arcane so extensive so bloated that often you need a professional or a professional service to do it for you and it seems pretty clear to me (as an outsider) that this system is designed for 2 things 1) To promote a ridiculous and what should be a redundant industry of tax in order to keep a portion of society employed 2) To make it so complex that pretty much everyone is a criminal that the law can be selectively enforced at the governments desire **Your medical system** - Your medical care is great Your medical system is a horrific crime against humanity And that isnt hyperbole Its beyond me how Americans havent stormed these institutions and demanded their heads on pikes - but for Americans its just what they are used to As someone who grew up with socialized medicine your system is cruel ridiculous inhumane and utter nonsense And anyone who feels the urge to defend it is either ignorant of whats possible or a shill Its a fucking joke and its disgusting **Eating out** - this one is just kind of benign but I can tell you right now it would put a British person on edge when they first arrive The amount that Americans eat out but when youve lived here long enough you start to understand why Americans work long hours and its incredibly cheap to eat out compared to the UK You dont want to go back home at 9pm and start cooking for another hour only to eat at 10pm **Office Culture** - this was by far one of the biggest culture shocks for me and even now 6 years later I find it extremely grating Because America is so litigious office culture is I N C R E D I B L Y stifling No fun allowed Only total utter professionalism at all times At first when I arrived I thought "Maybe this is just this particular office" Nope It isnt Everyone puts on a big song and dance a big show nobody acts like themselves Its frustrating and exhausting Of all the things I miss from back in the UK - this is the top of my list I love just being myself I love just having a laugh in the office with my coworkers and my friends and not feeling like they will A) Be sensitive about it B) Be awkward about it Things are just infinitely more relaxed in a British office space I mean for fuck sake I got called up for swearing in the US when I got here SWEARING Among adults!

h46b2ne,oe5uja,This comment is way too late but whatever I had just moved across the country and rented a house with two close friends I was waiting at a bus stop coming home from a late night shift Someone else in scrubs and a nurses badge was also waiting We were both burried deep in our phones when a man came up talking non stop about how phones were taking people over and various nonsensical hints that the government was to blame I shouldnt have glanced up but when I did I noticed he had a pair of gloves and ski mask tucked in his back pocket He noticed I had looked and immediately fixated on me demanding I look up from my phone My brief relief when the bus came soon subsided when I realized he was boarding too Grimly I noticed he was staring and making faces anytime I happened to look in his direction; wild eyed goofy ones obviously meant to rattle me It worked I pulled for my stop too early and he noticed immediately stepping up to leave as I step through the folding doors The bottom of my stomach dropped the minute I realized he was following on the other side of the street cartoonishly mimicing my movements Panicked I called my roommates first They were close had a car and could come and get me in minutes They answered but when I explained they said they were too drunk to come and get me but that they should probably get me pepper spray soon and hung up Reeling I realized the person was now laughing at me visibly having heard my half of the conversation Part of me wondered if calling 911 would only prompt him to close the gap and cause me bodily harm I was in an unfamiliar city had absolutely no one else I could call So without much thought at all I called my Dad I dont know why I didnt say what was wrong but instead asked how my step mom was doing after her recent stroke That I loved him and was thinking about him Part of me knew this person was feeding off of my fear and that if I calmed myself and had someone "with me" even if it was just over the phone that would be my best defense I stopped at another bus stop that was well lit and in front of several store fronts that might have cameras and called a Lyft The man turned around and walked away the minute I reached the bus stop suddenly unable to meet me in the eye as I continued to talk to my father staring him down My Lyft came quickly and the conversation with my dad came to its natural end I explained to the Lyft driver that someone had made me feel unsafe coming home and asked if they could please make sure I step through my front door before they drove away They agreed and we spent the rest of our short trip talking about what had happened When I finally stepped through my door I at least expected my friends to approach me and ask if I was okay But as I got ready for bed and eventually encountered both of them they oddly avoided any attempt at conversation or eye contact This followed a pattern of engagement only when they needed something from me but complete refusal whenever I needed support in return I realized years later after reaching out to other friends that their lack of attempt to even call me a Lyft/Uber or follow up the day after should have been a major red flag And Im sure its no surprise I had to buy my own pepper spray tl;dr - I was followed home after work after moving to a new city with two close friends who only offered to buy me pepper spray and hung up when I called for help sighting that they were too drunk to drive,AlternateAlbatross,16255241980,2

We arent bragging about not wanting kids lol If you wanna have a child have at it! I do not "But thats selfish!" Ummm so is wanting to have kids? "But you arent contributing to the continuation of our species!" Honeyyyyyy I am one person out of nearly 8 billion It is NOT my responsibility to do that There are MORE than enough people who want kids enough for the human race to go on On top of that the government is freaking out about the decline of births And they are putting the blame on Gen Z a generation with 2/3 of its population still underage If they wanna put blame put it on me and my fellow Millenials We are all within age of having children But they are basically freaking out about teens not having sex and it feels very wrong I shivered typing that I wouldnt be surprised if they do a national ad campaign soon that tries to coax teens into getting into sex Hell I wouldnt be surprised if they get so desperate as to even lower the age of consent/legal adult We already know the govt doesnt exactly take pedophilia seriously It genuinely worries me what they might do to get folks to procreate more and its very disturbing that they are so focused on Gen Z Again we Millenials are plentiful and all of us are of age Pick on us We can take it remember we got bullied into oblivion by Boomers Only true warriors can survive that ;) Also whyyyy is the govt obsessed with maintaining the population uptick?

h0y7wod,nuceo8,Today is another chance to post the glory of 5RLP It is not a question of what I gave the party but who I gave to the party Im currently running two groups in the same universe that starts out with a terrorist attack by some goblins in a university town as a distraction for the BBEG to sneak in and take a bunch of powerful items for nefarious purposes For session 0 I made one of the groups play as the goblins blowing up a wall to ease everyone in to the mechanics and rules I read somewhere the idea that goblins take their name from a feat they have done and received recognition for otherwise they have either a number or a guttural grunt or something for a name I thought Id have fun with it so I gave them awesome names: Bloodchoke Gutshank Really Large Hat Too Many Knives and the hero of this story Five Rather Large Potatoes In His Mouth At One Time (5RLP for short) His back story was that he was a goblin assassin who was so good at assassinating his foes that he wasnt even known for it because no one lived through his attempts What he was in fact known for amongst his clan was (you guessed it) fitting five rather large potatoes in his mouth at one time So they play as the goblins successfully blow up the wall and that was it for session zero For the next session they played as their characters and are first on the scene to crush the goblin scum They dont realize it at first but eventually it dawns on them The giveaway was actually Really Large Hat who in fact had a really large hat and got found out by the players The realization dawns on their faces as they realize they are murdering the goblins they played last time with three of the four goblins dead and bleeding With only 5RLP left to dispatch the party concocts a wildly hairbrained scheme to attempt to convert the goblin to the forces of good and after an absolutely absurd set of rolls and a wee bit of Devine intervention from the paladins god they pull that shit off So now theyve got this goblin following them around Hes not feral hes actually fairly smart and has just seen the love of a god for the first time (the god in universe of love and justice) and hes smitten I thought at first they would just bring him along on a quest and just forget about him but boy was I wrong They kitted this dude out They play a protect the goblin comp when it gets down and dirty They outfitted our resident warforged with a turret mounted crossbow on his back for 5RLP to sit in Theyve brought him into major government meetings theyve brought him all over the world 5RLP has met gods for chrissakes Hes useless in combat but theyve turned this goblin into such a sweet and caring boy in the light of his goddess Solasta that he has become an absolute RP monster Hes ascended to folklore status to the point that the other group operating in a totally different part of the world HAS HEARD OF THE MAN THE MYTH THE GOBLIN 5RLP So they now have this goblin boy who now just loves life and has over the course of the year and a bit weve played become an absolute paragon of justice in game Hes seen the world He owns an inn now he has his own school for those who want to repent and atone in the light of Solasta He now has a range of hot dog carts that are spreading rapidly throughout the western kingdoms (aptly named 5 Rather Large Hotdogs in your Mouth At One Time For Less Than What You Would Expect 5 Hotdogs Purchased At Once to Cost You) We all love him Our campaign would not be the same without 5RLP,Frock_Donghammer,16230969740,25

h5j174h,olspwd,So i wasnt walking or hiking i was camping But one night my friend and i decide to go camping at a random spot in new mexico We lived in Albuquerque at the time and i was in college first year and he was in high school senior He lost a family member and just wanted to get away So i pack my backpack camping gear and we decide to camp somewhere simple Drive the 40 almost to gallup but get off an hour before to just set up camp and eat some food before we smoked a blunt i rolled I was 20 4 years of smoking my friend was 18 smoking since he was 14 So we arent noobs at smoking A blunt was an nightly occurrence So just sitting there with the fire going and looking at the sunset that was fleeting we noticed a green hew of the sky out of no where I look at my friend and his eyes were fixed on the horizon where the sun was setting A meteror that was falling from the sky but was green enough to change the sky color was falling on the same point the sun had just set And then it hits the horizon as a red green blue mixture of colors disperse from what looked like an impact point So were both looked at each other and thought holy shit Was that like an alien space craft crash landing? Apparently it was just a meteror i found out a few weeks later but i never saw one with those colors Anyways that was the regular part of the story After that happened i was a little paranoid It was like 8 at night and i make an excuse to leave and say hey if we camp lets really camp like in the forest and stuff Knowing the only forest was nearby was like 2 hours toward santa fe north of Albuquerque i believe So i break everything down poor water on the fire and stomp it with dirt and head up to santa fe So we were looking for a good camping spot driving out to santa fe Me being impatient i decide to set up camp off a ranchers road because i remember ranchers lands are okay for hunting and camping Or its like forest service land/government land that is shared with ranchers even though it is their land to raise cattle We make a small fire and make hot dogs off my tailgate of my truck around 11pm My friend then pulls out some shrooms we bought that day that I was trying to save until the next day He just starts eating them So im like well we have 4 grams Ill eat half and hell eat half Even though i was 6 ft 180 pounds he was like 56 150 So we start tripping a little He is talking about that crazy light thing that just happened and i was thinking we still havent made it to any tree lines It was all rolling hills and bushes So i say" hey lets go find some fucking trees " my friend was chill he said no this place is great But it was my truck and i wanted some trees to see Lol i was a little high off the shrooms but i was able to drive fine Just felt rather stoned Next thing i know we made it to some trees almost 30 minutes outside of santa fe I take my dodge dakota 2 wheel drive up a rocky trail only to find a ranger gate that said no trespassing I turned my truck off and went to see if i could open the gate and continue because the trees just started getting forest like I wanted more trees Lol Nope the gate was locked And when i went back to my truck it didnt start back up My truck is old 1999 2000 and the battery died on me So im like well this is where we camp And we get sleeping bags out and start sleeping in the bed of my truck By this time im pretty high on shrooms I see the trees dancing in the wind and my friend is like yooo this is where we belong And i was like "okay your high as fuck" Which he was 10 mins pass or more Idk really And a bright light behind us starts shining like led lights or something super light I think its the cops or forest rangers and try to play it cool like i wasnt high as fuck A person steps out and i kid you not it is the person who sold us shrooms back in Albuquerque a few days prior For me it seemed like a crazy miricale and somehow we were all supposed to meet that night at that time He helped me put my truck in neutral and gentle back my truck down off the trail which was like 100 feet up back down to the base of the highway Then he and his family unlock this gate that says forest service land that i tried to get pass and they locked it up behind them and continued on a road that was for forest service only Very confused i tried to sleep out a night of shrooms in the cold by a highway with cars passing by every 5 mins The next day i replaced the spark plugs and charged the battery but wasnt able to leave until i had my truck jump started by my friends mom who drove out to help us Drove back to Albuquerque and went to classes for college the following week looking to see the kid who sold me and my friend shrooms He never answered his phone calls his texts and i never saw the guy in class again Typical behavior for a drug dealer i guess but my friend and i played Nintendo 64 with this guy for the last year before the camping trip Still bothers me,trickytrev54,16265383340,3

Im from Kansas so the idea of seeing a monkey just walking around in the street is so bizarre! I guess Indians might think the same thing about me having raccoons and opposums in my backyard One time I saw a huge hoard of monkeys on the side of the highways outside of Delhi - like dozens and dozens Another time I saw a group of monkeys playing on a fence I walked up to maybe 10 feet away from the monkeys when the Indians I was with were like dude you are too close and that monkey there looks like he is about to attack you Great times,PunkRockGuitarTabs,16210166610,2

gy2o2z0,nc0yya,Travelled to China a few year back with a tour group Two surprising things: 1) they learned all of their sales tactics (we went to multiple shops each day where we were presented with a sales pitch- government shops subsidized the tour so this was unavoidable) from American infomercials Was probably one of the funniest things about the trip At one we were presented with "if you buy in the next 10 minutes ______!" Followed by "but wait! the first 3 people to sign up for this package will get free shipping!" followed by "if raise your hand to order in the next 10 seconds we will double the offer!" I was literally wheezing from laughing so hard in the middle of the sales pitch which was probably incredibly rude but  2) We toured Tiananmen Square where in 1989 troops killed a bunch of college student protestors While we were walking on the sidewalk around it my dad asked the tour guide if this was where the protests happened She got this look of horror on her face and very sharply told him to be quiet and that we couldnt talk about that Later when we were on the tour bus she explained that we were not allowed to talk about anything political but that yes that is where the protests happened She explained at some point on the trip that China is communist and that the people feel freer than ever because they are not literally owned by an emperor any more,Dlaffoon0,16209763540,5

At the same time it made Constantinople much more stable which led to the rise of the Byzantine Empire Christianity eventually led to the creation of Islam Thanks to the Byzantine upkeep of eastern Roman roads and trade routes it gave Islam an easy way to spread quickly leading to the Moorish invasion of Europe which of course led to the multiple Crusades Plus the Christian pope of Alexandria had the last remaining bit of the Library of Alexandria destroyed in the 4th century So he created the conditions that led to: -Rise of the 2 largest religions -Eventual downfall of Roman Empire and loss of its tech for centuries -The Dark Ages Inquisitions Crusades PLUS theres the butterfly effect of things that we couldnt possibly know and hypothesize at best The Americas Trans-Atlantic slave trade Dutch East India Co English expansion for centuries etc This one guy single handedly changed the direction the world was going in and arguably led to the stagnation of mankind,ChuckoRuckus,16286077690,3

ht0q5gx,s5m4up,Our town isnt small compared to most folks on here but there are less than 10000 of us Its found a bit north of a large and long highway that runs 300 miles through Virginia part of US Route 60 Most who live here make their living working with their hands farmers mechanics and the occasional businessman who trades the trek into Richmond for the cheap housing Currently there is a very prosperous logger who owns a good portion of undeveloped land throughout the county For a bit of scale on the size my house sat next to a portion of the logging land Some miles down the road was a road that divided this portion from the rest about 80 to 100 acres in total between our house and that road On the other side of that tiny road was another 800 acre stretch of land that he was planning on logging as well So all in all he had at about 900 acres ready to be logged quite possibly more as if stretched back into a part of the county unreachable by road and Im not keen on trespassing where everyone and there mother has a gun(The logging occurred when I was still in middle school so I dont have exact measurements take this with a grain of salt) He logged that land for a good while up until I was a junior in highschool I was a bit sad when it started being a kid and all If you drove by it on just the right night the moon would peak out just above and light up the edge Youd be greeted with this eerily beautiful view of nature I felt something deep for those small woods but its just trees and theyll be back one day when Im long gone Funnily enough accidents went down once they logged it so I guess I wasnt the only one whod been staring No one in town really minded the logging It was his property and he wasnt bothering no one What they were weary of was what would come after A lot of people were scared of new housing an influx of outsiders turning the quiet country into a loud suburb I never minded that idea though All those new people maybe some company would finally see reason to bring in broadband to the area And so people waited to see what would happen And waited And waited until it all just fell into the back of their minds Well imagine the shock when everyone in town gets the same thing in the mail that day A crisp white letter with bold red ink stamped by the local government I remember seeing and think it looked important as my dad went through the mail A few minutes later I heard a loud "What in the Sam Fuck" from the kitchen What was in the letter was a plan that called for the creation of a solar farm by a brand new LLC and an invitation to a public hearings that were to occur a few weeks before the project began Now for context on why people got a bit angry In 2019 the county came up with a long term plan for what the town would look like in two to three decades It included a list of objectives and what people should generally expect to happen Nowhere on there was there talk of the creation of a solar plant right next to peoples houses And this was no regular solar plant either Remember how there were over 900 acres of logged land Well 927 acres were to be used for the solar plant and this was already next to a 160 acre solar farmFor reference its recommended that plants never exceed 500 acres The logger and the LLC were also engaged in some very questionable behavior regarding zoning They knew that trying to rezone the property would most likely get rejected because of the size of the property So they instead applied for a Conditional-Use-Permit which would let them use the land however they see fit even if it did not comply with the current zoning ordinance A small part of it would also be built on a few acres of state park grounds disrupting wildlife and migration patterns During one of the hearings a ecologist came forward with findings on how that this would really fuck with the park and the animal population Most people who were upset werent upset because it was a solar plant but because it was a massive project that the company was trying to slip through the bureaucracy fast enough that no one wouldve known what was happening until it was too late The board of supervisors were also bought along with the promise that this farm would make the county a lot of money which somewhat shows because they granted the permit 5-0 It also doesnt look well that they never told the public until days before they happened So to the people of town it felt like the county and the company were conspiring against them Just so no one claims Im some far right extremist who thinks solar farms are secretly brain washing people or whatever I think solar farms are cool and a good way for clean energy,RandomHuman018,16424113230,3

ht2ormt,s5m4up,There was a tiny bar here that got out of control popular The owner was a total douche bro but no one really knew it He kept expanding the size of the bar way past what he was zoned for (which the patrons did not know) It was a dog friendly bar as it was mostly outside and there was a small waterfront They eventually built a little stage and had bands and food trucks It was super fun honestly Then the local neighborhood right next to the bar started to complain about noise And dog shit And parking Basically the bar patrons grew very disrespectful toward the bar neighbors and the neighbors were not having it Heres where it gets interesting: the guy who ran the bar started having a meltdown about it Social media posts about how he was getting "fisted" by the neighbors Characterizing all the neighbors as a bunch of "Karens and chads" (his words) Come to find out!!! That nearby neighborhood? It is a historically Black community full of elderly Black families who have lived in those homes for generations This is the American South we are talking about so some of these homes have been owned by these families LITERALLY SINCE SLAVERY WAS ABOLISHED And the bar owner and crowd you guessed it super duper white Come to find out it wasnt just noise complaints - the bar owner would rile up his customers complaining about the neighbors and the drunken bar goers would PUT DOG SHIT IN THESE PEOPLES MAILBOXES!!!! Someone in the neighborhood had an (adult) son who is a lawyer He is kickass and he basically just alerted the local government about the bar owner not complying with zoning laws The local government gave the owner a chance to rectify the situation but he just basically threw a tantrum posted about how everyone was out to get him then shut down the bar So in the end it is a success story for the neighborhood!

So I put a 3 x 5 sign up in my window advertising a fictional adult superstore Within 12 hours I was in my parking lot explaining to the mayor and four police officers why I wasnt going to take the sign down The city passed a new ordinance (also without following the required legal procedures) making the advertising of an adult business within the city limits illegal Not operating a store I understand zoning laws but simply having a sign up They cited me and I ended up going to court where the judge told me I had to take the sign down despite providing the multiple precedent cases from all levels of US government identifying the ordinance as unconstitutional I ended up taking the sign down to avoid a 25000 / day fine but it still pisses me off,jonrog,16423848940,1

Seems like a PR no brainer to memorialize them as heroes Im not saying these passengers werent heroes either Im sure they DID fight back and nothing changes that reality But if neither handling of the post-crash situation changes the overall outcome which scenario is more palatable to the American people? 1 The Passengers Patriotic Suicide 2 The Government Shooting Them Down,tripn4days,16233008190,32

Its also how you get people who have more money than they can ever realistically hope to spend refusing to share even the tiniest amount of it to the government so it can be used to uplift the lives of their fellow man And before anyone says "but private charity!" theyre doing it to reduce taxes and the way that their donations are set up makes it so that they can simply have the cash sit in a fund without actually donating it for years All this isnt to mention that the amount theyre donating is pennies to them Itd be like a millionaire donating a hundred dollars When you ok and encourage greed through a capitalist economic system that goes unregulated as well as hyper individualism to the degree we have in America youll get greedy people who frankly dont give a shit about anyone else (Kind of important when you want to change things for the better an empathetic populace *will care* an apathetic one wont) In addition this is also what gets thousands of people killed We got dragged into Iraq because we as a nation are like a crack addict except our drug of choice is profit Hundreds of thousands of Americans died in *the* worst response to COVID of any developed or developing nations because so many people just thought that they were above lockdown rules For perspective Vietnam did better when it has a GDP thats 20% of the US For more perspective our response was so bad that we have more cases than China a nation *with more people than the North American and European continents combined* Not per capita ***Total***,Epicn3wb,16289633700,1

h9v9dcd,p6qb47,**Long** (if you want to skip to where "supernatural event is scroll down to the  break in the words) When I was 17 years old I had just recently graduated and was working at our local movie rental store I had an extreme pain in my stomach that started around 6pm but since I worked alone I couldnt sneak off to the restroom As soon as 10pm rolled around I closed up the store and walked home as quickly as I could (only lived half a mile from the store) I went to the restroom with no relief The pain continued to get worse and worse I knocked on the door to my parents room and whispered to my mom that I was in a lot of pain As a mom being woken up in the middle of the night she whispered back "go to the bathroom and try to lay down" I didnt want to bother them anymore so I decided to take a cold shower because of how hot I was getting All I remember was waking up in the shower slumped over the side walls of the bathtub I just remember the pain was unlike anything I had ever felt before (I have broken my femur before and it was leagues beyond that) I crawled out of the tub and pulled myself across the floor soaking wet I crawled to my parents room and mustered all the strength I had to lift my arm to hit their door I faded out after that I woke up with my dad carrying me into the hospital (I am 6ft 3in so quite the task for him!) My memories of the events afterwards are spotty but I remember lying on a hospital bed hearing a doctor exclaiming to a nurse and my dad that my appendix had ruptured hours ago and I was going septic They were going to prep me for immediate surgery  They did a straight injection of an extremely high dose of liquid morphine and I remember the instant that it entered my body The best way I can explain it is pure serenity The worst pain I had ever endured melted away and I had no feeling in my entire body Time quite literally slowed down I honestly thought I had died and this my body allowing me to let go of all the pain All that I remember next was opening my eyes and seeing myself lying in the hospital bed I was looking down on myself; eyes closed lying in the bed lifeless head tilted to the side I remember the TV was on in the room and it was a sitcom playing quietly I saw my parents talking to each other (I guess my mom had arrived while I was out) My dad was explaining to my mom how the hospital was giving him issues with their insurance and how there shouldnt be issues with it since he worked for the government and it is accepted nationally My mom was telling my dad how bad she felt for not waking up and helping me the first time I knocked and my dad was comforting her They continued their conversation and then sat and held hands quietly I remember sitting down in the chair next to them none of us talking and me shutting my eyes because I felt so tired When I opened my eyes I was lying in the hospital bed back where I had been for the last 17 years in my own body My mom and dad werent in the room but a nurse was in the corner typing on the computer She noticed me stirring and left the room My parents soon entered with her and my mom and dad both began checking on me Oddly enough my first question to my dad was "are they going to take our insurance or are they still giving you trouble?" My dads eyebrows furrowed together; he turned to look at my mom with one eyebrow raised and she had a very similar confused look on her face He looked back at me and said "what did you just say?" I replied "you guys were talking about how the hospital was giving you issues with our insurance?" My mom and dad just blankly stared at me which made me feel uncomfortable I awkwardly decided to break the silence and I just grabbed my moms hand and said "mom Im not mad at you you didnt know when I knocked what was going on and neither did I!" A tear rolled out of her eye and her gaze shifted back to my dad; her mouth was open as the tear rolled down her cheek and ran along the edge of her open mouth No words came out of her mouth though My dad grabbed my moms hand and looked at me and in a confused and questioning reply said "(my name) how do you know about the insurance issue? Was one of the doctors talking about it?" Me being even more confused now replied "No you were sitting with mom and you guys were talking about it? Mom said she felt bad about not helping? You guys were just talking about it?" My dad quietly replied "(my name) we havent been in here since they took you for surgery" "Your mom and I have been in the lobby down the hall for the last five hours Theres no way you would have heard us talking about that" As soon as he finished his last words the doctor walked into the room and began talking to my parents It was never brought up again between any of us and I think about it often; over a decade later,ihasfirecape,16296025800,23

gv54tu2,mttmmx,Saudi Arabia: Whoo boy there are so many Where to begin? 1) Saudis are filthy rich and everyone has oil money Saudi Arabia just like any country has people who are rich people who are poor and everything in between We rank #54 in median wealth per adult which means the average person in Saudi Arabia is no richer than the average person in Japan China or the West Oil revenue goes directly to the government and citizens used to see the benefits in the form of universal services (like healthcare and education) subsidies on goods (like gasoline and staple foods) and little to no taxes But now that the oil market has been in steady decline for the past decade a lot of services are being privatized subsidies are being removed new taxes are being waged and unemployment is at an all-time high 2) Saudi Arabia is a desert with tents and camels While a large portion of Saudi Arabia is desert we also have mountainous regions in the west and south most famously the Hijaz mountains and coastal plains on the east and west like Tihama (It even snows on the mountain tops!) There are no more wandering bedouins as everyone lives in settled homes People still go camping in tents to preserve tradition Camels are very expensive to own and theyre not a common sight in or around cities 3) Saudis are terrorists or terrorist-sympathizers Americans seem to especially believe this I think because Bin Laden was born and raised in Saudi Arabia The fact is Bin Laden had been a wanted criminal fugitive since the 90s who for various socio-political reasons managed to persuade younger more gullible people from Saudi Arabia and other countries to follow him to Afghanistan where he orchestrated the tragic 9/11 attacks In fact Saudi Arabia itself has been the target of multiple terrorist bombings by Al-Qaeda in 2003-2004 (Riyadh Khobar Yanbu) and later ISIL in 2015 (Qatif Damman Abha) I see a lot of comments on reddit about how the US "should have bombed the Saudis" and it makes me upset,StrawberrySheikh,16188751850,3

gv3cfpq,mttmmx,a lot of people believe that the British were the most morallymcorrupt imperial power because we were the biggest this simply isnt true whIle we did some really shitty stuff to places like ireland we for the most part let countries have their own freedoms especially compared to what the French and Spanish empires were like for example when Sudan was invaded it was ruled over by only 15 civil servants wheras othere empires would create a completely new government with hundreds of members of Parliament and in 1833 Britain let go of the slave trade even though it was still making them a large profit and then started spending thousands on trying to stop the transatlantic slave trade even ghandi praised the british empire stating that the best type of government is one that governs less and by that logic the british empire is the best type of government but the biggest sign that this isnt the case comes in the 1940 after germany invaded france the british empire stood as the last remaining force against the nazis and as britain refused to surrender hitler started and invasion of britainwhere 10000 german aircraft fought against 1500 british aircraft in a 3 month longinvasion attempt that resulted in 5000 casualties and 4000 deaths this was undoubtedly the turning point of the war and what many believe to be the reason that the allies won and after everything that the british empire had done for the world britain chose to give it all up claiming that the age of empires was over and setting up the commonwealth none of this is to say that the british empire was good it wasnt especially before 1833 and especially in places like ireland but it did more than the spanish empire more than the french empire more than the dutch or the portugese and in the 20th century it did more than anyone ever could,britishredditors,16188468920,2

gv40w3q,mttmmx,Oh boy where do I even begin? Im from Denmark And BOY do the US just loooooove to bring up Denmark First of Bernie! We are NOT a bloody socialist country! We are CAPITALIST with a social security network But we are actually HEAVILY supportive of people starting private buisness and being entreprenours because we know thats where our tax pool comes from And we NEED that tax pool to pay for our security network! If we didnt have a healty enviroment for private buisnesss we wouldnt have money to pay for social security! Our free universities yes technically we have free universities But they do NOT work the way they think they do Bascially the best way to think of them is that they are an INVESTMENT made by government They look at our numbers and say "In eight years we need this many new doctors and this many new engineers and this many so on and so on" And then they crunch the numbers and THOSE are the exact number of students they will pay for on each course So the number of free spots are limited And well We dont need people who studies gender theories they are not a net benefit So the government arent paying for that shit You CAN study it you can go to any foreign country and study what you want But then you have to pay for that The government only pays for what they think will be a net benefit to our society after the education has been finished and in limited numbers And potential students will fight for those spots Based on grades and knowledge! On MERIT! And I do like that system cause it does mean that truly even if you are a from a poor family If you are clever and can get the grades you can indeed become a doctor But you aint getting free paces because of skin color We cant afford "Representation" we need those who are of a net benefit to our society Otherwise We cant afford social security! At all! Also We have a HUGE focus on health and making people eat healthy and not be obese because guess what A good way to SAFE money on health care and hospitals are by preventing people from getting preventable diseases Diseases that would never have happened if you werent obese in the first place So yeah! I love my country! That this works is amazing But it only works because of all of these things All of these American "Progressive" ideas would DESTROY our social security You cant have both guys Im sorry no im not Im not sorry You cant Edit: People love saying that if Alexandria Orcazio Cortez was Danish she would be considered a moderate njah fam If she was Danish she would be considered insane,TheDorkyDane,16188571440,2

hhjuutg,qcqv9v,Years ago I was in top level government job and wanted to leave I was informed that a lobbyist wanted to open a branch of his firm in the capital and was looking for someone with exactly my profile to be head of the branch I met with him and got uncomfortable really fucking fast The man had no idea what he was talking about setting expectations that were not plausible in the slightest In my experience people in that line of work that have that much of a disconnect with reality tend to be  fixers  instead of legitimate lobbyist as in instead of putting the work in to convince the government of their objectives they do illegal things to buy their way in I politely declined the job offer A year or two later I had become head of a powerful business network/lobbying institution A few weeks after my hiring had been announced in the newspapers I was contacted again by that man He also had changed jobs and was now head of some sort of business school for high ranking public officials in local administrations that was funded near entirely by his political contacts (school that coincidentally had the same initials as him) He wanted desperately to sign a contract with us for cooperation I got what three to five messages a week on his part for two months ? I said no politely at first but quite firmly the more he insisted There was just something that felt off with his insistence especially considering his local political contacts already managed to bully my members in the place he had his school set up in into signing a contract with him a contract that they (wisely) managed to prevent from having any legal value whatsoever The contract he was proposing had no added value be it for my workplace or his except the ability to make a press release about it Note by the way that a lot of my members actually provided the same services as he did so we would basically be helping a concurrent Understanding that my door was closed he called the chair of my board and tried to convince her using the same tactics When she told me I advised her to redirect any new inquiries from him to me and refuse to talk with him Thats when I got news from my aunt See my aunt was at the time one of the highest ranking public servants in the State and was approached too She had the same feeling as I did and blocked him out but that got her curious She discreetly looked into the inner workings of his business and his accounting She was not pleased with what she discovered to say the least Word quickly got around to stay the fuck away from that man My father who is the owner of one of the biggest newspaper of the place began to investigate and was quietly notified by the police to back off A year later the man was arrested The formation he was supposedly providing his students never existed Only one class ever graduated He took millions from his school to funnel into his failing business with whom he had made the school sign a contract for paid services (a HUGE legal no-no) And thats without talking about the wages he took from the school that were unheard of for a school of that size Quickly it appeared that the school mainly served as a way for high ranking people to network together and go on  teaching trips  in foreign countries The police arrested a lot of high ranking public officials that funded him discovering payouts or in some cases sexual relationships between them and some of the workers of the school (which is illegal in my country: if you have a  personal interest  in a place you cant decide anything related to that place) The trial is impending TLDR: years ago I declined a job offer by a man I immediately distrusted Some times later he tried to bully me in my new job to help him out in his new business I refused A year or two later he got arrested for corruption and fraud,MrBlackTie,16348570750,6

Human trafficking (hopefully the correct term) He will dress up in a suit/formal wear and look for women and girls from poor families in China and impersonate as an official from my country and offer them job opportunities He will then give them falsified documents and then theyll fly to my country which they will be let in because he is in cahoots with some officials of rank in the immigration When these girls arrive in Malaysia what were their jobs? Not waitresses or masseurs but forced into prostitution or sold as cheap labour He has threatened to send his own children to Australia and sell them off as coolies Also claimed to have connections with those on the legal and illegal side in the country Tried several times to get my uncle to invest in a business with him but in reality just wants to scam him He also constantly threatens his own parents by saying he wont provide for his family if his parents dont give him money He ran to Australia to hide when my government begin clamping down on corrupt immigration officers and made arrests and when it died down he came back Nothing can be done because hes still "protected" by some corrupt officials here My dads not perfect he describes his kids as "investment" and only is nice to me when he needs my help but Id rather take that compared to having a criminal as my parent,totallynicehedgehog,16348353220,3
hhjle89,qcqv9v,I was interviewing for 2 different jobs One for a small startup ~30 employees The other for a more established company Part of the startups interview process included a 2 HOUR deep dive on my past work experiences where they literally made me take a walk down memory lane and answer all these questions about all my past jobs name my managers and colleagues and describe all my highs and lows Okay Odd and deeply personal in some ways But I went with it Overall both sets of interviews with both companies went really well and we moved on to the references stage The startup proceeds to ask for 6 references naming EXACTLY WHO they wanted to speak to (including my manager at the time) - the people theyd wanted me to name and talk about about during my 2 hour deep dive interview Okay super weird and annoying that they wanted me to reach out to people I hadnt seen in 7 years so they could talk to them But fine I mostly did it- replacing some references with others eg my manager All my references end up mentioning how half the call was spent talking about me while the other half was the startup trying to poach my references Jesus wtf? I eventually got both offers and started weighing the pros and cons to make my decision A day or so after the startup tells me about my offer they send me an email: "Thought wed send some Friday cheer your way :)" with an attachment I open the attachment Its a zoom screenshot with everyone I interviewed in the frame each of their hands are forming a different shape which I finally realize are letters - meant to be spelling out my name Alrighhhhhht then A day later Im talking to my partner and making dinner when my phone rings I dont recognize the number so I joke that its probably one of those robot calls claiming that I owe the government money - and I pick it up Its the startup CEO calling me at 8pm asking if I have any questions or want to talk things out to help with my decision Cool cool cool At this point this company seems to be so invested in getting me to take the job and a part of me truly feels like I owe it to them to say yes But I end up taking the other offer after going through lots of deliberation pros and cons A week later one of the employees who interviewed me reaches out to me on LinkedIn They tell me theyd just left the company We connect and set up a call - Im so curious why they left when they seemed so happy During the call they proceed to lay out how toxic the work environment was and how it took everything in them to not let that show during the interview Everyone worked till at least 7pm each day and this particular person would barely break for dinner before they had to be back in front of the screen The CEO had everyones phone number "just in case" and it wasnt uncommon for then to call employees at 10pm 11pm because of an "emergency" that "just couldnt wait till the next day" They would discourage people from going out of the office for lunch (pre-pandemic days) because "what if other people end up wanting to leave the office too?" If anyone complained about being overworked they were gaslit or reminded that "this is a startup" They had mandatory "happy hours" on Friday that STARTED at 5pm went till 7pm after which people would continue working to wrap up for the week If anyone wanted to take time off theyd be reminded that "this is a startup" or accused of not caring about their teammates or told that it was too short notice Everything was urgent all the time And anyone who worked overtime weekends or during vacation or holidays would be propped up and given kudos So yeah I guess saying no was the best decision I had made in while?,Agitated_Society7853,16348527810,3

hhk0354,qcqv9v,My father is senior level civil engineer in NYC He was working as an SVP for a mid size consulting firm (~600 employees) when he had city investigators show up because he was being accused of having tried to reach out to the NYC dept of transportation for insider info on upcoming contracts The reality is my father had worked in the DOT for 20 years before going into consulting & had just been speaking to a secretary or office engineer he had hired while there about how their life was going non business But since he used the office phone accusations were made by others he had a tabloid article written about him about NYC engineering corruption lol (my dad wrote the writer an email asking her if she would like to actually speak to him so she can be informed & retract her bunk story She obviously never responded) His boss didnt like the negative attention and basically started distancing from my father My father had to go to a deposition where he successfully proved that he was never talking about anything business related but simply having a personal conversation with a personal relationship But because things became so awkward at work my dad told his boss that hell resign if it makes things easier for them and my father said his boss didnt push back against that at all and just said yes I think that hurt my father more than anything considering this boss was the guy who convinced my father leave his government tenured position as Deputy Commissioner and come work in Consulting in the first place and now hes leaving him out to dry Well the joke is on them because my fathers name was cleared and he ended up at a much larger consulting firm (~4k employees) & ended up one of the main construction managers on the Mario Cuomo Bridge which was the largest civil engineering contract New York City has had in the past like 50 years And his old company ended up getting raided by the FBI because it turns out my dads old boss had illegally owned two other construction firms on the side under the names of his friends when he was really the one in bankrolling it the whole time And he also was having all his employees get $500 donations to the mayors when he was running for office in order to circumvent the dollar limit that one person could give and then the CEO was just paying that $500 back to all the employees as year end bonuses So this CEO was able to give tens of thousands of dollars in donations should the marriage even though youre only allowed to give $500 or something And then they found out he had a mole in the government office who was leaking major government contracts so that this eeo could develop better proposals faster So it turns out this guy was corrupt as f*** and he didnt want to protect my father who was clean because he didnt want any of the extra attention on his Shady back dealings So his s*** fell apart while my fathers career went to the most successful places its ever been,Through_Night,16348595600,2
hieodvc,qcqv9v,When I was around 5 years old I visited my 40 year old house in another country and there was this light switch that would shock me a little whenever I pressed on it and I did it a lot as it felt oddly good Keep in mind the country I visit every summer is poor and it had a bad government so the electricity wasnt always stable and there were black outs The house also wasnt nearly as fixed up and renovated as it is now However one peculiar day I was wearing something metal on my hand and I went for my daily routine of nearly killing my self and I was on my way to touch the light switch at the bottom of the stairs My nanny spotted me and my finger was a centimetre away from touching the light switch She save my life by stopping me Needless to say I never did it again with metal I did it a few more times before they removed the wall and added a room Honestly I still miss it to this day because it was a mayor part of my child hood,Legendarystuff16,16354430210,2
hhjizk2,qcqv9v,I have a good one for your Im an internationally renowned whisteblower from the USA but relatively unknown in my country because its ran by a bunch of criminals I blew the whistle on the US military drone program in 2012 December 21st actually Though the article in Der Spiegel came out on the 17th the daily mail and business insider printed a tabloid piece that mistranslated the German piece Im 2015 I was given the Whistleblower Award by the German Federation of Scientists and Lawyers Against Nuclear Arms The same award that was given to Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning I however didnt release anything new I simply connected the dots that the government already had out there I testified in German parliament of the role of Ramstein AFB in the illegal drone war and surveillance of world citizens I also spoke at the United Nations as well as I was one of two Americans who showed up to a council to determine international law of robotic and autonomous warfare During this time one of the officers who came into the drone program after I left and whose wife is a lawyer for Raytheon and Johnson & Johnson started stalking me and making YouTube videos claiming that I am a paedophile death cult leader who used the souls of the people I killed to give me supernatural powers This dude is literally insane Fast forward to Autumn 2019 I start going to my local city council meetings because the mayor and council got caught red handed using a thing called tax increment financing for pet projects as well as using their power to ruin the lives of anyone who came to speak against the actions of the elected officials A few veteran friends and local once middle class did our research and went to battle Being my background as it was I tried to get through to them But one day I was telling a story and none of them were paying attention so I used my staff sergeant voice Meeting was adjourned and a few weeks later I decided that what we were doing was wasting time and we needed to go up the chain of command Late January 2020 there is a warrant out for my arrest February 11th I turn myself in to the police and spend the next 30 days in jail part of it in isolation The charges were "threats and intimidation of a public official" They put my bail at $100k twice the legal limit under the Montana state constitution Mind you this last Monday a man was caught having raped and assaulted a woman nearly to death and was given a $50k bail I got out the day the lockdown happened My mother gave up her retirement But you wanna know where all my support was? They fled to the hills All those people that I spoke to shared my story with silent I had to fight this by myself with no money Public defence When I was released I was not on parole or had any tracking device I had cops follow me everywhere Once I had an animal control lady chase me claiming that my dog attacked a deer and that she had proof She called the cops on me and I almost got into a fight 3v1 over her Karen bullshit Every 2 months the prosecution came to me with a deal for a lesser offense I told him he could go fuck himself Oh the evidence that the State brought against me?

hhifdag,qcqv9v,I managed a certain "getaway" place for a certain very exclusive club of older men Occasionally they would have a guest (non-member) join them for a few days Often this guest would be someone of public prominence in the media or business or government or whatever So one time I was prepping the place which in part involved setting up their rooms which itself involved placing a bath towel on their bed It was going to be a full weekend so I was running low on towels Most towels are a uniform theme color but sometimes I get down to the stragglers which can be anything The last room Im setting up will be occupied by a guest who happens to be a black man I complete the setup by placing on his bed not a nice theme-colored towel but rather an older and much less impressive  black towel I turned around and got about ten feet away before it hit me and suddenly I had an image of these guys in the showers the next morning: all the white members with their nice big fluffy theme-colored towels and our black guest with his second-string black towel Stopped dead in my tracks returned to correct the situation then sat for a while and pondered how close I came to letting that nightmare scenario happen,LightenUpPhrancis,16348356670,1
hhir3zg,qcqv9v,I was touring a college about two years ago and ended up in the health and safety building which just so happened to be the building I would primarily be in based upon my interest of study (nursing) I got to talking to the head teacher of the nursing department Its important to mention that this college operated way differently than most as there was only one teacher per department which is possible because of how small the school is Anyways the teacher was SUPER nice and helpful and I thought at that moment I would decide to go there Flash forward a month later and Im going down to the college to conduct an interview with the head of admissions Although I was already accepted I was meeting with the head of admissions to confirm my acceptance and to fill out paperwork I decided to swing by the health and safety building again to tell the teacher that Ill be seeing him a lot more and that Im excited to start studying under him This is when it gets interesting: The teacher left his job because he got an amazing job offer at another university I got to talking to the new teacher and THE FIRST thing he says to me is "did you know the moon landing covid and all STDs are fake?" I laughed because I thought "this guys the head of nursing at a university Surely hes joking" He then told me to "shut the hell up" and went on this 20 minute rant about masks the government and how his wife left him I dont mind people having personal beliefs You cant believe in whatever you want but as long as your a good person your good in my book however; this guy just came across rude and demeaning It totally turned me off from the university I ended up going into the admissions office and filed a formal complaint against the teacher I left and now attend a WAY better university If I didnt swing by that building I wouldve been in a WAY different scenario,Drinking-Ducks,16348403950,1
