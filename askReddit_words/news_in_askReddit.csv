gvv0h5s,myeqin,In a nursing home I might actually live there just because their is a variety of residents If 30 people or 100 people live there I can always duck the jerks and the mean people and kick it with people that appreciate me being me Im currently in my 30s living with my grandmother and even though its just us in the house it can really drain the life out of you when your being talked to about a funny commercial or a product on QVC through the bathroom door as youre talking a shit It can be really tough depending on the persons needs and style of communication Do they have any hobbies? Are they excited to try new things? Do they just watch the news and cuss at the president? Id put in a request for transfer so fast if all the residents where super controlling picky and mean But I will say I love the idea as a whole It seems like a good way to give back to people in need and with the ever rising housing costs it seems like a win win You just need the right attitude going in Once you make friends with folks and have a connection you better believe theyll call you at 3am to open a pickle jar but hey a friend in need,donttalktomeyoufuck,16193862110,1

gvv8tvn,myeqin,I worked in a nursing home Its horrible Rent free doesnt make something desirable in any way Its on par with living in a shelter Thats rent free too Id rather have my own place and do visits So no I wouldnt but its not because I wouldnt want to hang with the elderly its because those places are terrible unless its a super expensive one which most cannot afford The best part of the job was hanging out with them but it was heart breaking and my job was low level so I couldnt make much of a difference I felt The was a sweet lady named pearl who just an angel Her son stole her money and they sent her to that place that was absolutely a garbage place The staff were horrible there People got ignored I had been a caregiver in another state but didnt have licensing so while waiting for the next class I was a janitor and I wasnt allowed to help people People who needed help with buttons or someone just to talk not even medical stuff I got in trouble a few times for helping but staff would strait up ignore calls When pearl died her shitty son didnt even call on her birthday that was three days prior let alone visit when he lived close They were gonna throw out her belongings She had all these cards from her husband and friend both who were dead so I saved them I had to be the one to clean up her room and throw all her precious stuff out because her garbage son didnt want or even look at any of it He did have them save her wedding ring tho He convinced her to sign over her assets to him so he could sell her house to get her care Her husband was some fancy Hollywood guy who worked with celebs in the 40s and she actually was well off but he put her in the shittiest cheapest place possible and bought himself a house and boat with the money This place literally had 4 residents to a bathroom It was mostly for medicaid users and impoverished elderly so the quality is terrible No one deserves that but she could have bought herself a nice place It was totally messed up She would always say if her husband knew what her son did he would roll in his grave Never brought the grandkids by to visit or nothing Broke my heart I legit got in trouble one time for helping a woman who had her shirt stuck on her head because she called for help and no one came so she did it herself and got stuck till I found her They left people in urine for way too long Another lady fell and stayed on the floor for hours Her face was all super bruised and then she slept for three days before dying There was also an old dude who super sweet but come to find out he was actually a murderer and they arrested him and he went to court n stuff Pretty sure he killed his wife too It was in the news and stuff He was a total flirt and super sweet so that was a shock,waydacookiecrumbles,16193903710,1
gvv9w5u,myeqin,This exists in Sweden known as the Sllbo Project and here is one link below I heard about this through BBC Worldservice who later did a follow-up program to see how they were coping with the pandemic since the premise of their community is social interaction And to answer your question YES! when I was in the younger age range and living across the country from family though I doubt I would have had the wisdom to try it Knowing about an example like this would help!

gvvej34,myeqin,Aaaabsolutely Already did basically just that for most of July 17- September 18 My grandmother lived in a retirement home thats part of a chain of retirement homes and they had a few spare rooms for residents to stay in who were traveling (ie she could leave the home in Dallas and while traveling to Boulder stay a night in one of the spare rooms at the home in OKC) Anyway I was fresh out of college very sociable and needed a place to stay while I figured my logistics out (I was working as an HR temp for three days a week and building sets for a theater in Dallas in the evenings so I was less a vagrant and more just a young dude with a lot of free time during the days) Id done some work for the manager of that retirement home when I was in high school and I was there to eat with my grandmother and her friends in their big dining hall for dinner at least four nights a week so the owner offered to let me stay in one of their spare rooms if I helped the residents with their furniture-moving needs ran their bingo games for them on Tuesday and Thursdays and ran their movie nights The furniture-moving turned into a lot of chatting while I moved couches around and some of the folks whose spouses had already passed would definitely ask me to help them move furniture just to have someone to talk to I liked it a lot the old folks are full of stories and often have nobody to tell them to One old man worked for GMs defense division back in the day and helped design the M1 Abrams tank and he had a little wooden version of the tank on a plaque-stand that had his name and the teams name and was basically a thank-you-for-your-work gift from the company Another woman had been a dancer on Broadway back in the late 50s and early 60s and she had all these old newspaper clippings She eventually became a teacher in a town south of Houston and had some great stories from that time as well Unfortunately I havent been there in a little while I got a place of my own at the end of 2018 and kept visiting but then they locked down pretty hard back in March of 2020 and then my grandmother caught Covid and passed back in February so theres not much to take me back there now that theyre opening up again I hope theyre all well but I think that at least a handful of the folks I really liked there have passed in the last year,JamesEarlDavyJones,16193934530,1

h42hzrm,odkp21,I thought up the best way to troll my kids after death but then realized it was way too much work If any of you yahoos want to do it you are welcome to it Step 1 Regular passport photos with different hair styles facial hair names etc Step 2 Forge different passports from different countries They dont have to be great forgeries because no one would ideally see them for at least 30 years and who will know what a passport looked like back then? Also they will never be used as ids so I dont think its breaking the law Do check if you want to do this I am not a lawyer Step 3 The passports Hand gun and cash in different currencies a safe deposit box Step 4 When a major political uprising or societal issue appears in the news go put a stamp for that country in one of your passports for one or two weeks prior to the event Keep the passports in the safe deposit box Step 5 Leave the key to the box somewhere your kids will find when you die Step 6 Die Laugh all the way to hell,TacticalLeemur,16254369280,3

gxru9ci,n9jyqk,I used to do odd days here and there for a family friend who started his own business which became really successful Bear in mind I grew up with this guy he was a friend of my dads but like a big brother to me when I was a kid Every time I worked for him he would expect 110% out of me but not in an enthusiastic or encouraging way in an enforced slave labour kind of way The last time I did any work for him was about four or five years ago now He had just moved to a much bigger premises and needed the sign out the front re-doing; I worked for a sign business and had the ability to fit the vinyl myself for a bit of cash He proceeded to order the printed vinyl through the company I worked for after we went through a few designs (on my own time) We werent the cheapest but the quality of materials was above average It came to the Saturday when we agreed to meet to sort the sign I had already asked him about cleaning off the old vinyl as it was at least fifteen years old For anyone who hasnt tried to remove old vinyl its like peeling a million small bits of dried newspaper off of glass where it sticks and breaks up super brittle He assured me this had been sorted I get there and all he has done is get the sign off the wall nothing else Great start I make a start on it but I dont have any thinners as wasnt expecting to have to do this part of the job so I go to the nearest hardware store and pick up some supplies making sure to get the receipt to get the money back from him Two hours later and Im still cleaning the old vinyl off the sign while he complains about the price of the vinyl that he paid for He only decided to look around after hed paid realising that he could have saved a few quid bear in mind this guy is a millionaire by this point Not only does he berate me over the cost of our products he goes and pulls his own products out showing me the best he has to offer and how it only cost X from China Why do I give a fuck how much you pay for your products before putting a huge mark-up on them when selling them on? How is this in any way a comparison for your fuck up buying the first place you looked? I spent three or four hours in total cleaning this old sign up to re use it then fitting the new vinyl on the Saturday I had a window of about an hour on Sunday to help install the new sign on the building between visiting family and working my second job The minute I hesitated by text about being able to help the abuse and reverse psychology started It put me in a shit mood before my 7 hour shift and to top it off we parted ways with him saying After I paid X for the vinyl but Ive seen it elsewhere for Y how about you go back to your boss and ask for some money back and then well split the difference? The cunt didnt even pay me! I completely cut ties with him after that I told my dad about it and it made him see this guy in a different light one that he knew about but had never really witnessed before or chose not to A few months later my dad saw him and he asked how I was and why he hadnt heard from me and my dad bluntly replied because he thinks youre a cunt!

gxofw9l,n9jyqk,I was hired by a printing company to work on newsletters For some reason my first day I was given a newsletter on bow hunting to put together to be printed The color images were pretty graphic of dead animals One was a fawn shot through the neck with a boy of about nine dressed in hunting clothes trying to appear proud of killing the baby He looked like he wanted to cry Another photo was of a boar shot through the eye They cut her open and had the boar fetuses laying out on the ground It bothered me a lot I went to my boss and said I didnt want to work on that project He got pissed at me Said "I thought I hired a man not a sissy!" He asked me if I was queer? I went back to my station got my jacket and left The images still bother me The boys face also That was around 20 years ago,SomeNobodyInWNC,16206959650,108
gxqi20b,n9jyqk,Technically not quitting a job more like walking out of a scam It was a giant waste of a couple of days so Ill throw my story in here/ Circa 1992 when I was a college sophomore a friend of mine and I were invited to interview for a marketing position at a job fair on campus Day of the interview we went to the address which was empty office space above a strip mall in town Maybe 20 other people were there as well to interview I went in for the first interview which was with this college-aged student about my age It was like 30 years ago so its hard to remember but it was very low-key No though questions people skills type of stuff She was very sweet and bubbly After we all interviewed she comes back out of the "side office" and we found out who got second interviews which would be commencing immediately My friend wasnt called for a second interview but I was I told him Im more than happy to leave We both agreed something seemed really sketchy so at the very least hed stick around while I did this interview to find out the scoop So I go in This tine its a dude in his early 30s Although they were vague at the job fair and at the first interview I find out about the "job" Dude pulls out a set of kitchen knives The infamous Cutco knives and says Ill be selling these Im like what do you mean like in the mall or something? No its would be to family friends dormmates Classified ads in the newspaper (this was before the Web was a thing) Im sort of pissed at this point as he explains how he sells his knives but the kicker was that he said in order to "accept the position" I had to buy a set of "demo" knives myself for $150 (in 1992 thats like almost $300 in todays money) So I said no and just left I remember my buddy sitting there when I walked out of the room and telling him it was basically a pyramid scheme and that they probably saw me as a rube TL;DR - Wasted two days of my life pursuing/interviewing for a Cutco "job" without realizing it,SmokyDragonDish,16207450790,5
h3lxmno,n9jyqk,In college I was a bit of an IT guru working at a bowling alley since the hours were flexible and I was a full time student as well I got an offer to work at a business office as the IT/Networking Technician part time I interviewed twice got the job was told I would be basically keeping the computers up working addressing network issuesjust general IT work as needed in the mornings Came in on my first day and got shown to the copy room where I was instructed to make copies of newspaper articles that the president tore out of the paper Thought that was strange they never mentioned that in the interviews but whatever Then they took me into an office handed me a printed ledger in which I was to go through and highlight any errors and the book was huge I looked at my trainer and said "You sure you got the right guy? I was wired as an IT technician and was never told Id be doing any of this" She responded "Oh he should have told you! You will also get coffee for the president and handle phone calls & general office tasks" I said "Why didnt you just hire a secretary then?" She said "Well we needed an IT guy & a secretary but couldnt get both hires approved" So I did a long pause stared at the ledger for a minute and said "Yeah you should have been honest in the interviews and told me all of this ahead of time because I feel like this was a bait and switch of the position I was hired for Im not the guy you want I quit" I left right out of there and luckily my old job hadnt processed my termination yet called my old manager told him what happened and he was happy to have me back The hiring manager called me the next day asked me what happened and I told him and he was massively ticked off because he did hire me for IT only but apparently the president and his controller decided to hijack his new hire and try to make me their new secretary,dallased25,16250886710,6

gxq4hzi,n9jyqk,Took a job that was "sales with progression to management" being newly graduated it sounded like a good path I took the interview at a job fair at my small Midwestern college and the VP who touted his family of 5 stay at home wife because I make 600k a year lifestyle really liked me and offered to fly me out to their headquarters in Utah I had never been to Utah and I felt like if they are investing money in me to fly me out there they could be a great company and really interested in me I took the job Once I accepted it they bought me a plane ticket to Phoenix and said youll meet one of our field reps out there for your initial training Sounds good! I get to Phoenix and the company had a 7 bedroom AirBnB rented out for about 15 guys I have no problem sharing a bed with another guy but it was awkward being that none of us knew each other We all hung out the first night and played billiards and ordered pizza It was fine The following morning we were briefed on our "script" which consisted of going door to door to offer "free home security devices (door sensors window sensors and two external cameras) in exchange for signing up for a 2 year contract of the monitoring services which were wildly overpriced (something like $170/month) On my first day the leader went with me and signed an agreement with an older lady who already had a home security system and he basically tricked her into thinking we were with her current company and just there to give an upgrade He called the install tech who promptly came over and immediately switched all her technology over It all happened so fast Im not sure she was completely with it Later that day while going door to door on my own trying to make a sale I had a gun pulled on me at the front door of some random house I knocked on and was told "Ive got my home security right here you have 10 seconds to get the fuck out of here before I blow your head off" so I walked to the grocery store that was nearby and decided to get a snack and collect my thoughts While sitting on a bench outside the grocery store I got a call that a family member back home had been in a bad motorcycle accident I had to get home I called the leader and explained the gun situation and the family accident situation and said I had no problem buying my own ticket home but I had to leave today Maybe we could try again in the future but I have other things to deal with right now His reply was along the line of "if youre always going to be a quitter youll always be broke what happened to your goals of wanting to provide for your family and build a career with this epic company with super cool people and totally cool team names and team hats and gear you dont know what youre missing" I broke down and started crying because of all the different things Id just dealt with in the last 2 hours I took an Uber to the house which luckily was empty because everyone was out scamming old people gathered my belongings and told the Uber driver to wait He took me right to the airport and I flew home On the flight I decided Id never work for a company that I felt was that dishonest with its customer and lack that much empathy for their employees TLDR: had a gun pulled on me and got news of a bad accident in the family Boss says if you want to quit then youll never be successful K bye,ETdaExtraTerresticle,16207389330,3

I should probably wash my hands then?" He nodded stiffly and I penguined my way to the restroom and plopped down just in time for World War III to commence Once I felt I had reached the eye of the storm I rushed back out as he rushed at me and demanded "Where have you been???" Embarrassed and positive that I wouldnt physically last the night (nor would customers want me serving them if I could) I opted for the truth: "Ummm I have a really bad stomach and I dont think Im going to be able to hold it in all night if Im rushing around" His face flashed beat red and raising his finger to my face he growled "YOU need to decide right now whether youre committed to this company or not!!! Is it yes? Or is it No?" As if on command my stomach kindly informed me that I had "T-minus ten nine eight" seconds to find the embrace of those loving porcelain arms "Im sorry sir but my stomach has just informed me" I started as I kegeled my way back towards the toilet "that the answer is No" After that round subsided I left the restroom locked eyes with the man and pointed "Clean-up on aisle three" As I walked out I felt whatever that German word is that perfectly describes a simultaneous feeling of wonder and terror that comes with sticking it to the man as youre about to shit yourself And what an interesting feeling it is,TheMadPhilosophist,16207218290,6

h5eobqt,olgt7p,The husband was the son of a megapastor for a massive church chain He wasnt a bad guy at all and had different views than his family but understood that his familys reputation would depend on his wedding His parents paid for it and it ended up being a MASSIVE church function basically Traditional and very pretty but put a ton of pressure on the couple The wife was agnostic with pagan leanings lol She was nice and I was friends with her too but she did not deal with pressure and stress from his family well They certainly did NOT like her At all And made it obvious During the ceremony one of the phrases she had to repeat after the officiant was something to the effect of "I will obey and honor my husband" and essentially the whole thing talked about how subservient and obedient the wife should be lol My husband and I looked at each other then and made a face because that was SO not her And not their relationship in general If she was saying that in front of a crowd because of the pressure from his family we didnt want to think negatively but we hoped our gut feelings were wrong lol The couple ended up moving so husband could go to med school and they lived with his family for about a year in a state the wife had no friends or family or job in His family was downright nasty to her He was so busy with med school she was left alone with them It was a shitty situation for her and I really feel for her She reacted poorly herself and ended up being openly hostile to them and to her husband when he wouldnt agree to move back to where she wanted to live and they got divorced after around 4 years His grandma texted him when she heard the news something like "good we knew you would come to your senses" Now her husband is remarried to a "more christian" girl who his family likes I hope it is easier on her,LadySilvie,16264494830,215
h5gbzj2,olgt7p,Ha! My wedding was full of them From the start to the end Everything associated with me being married pointed to disaster Our wedding was on March 23rd if I remember right A couple of days before Valentines Day Marlene my soon to be mother-in-law called me asked if had purchased a ring set yet I asked her for what She replied that I was getting married in a month It was news to me There is this song that is traditionally played after the newlyweds say their vows I think it was the theme song for The Newlywed Game My in-laws had hired a DJ to do all the music for the wedding and the reception After we said our vows we started to walk down the aisle As we were walking the song hadnt played 2 bars when it started to slow down and stop Everyone laughed their asses off I looked at Valerie and said "Bad sign" Usually the bride and groom leave the reception to take off and enjoy their honeymoon At some point the guy who did the floral arrangements didnt think the party was lively enough so he dumped a few gallons of vodka in the punch bowls Valeries best friend had brought her boyfriend with her Also her mother had her best friend there The music was getting louder and then Vals friends boyfriend started to dance with her moms best friend Next thing you know they were on the floor peeling off their clothes and going at it on the middle of the dance floor while Vals best friend was standing there watching and crying As we walked the last few people to their cars and got others cabs we ended up cleaning this huge mess that was left and when we got to our destination we slept Marlene had gone cheap on the catering and had the caterers cook at her house After the wedding she told me me they made a huge mess out of her kitchen So she stopped payment on their check I came home from work a few months later and turned on the tube I heard the theme song for The Peoples Court come on I heard them say today was the wedding fiesta fiasco I walked by the TV as they were introducing the plaintiff and the defendant It was Marlene her husband Pat and poor Bob the floral arranger I rushed and grabbed a video tape and recorded the episode I found out later they had all smoked a joint before going on since Marlenes husband Pat was a big pothead Judge Wapner said something that made them all start laughing He got mad and told them not to laugh at him Since they were high they couldnt stop laughing so they lost I showed the tape to Val and she flipped out that I had recorded it After a year we were separating We had gone down to Del Mar to spend the weekend and told her that we should go to Mexico since we were so close and have some fun for the weekend She was excited We were in traffic going into TJ This kid came up to our car spit all over the windshield and scrubbed it with a squeegee She went into panic mode and said "I want to go home" I think we were married a year and a half I always think the only reason we were together was to have our son,mescalero1,16264756440,10

h5grmla,olgt7p,Heres a slightly different take on this TL/DR I invited a friend I hadnt met in person to my sisters wedding Thought guest was going to murder me with words before the day of the wedding ever came I invited an online friend that I hadnt ever met in person (but had talked to/video chatted with for years) to my sisters wedding in June (Yeah I know Id read tons of stories about the random person at the wedding who screws it up and still went ahead and did it anyway Well talk about that in a bit) She flew in a day earlier than we had planned- not that Im complaining it just threw all my plans out the window and I spent most of the weekend feeling completely off-kilter Originally she was flying in on Thursday evening I was going to work until noon on Thursday get my hair cut pick up my tux and pick her up at the airport then it was off to the hotel She messaged me Wednesday morning saying she was on her way to the airport and would update me in a bit I texted back confused saying I thought her flight was tomorrow She messaged back that she had gotten the days wrong and we decided to see if she could switch the tickets and come a day early Well she did It was a little extra $$$ but I didnt care because hey I really *really* like this girl and I wont complain about any extra time spent with her So I call and rent a hotel room for the night close to work fully intending to work the half day I had told my boss I would and then head to the hotel near the wedding venue afterwards I head to the airport after work hastily stopping and cleaning myself up/grabbing the bag I had packed and my costume for the rehearsal dinner I get there around 8pm and her flight doesnt get in until around 10pm so I wait and wait and wait some more at the -small "international" airport- that she was originally flying into which was an hour north from the hotel we were headed to for the evening I get a call "My one flight was delayed and I missed my connecting They want to send me to -airport that is another hour north of where you are Is that ok?" "Yeah Ill be there" "Ok itll be another two hours until I touch down there" So I wait for her original flight to land hoping I can at least grab her bag Well (duh) I cant So I trundle north another hour pick her up (finally) and let this woman who Ive only just met in person drive my brand new truck And I do mean new Normally I would have been freaking out but I trust her and she did great Shes one of the few people I would trust to drive my truck So we get to the hotel at like 1 or 2 am Im supposed to be to work so I halfheartedly set an alarm we get into bed And I totally dont wake up to my alarm because it was set to silent so I sleep until 10 At this point I dont care about work and we head out to get my tuxedo and her checked bag We drive back to -small "international" airport- and they tell us "Oh sorry we sent that back to -gigantic international airport- this morning and its now in -bigger regional airport where you picked her up last night-" So we drove back up there and finally got her bag Then we had to go and get my tux in a completely different town; one that would have made more sense if I was picking it up on my own but again SNAFU Now Im sure youre wondering "Wheres the not going to last moment?" Well that was us in the truck getting closer and closer to the hotel where well be spending the next few days when my idiot brain means I miss my weird exit-thing off the interstate (it looked like a service road intersecting an on/off ramp) and I ended up giving us what felt like another 30-ish miles on the turnpike since there wasnt anywhere (or any way) to turn around I thought for sure she was going to kill me- not because shes violent or anything far from it I just felt like absolute crap right then- wed been on the road/in airports/in stores for close to 8 hours already just that day and I felt absolutely horrible Good news though: we did eventually make it to the hotel she didnt kill me (allegedly) and the entire wedding/ceremony went off pretty much without a hitch She was the perfect guest as far as Im concerned My family all likes her an awful lot now and she even helped my mom when my mom got a bit too warm outside I could go into detail on the afterwards but whats the fun in that?

It was drizzling and it felt like a movie scene I was at the back incharge of paddling starboard I was enjoying the moment trying to keep my fear of deep water in check First few rapids went by and we did well but then one of the guides told us to prepare for a big one Half way through the big one the front of the raft came to a dead stop which caused the back end to go nearly vertical into the air Didnt really have anything to hold on to so I took a deep breath and fell into the water which was when the raft steadied itself on top of me So there I was under the raft water was a murky brown with bubbles of white pushing me around couldnt see past my elbows I can feel the raft on top of me against my helmet I try to push myself away but the currents were too strong and kept me under the raft My fingers slide over the ribbed belly of the raft Im kicking so hard that my left sandals strap snaps making it more difficult to thread water It felt like I was under for a long time long enough for me to contemplate how sad my mum would be when shed hear the news of my drowning I started to feel like I needed to gasp for air A few seconds later we went over a calm patch of water which allowed me to get away from the raft As my head broke the surface of the water I saw everyone just looking around the raft Someone spotted me and one of the guides in a single seater kayak placed his oar close to me to grab on After catching a breather I climbed back onto the raft and we went through a few more less eventful rapids thankfully Never told my mum about it though,DonutPrime,16257683230,2

h4vguop,og6dcv,About 3 years ago I should preface this by saying that at the time I was a secret opiate addict (prescription medication) and taking over 30 codeine tablets a day I also have POTS which is a heart condition one of the symptoms is light headedness and fainting Went to a friends wedding and I had some drinks tea next day I felt TERRIBLE But assumed it was a bad hangover I was so tired and sick and barley functioning When my (now) husband and I left he drove us home and about 20 minutes before home I got this searing pain in my torso I felt like my chest and stomach was going to explode and I was going to be sick and went light headed never felt anything like it It lasted about 30 seconds and then became a dull ache Again I thought it was down to drinking The following day I felt unwell very light headed and like maybe I had the flu We were actually going on holiday 2 days later and I was unaware that he was planning to propose He made excuses to go into town to get a ring box and left me packing our cases I got the sudden urge that I needed a shit and got up to go to the toilet I was so light headed that I had to get off the toilet a lay on the floor Eventually back to the toilet and I passed the darkest stickiest shit of my life I had to crawl back to the bed to lay down because I felt so faint I called my husband to ask him to come home and his day job is in the ambulance service so he immediately recognised my problem I was having a stomach bleed He came home and tried to take my blood pressure but it was so low the machine kept showing an error message Called an ambulance and they came out They couldnt get a line into me because they couldnt find a vein so they loaded me into the ambulance and left When I was I the ambulance they called ahead tothe hospital we have all seen TV dramas and this is not good news My husband tried lying saying it was because of his job but I knew I was very sick I dont remember the rest of the 20 minute ambulance trip (on sirens) so possibly passed out When I got to hospital they took me straight in to resus and did a blood count test Your blood is measured out of 120 and my count was 63 Half my blood was gone In the ambulance I thought I was going to die I felt panic but also a strange sense of calm I genuinely wonder if my body was in such a terrible state that I couldnt process what was happening I would love to say that was the start of recovery but 3 days later I was sneaking medication again - and getting engaged! Took another 6 months for me to admit the problem and get help but I am now 35 years sober and happily married!,dottipants16,16260542350,2

Did my dad need urgent work completed? No Did my mother need urgent health checkups? No All because they wanted to be religious tourists and travel to visit a fucking temple out of state using public transport Now after their own parents siblings and children are still criticising them for their lack of empathy intelligence and discipline have they learnt their lesson?

Yeah Im no exception So late 2019things are going great I have a beautiful girlfriend she has a precious son and we are trying for another inspired by my recent promotions and newfound financial security We were looking at homes shopping for schools just living the dream With one caveat Im an over thinker And I have had problems with jealousy in the past So every time it came up that I was feeling jealous with my new love interacting with and generally doing normal parenting stuff with her boys biological father I very firmly told myself "How absolutely ludicrous It could never happen dont let this irrational thinking go on" So I would bring it up during the times where it was really bothering me and I made sure to be clear in communicating that I didnt have a problem with him and her interacting it was just a twinge of pain from past relationships that I had moved on from She was very reassuring and understanding Around this time we became pregnant and I was elated She was not as enthusiastic given that we hadnt found a place to live yet and I had recently purchased a Camaro thinking wed have plenty of time to prepare We confidently went to our first appointment and discovered we were indeed pregnant Christmas comes around and my father received the gift of learning that hed be a grandfather again in about 8 months from then It was around this time the days after Christmas I had to cope with a little twinge of jealousy I told my girlfriend I was just a hit sad that she only got Christmas evening with me but Christmas morning and new years with him I expressed that I really wanted to spend new years with her and she pretty firmly shot me down almost like she knew I was going to propose and didnt want me to The day before New Years she told me some horrible news She was bleeding a bit and didnt feel "right" in her tummy I asked her if I could take her to the doctor and she said no just to watch her son while she went on her own I figured that was acceptable From 9 am until 7 pm I didnt hear anything from her and it should have just been a short appointment blood work at most She finally called me and said she was on her way over to pick up her son that she was miscarrying and that the doctor told her it was caused by our aggressive intercourse So right off the bat overthinking me is wondering about everything she just said Shes not crying shes simply driving over to pick up her son She arrives and pretty much exactly that happens Inside I was dying on the verge of tears from the moment I saw heruntil the moment she spoke the first words that gave me doubt "I told you we should have been more careful" Thatis not a sentence she had ever spoken to me concerning the health of our unborn baby In fact she was quite persistent and passionate We hugged kissed goodbye and she left me alone with my thoughts to churn The next day without any provocation on New Years she says she needs some space and time to process By this point I have already over thought every scenario and resigned to my room ready to deal with the anxiety and unknowingness that comes from "I need space" I totally accepted her desire for space but I didnt understand it I came to know her as someone who needed a strong and confident partner to confide in because she herself wants to he strong but isnt confident We were such a strong team because she was fiery and passionate on the outside but timid on the inside and I was timid on the outside and fiery on the inside One of the things that continuously churned around in my mind for the first weeks of Jan 2020 was her saying the doctor blamed her aggressive intercourse for her unborn baby dyingand that just stuck out to me as biologically improbable Sure enough after a quick search its exceedingly rare for any complications to arise from intercourse of any intensity Aside from breaching the cervix and tesring it which would be exceedingly painful for both parties theres really not much damage you can do So as every tragedy goes she inevitably decided to leave me with "I thought it was clear we were broken up Im going to stay single for a long time My son is my first priority Youre a great guy" And I let it go Ive got too much experience in this life to flip out and lose emotional control anymore But I let it go in the healthiest way I knew how I gathered the last of her belongings sent her a text "Your stuff is here In 1 month it will be abandoned and you may see me trying to sell it I have time this weekend for you to pick it up if you wish" I didnt receive a response 30 days later in February with thoughts still churning about whether she got an abortion was I that horrible? Faked the miscarriage did she cheat? Never got pregnant is she psycho? I pushed that all to the back of my mind and began posting the items of clothing shoes make up and apple watch she had left behind The watch needed a charger but a trip to Walmart solved that Immediately upon charging the device it connected to my wifi and a string of texts between her and her ex popped upso I read them and essentially learned that they were back together No surprise there Ive been lied to so many times Im surprised when I find out Ive been told the truth What I saw when I scrolled down was a bit more surprising An email from her doctor saying shes soon entering her second trimester with no complications I even got to see the ultrasounds I texted her and said "Do you have a due date? Id like my lawyer to have a timeframe for when we can start the process of establishing paternity" My lawyer advised me not to attempt communication again after that She never responded She skipped state sold her car lives in a big house with her now husband and two sons A much less mature and stable version of me would have compiled this whole shit scenario into a few new criminal charges Be aware overthinkers that your emotions will be your downfall if you let them I have a chance to know who my son is and be a part of his life because of my emotional control Had I went through this a few years prior I likely would have snapped and lost any chance to know my son Stability Learn it Know it Practice every day,hondac55,16205014000,3

gz4scg1,n79n8y,Have you ever wanted to take a dump on your bosses desk? Well my mother did just that Heres the story So I worked for a local newspaper company as a mid-level manager I was basically in charge of being sure that all the actual newspaper carriers were doing their jobs right The company basically expected me to be sure all the carriers had working vehicles otherwise I would have to drive the routes myself I knew at the time that one carrier who had 3 routes totaling 250ish miles a day had just had her truck repoed and would not be able to do her job without help I asked around for a car to borrow with no luck As a last resort I talked my own mother into letting her borrow my now deceased dads truck with the guarantee that my mother would be reimbursed by the company for whatever miles that the truck was driven Originally the carrier borrowing the truck was only supposed to need it for a work day or two Well after two weeks she was still using the truck One day during that time my mother and I had a conversation where I said "I bet money that my boss/the company will back out of guaranteeing the mileage reimbursement money and we will end up with nothing" Her response was something to the effect of "theyll be hearing from me personally if they do" Sure enough 6 WEEKS into the carrier using the truck I get called into the office and am told that the company can no longer guarantee any money for the use of the truck Of course my mother was not happy BUT my boss told me that he would personally be standing there when that carrier got her next paycheck and would have his hand out to get a personal check for the amount due at the time of over $1600 Payday came and turns out he did not do what he said he would and it would now be up to me to get our money Now a little background on my mother She recently had a Colostomy Surgery to repair whatever Since then shes had to wear a colostomy bag and will continue to have to wear one until her next surgery to reattach everything So anyway after the 6 weeks my boss tells me to give the carrier an ultimatum: get her shit together and find a car or well be taking my mothers truck back and she loses her job My mother and I have several more conversations about what she would do if she doesnt get the money thats due I also decided that if the carrier gets fired then I would quit too because I wasnt willing to do three more routes on top of my original job Ultimatum Time comes and goes (8 weeks total of the carrier having the truck later) the mileage bill ends up being OVER $2100 We go and pick up the truck and I had put in my two weeks notice The last day I was working my mother walks in the front door to the office as if she was a customer I immediately knew shit was fixing to hit the fan She walks right into my bosses office closes the door and proceeds to have an hour long chat about the lack of respect that my boss had treated me and by extension my mother with After a while I get called into the office with the two of them and the boss tells us again why the company could not give us the money that was due After which my mother ended the conversation with one last grand statement She stood up said "Well When you treat people like shit" She lifted up the side of her shirt unscrewed the cap to the colostomy bag and dumped the contents directly onto the bosses desk splattering everywhere including on him his keyboard computer monitor all the papers on his desk and running over the edge between his legs My mother then very calmly screwed the cap back on the bag tucked it back under her shirt and walked out the door Both the boss and I were stunned speechless After 10-15 seconds of awed silence the smell hits us and its BAD The boss looks at me and says "Clean this up" to which I reply "Nope what goes around comes around" and I left the building laughing hysterically as all the other employees looked on in horror as the boss walked out of his office with a perfect line of splattered shit across his mid-chest,Crakidos,16217471710,2

Already had plans for if it was through the drive thru then this If by lobby this and if they got behind counter this I had all the steps knew the camera angles to catch them in and had clean surfaces for them to touch for prints They were caught within 12 hours Used the same for the next one as well took a bit longer to catch them Guns in face are not a fun thing at 17-20 years old Mall shootings were just because no one in the company or our mall had ever really thought of it I had seen about several over the years on the news and decided eh may as well look into safety on this and what people wish they did or did do and it saved lives It was my first time working in a mall so again my active brain Ta da Didnt have to use it until year 3 of working at that place Then again twice in year 4 within a month span Saved my customers and some bystanders It went so well because I prepared my team like this too I am crazy calm when things fall apart and I cannot explain that at all Inside I am freaking out But that calm and research and thinking things through saved people on more than one occasion and my store (my store manager and mainly myself because she delegated it to me mostly for my actions and research I had done before to get them to this point) ended up writing the policy for our active shooter and bomb threat scenarios They used about 90% of my stuff in the final policy and video layout that went company wide (international company) Sadly no raise or bonus or whatever from that but we have been told that since it was implemented in 2018 our policy has been used 30 times and saved over 200 people in different events So thats good at least My little mark on the world without a name on it And that is all I wanted in life Other than that it is just missing tire blow outs or things flying off the back of trucks or cars always a first aid kit etc Nothing a little careful observation and just having a small amount of paranoia wont help you out with in general Stay safe friends!,avganxiouspanda,16204500670,1

gxcyblz,n79n8y,Covids effect on stores here in Australia I was a girl scout so "be prepared" is a life motto and Ive had a few really bad times in my life where just getting food has been hard so I now ensure I always have plenty of shelf stable food on hand just in case Im also from SoCal where fire/earthquake/flooding are not unknown so I like to have emergency supplies I moved to Australia about a year before covid and began slowly building up my new food storage and emergency supplies (had to donate all my other stuff) During that time we had a situation where the roads were closed out of Western Australia and there were shortages of some types of foods - fire on one road cyclone flooding the other yes there are only really 2 main roads out its a remote state with a lot of wilderness like hot Alaska Since I dont drive here yet (opposite side of the road hurts my brain) I became familiar with e-commerce and online shopping here in Australia and began to realize that a lot of stuff was dependent on imports and that a lot of websites were not that great so I began stepping up my "prepping" just in case - that experience with the roads showed me that we have somewhat fragile supply lines in Perth - and rebuilt my emergency kit a bit more quickly When I saw the news in China while the fires were going on I bought a bit more than usual during my grocery pickup The staff even teased me a ton about preparing for the end of the world (most people here seem to shop on a as-needed basis so this was me getting like 2 bags of rice and a dozen cans of stuff) Well when covid hit there was a massive run on the stores - every store even the online ones Panic buying was unknown here which made it even more of a frenzy The grocery stores TURNED OFF their online ordering because their systems couldnt handle the demand while other stores had websites that took forever to load and lost orders because they were overloaded so the only way to get food (and many other supplies) was to go in personand even that didnt mean places would be in stock Stuff like canned cat food masks antibacterial wipes bleach batteries exercise equipment just a huge range of everything were just out of stock for weeks or longer Because of our supplies (and the garden I started a few months beforehand) we were able to almost completely avoid stores for nearly 3 months until online ordering came back online and stocks replenished which we were very grateful for as Im immunocompromised I also conviced my husband to upgrade our ute to a nice affordable little used 4x4 since the Ute was getting old and unreliable and we wanted to road trip Once lockdown lifted people in WA were basically stuck here so everyone bought 4x4s and caravans and the prices went up a TON so were grateful for me making that call!,whatisevenrealnow,16204517250,1

Depression So these are all issues we are better off confronting and treating rather than avoiding starting with: i need to get on hormone blockers and adhd meds B needs adhd meds antidepressants and therapy Dad needs adhd meds and therapy These three people are key because we affect quality of life the most for the family but every one of us has things that they need But everyone needs some degree of intervention ultimately Everyone in the family pretty much needs therapy eventually for different reasons Mom and dad seriously need a better way to deal with dads severe adhd and inability to get housechores done or succeed in life generally without guilt tripping or verbally abusing him anymore Dad needs to acknowledge that things being unhygienic and disorganized is hard for him and everyone else I would also have to convince them that B is actually violently abusive and threatens my safety and that the antidepressants helped him a lot in being less violent last time around Also that he should not hang out with cousin M who nearly blinds him with a bb gun in his right eye in a backyard accident and has bad impulse control issues and empathy deficits and is a general bad influence Hard conversations to have all around Oh also some general strategies Uncle ss house is falling apart and is possibly unfixable and they will dwindle their inheritance away on nonsense and fill the house entirely after grandpas death due to depression anxiety and aforementioned hoarding (sorry lots to keep track of my upbringing was chaotic) The best thing is while grandpa B is alive to get him looked at for brain stuff since an aneurysm is what kills him And to figure out a better plan for sams house than what happened last time Preferably to move stuff to storage fix up and sell the place before the foundations and the chimney get worse Get on top of the hoarding issues before the rats take over entirely And then buy s and grandpa b another house Cousin M may be falling in with gangs and getting addicted to meth around then Aunt M may need therapy but probably wont get it They are kinda all toxic af the cousins really The good news is all the kids are super smart and capable I would go back knowing brother S did well in tech support brother B did well in construction but his real talent probably lies in computer engineering auto mechanics or biology - but first adhd depression and i am gonna guess with the violence and the rages he might like me be in that maybe-autistic range too And that i was successful but deeply unhappy in software engineering And that i should focus on doing what i am passionate about while there is time to launch something and not listen to moms pessimistic naysaying about it being impossible to succeed if you do what you love I would also of course have us win a lottery if I could prepare before going back at all I would give them my limited financial advice which is to put a lot of the money into cash deposits but also some into specific investments like google and amazon And later bitcoin Since i already have part of a computer engineering degree and six years of software industry experience i would also have all that knowledge so that would be a serious leg up on the education game I guess i would focus on actually completing my computer engineering degree this time I would focus on the running start program again in high school but be set up with adhd meds and know which people to befriend and who to avoid this time (some of them turned out to be awful but mostly i would be seeking out my old friends One sexually assaults someone if i recall for instance I would have a talk with the victim in private in advance and try to prevent this as best i could) I would tell J about how miserable ish life in japan turns out but also the good stuff (his daughter Miyumi mainly) I would have another recommendation for my family: hire housekeepers now that we are rich Too many people who cant quite look after themselves reliably Same for (aunt) s wherever they end up I would start on hrt as soon as i could By the time i got into uni i would be a lot more comfortable mentally and healthier physically I would focus on completing my computer engineering degree I would be able to afford to get it this time I would not live in campus housing but i would move to dt portland i would help out natali with the homelessness situation again and give her the same advice albeit with some caveats (this guy you meet who houses you and puts you through school has anger issues and will turn a bit abusive You decide you love him anyways in my timeline and he gets into therapy and stuff improves a bit for you both But nerds in general in hindsight are no less prone to toxicity) I would also seek out my uni friend cam since we would not be in the same year anymore I would admit that what i was going to say would sound a bit nuts but that i had to thank her for inspiring me with her courage in being able to come out and be myself the last time around I would also warn her about covid and the coastal fires and upcoming political disasters re trump and give some stock tips as part of that thank you I think with enough lotto winnings i could focus on art and fixing the planet I guess i would get into drones and cybersecurity for uh reasons And maybe be some kind of tech media figure who was kinda solarpunk / transhumanist / socialist themed Probably try to start like freegeek but for vehicles with a focus on lithium ion battery recycling to keel them out of the waste stream And take muay thai again And get into rollerblades and date more Generally the changes would be amazing although i would sometimes get a little sad about people i never met this time but i would also be happy about people i did meet i hadnt run inti last time I couldnt solve every world problem nor would i want to,keirapersephoneblack,16240268290,1

gveoohi,mvicaw,Covid nurse for most of 2020 Had some that came to the ED for shortness of breath cough etc and tested positive They admitted them and then they would sign themselves out AMA (against medical advice) either before coming to the floor or right after arriving because it was a fake virus the hospital just wanted to make more money by testing everyone etc At the very beginning they actually called the hospitals legal department to see if the patient was allowed to sign out AMA since this was a public health crisis Normally patients that are oriented can sign themselves out even if they are actively having a heart attack etc However the concern was letting someone leave who knowingly has a communicable disease who is not going to isolate wear a mask etc and expose the public to it They said it would be illegal to hold him and we had to let them go With all the mistakes that were made (and many of them made multiple times such as re-opening things and relaxing mask use) I have full confidence that with the next pandemic the officials and a percentage of the public will do everything wrong again Edit: I will add that far more patients had what I termed "Covid regret" That is they admitted they didnt believe the news the doctors etc and were careless and now regretted it One caught it at a party their family had Their elderly sister exposed them all and recovered; my patient died three days later It was a sad realization for many who lived or died and a most unfortunate way to learn,toejamandtoast,16190637930,14

gw9aymb,n0jxcp,The Story of Taylor Swift by u/spilledcomputerguts Born on December 13th 1989 in Reading Pennsylvania Swift grew up on a christmas tree farm until she was 12 At 12 the Swift family packed up and moved to Nashville so Taylor could pursue her dreams in music Her first "in" with a label was with RCA except it was a "development deal"  which is "we like you kind of" and they wouldnt let her record her own songs So she did what you dont normally do when you have an in at a label she walked out Later on she was performing a showcase at the Bluebird Cafe in Nashville Ironically the same place where Faith Hill got discovered And a man named Scott Borchetta walked up to her and said "youre good I want you on my label heres my info call me" So she called him He said "Good news and bad news Taylor Good - I want you on my label Bad - I dont have a label Yet Will you wait for me?" She waited In 2006 Big Machine Records was formed with Swift being the first artist signed Her debut album fuelled by singles like "Tim McGraw" "Our Song" and "Picture To Burn" proved successful and her follow up 2008s Fearless made her the youngest woman to win Album of the Year at the Grammys And in 2009 she won the MTV VMA for video of the year for "You Belong With Me" when Kanye West infamously interrupted her prompting swift condemnation (pun intended) and even President Obama called West a "jackass" Taylor was accused of "not pulling her weight" in writing sessions so her third album "Speak Now" was ENTIRELY self written zero co-writers Fun fact: Taylor is credited as writer on EVERY song she has ever released and her co-writers have stated she comes in with finished lyrics and theyre more like editors to trim so the song isnt 10 minutes long "Speak Now" wasnt the original album name Swift had chosen "Enchanted" as the title track and Borchetta made her change it because it sounded "too much like high school and fairytales" Borchetta is also a r@t and well cover that when we get to the 2019 sale of Big Machine Now moving on to RED This was a departure from her previous work with the lead single "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" which SMASHED records and catapulted Swift from "country singer" to certified pop star Swift embarked on the massively successful Red Tour which is her only tour to not have an accompanying live concert album/movie as the director was accused of sexual misconduct and Swift didnt want her name associated with him The Red era also brought significant criticisms regarding Swifts personal life even though she dated "the normal amount for a 22 year old" This was caused by her publicist at the time spreading rumours to sleazy tabloids In 2013 while Swift was on the Red Tour she was groped in a meet and greet by a Colorado radio DJ More on that when we get to the trial in 2017 And when she lost the Album of the Year grammy in 2013 she went back to the drawing board and created "1989"  which catapulted her even FURTHER into stardom when it released in October 2014 At the 2015 Grammys she became the first woman to win AOTY twice Around the Grammys in 2015 Kanye West released a song "Famous" which includes the lines "I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex/Why? I made that b**** famous"  referring to the VMAs incident from 2009 West claimed he had Swifts blessing Swift and her new publicist Tree Paine denied this Wests wife Kim Kardashian leaked an illegally recorded video of a phone call between West and Swift where Swift appears to be mildly comfortable with the sex line but the use of the term "that b****" was never mentioned Swift released a widely-mocked Notes app statement saying "I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative one which I have never asked to be a part of since 2009" Full video of the call leaked years later further proves that Swift told the truth In July 2016 Kardashian tweeted "Wait its legit national snake day? They have holidays for everyone  i mean everything  these days!" (a thinly veiled jab at Swift) followed by a bunch of snake emojis Wests fans then attacked Swift on social media flooding her comments with snake emojis The hashtag #TaylorSwiftIsOverParty was trending #1 worldwide for days In Swifts words "do you know how many people have to hate you in order for that to trend for that long?" Swift disappeared for over a year Retreating from the public eye lead to the creation of 2017s "reputation" which kicked off with the lead single "Look What You Made Me Do" and the record breaking "reputation Stadium Tour" followed in 2018 Before continuing lets circle back to the sexual assault trial Swift was groped by Denver radio DJ David Mueller in 2013 and there is photographic evidence of him reaching up her skirt and latching onto her bottom Swift reported this to his boss he was fired He then sued Swift for millions of dollars Swift filed a countersuit for a symbolic $1 claiming sexual assault and battery The jury sided with Swift In 2018 Swift also broke her longstanding political silence and endorsed two Democratic candidates in the midterm elections while encouraging fans to vote She has continued her activism and political outspokenness to this day Swift left Big Machine Records following the reputation Stadium Tour signing a 7 album deal with Republic Records Prior to the release of Lover news broke that music manager Scooter Braun had purchased Big Machine The value of BMR was increased as they own Taylors first six albums  Swift does not own her own work from 2006 to 2017 which is shocking Artists should always own their work Braun managed Kanye West and Justin Bieber and used Biebers social media to attack Swift In Swifts words: "I learned about Scooter Brauns purchase of my masters as it was announced to the world All I could think about was the incessant manipulative bullying Ive received at his hands for years Like when Kim Kardashian orchestrated an illegally recorded snippet of a phone call to be leaked and then Scooter got his two clients together to bully me online about it [] Now Scooter has stripped me of my lifes work that I wasnt given an opportunity to buy Essentially my musical legacy is about to lie in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it This is my worst case scenario [] Any time Scott Borchetta has heard the words Scooter Braun escape my lips it was when I was either crying or trying not to He knew what he was doing; they both did Controlling a woman who didnt want to be associated with them In perpetuity That means forever" Lover was released shortly after and is the first album that Swift owns entirely In November 2019 Big Machine attempted to block Swift from performing a mashup of her biggest hits at an award show and using past concert footage in a documentary as they claimed it would be violating the re-recording clause of her agreement She is legally allowed to begin re-recording her previous work (so that she owns at least a version of her past work) starting in November 2020 and has stated she intends to do so Borchetta and Braun told her that either she shuts up about what theyre doing to her or they wont let her play her music So she made a public plea for us (her fans) to help her knowing we would go to war for her And go to war we did She did the medley The footage was used in the documentary And she still intends to re-record her lifes work that they stole Fast forward to 2020 The global pandemic caused the cancellation of all her live performances this year Isolation proved to be a creative boon for Swift as she wrote her next album within months Last Thursday she marked a new first The first time she ever did a surprise drop Swift announced the album "folklore" on Thursday July 23 and told the world it would be out at midnight "folklore" has broken countless records in its first week shattering her own sales records "folklore" sold 13 MILLION units worldwide in its first 24 hours (pure sales like they dont even happen anymore in the streaming era but they do for Swift) The album and its lead single "cardigan" have broken numerous streaming records In December 2020 Swift followed "folklore" up with a surprise drop of its sister album "evermore" which went on to break even more records In February 2021 Swift announced the first of her six re-recorded albums would be out April 9th "Fearless (Taylors Version)" includes all 19 original Fearless tracks plus "Today Was A Fairytale" and six never-before-heard tracks from the Fearless vault The vault tracks topped the iTunes chart By topping her previous works with each new release and even with re-recordings of 13-year-old songs Swift has proven time and again that she is a master of reinventing herself while staying true to herself and her loyal fanbase As Barbara Walters said in a 2014 interview "Taylor Swift is the music industry",SpilledComputerGuts,16196684720,2

Anyway so he was kidnapped by Dr Kirk Langstrom which should be a familiar name if you know anything about Batman and he tests a very early prototype of the Man-Bat formula on Jimmy at a time where the formula is still in development Jimmy uses his signal watch he was given by Superman to call for help and sure enough the Man of Steel charges in and saves the day > Now theres one thing you have to know about Jimmy Olsen; he often gets transformed into different things So for DC logic hes likely got a metagene that means hes capable of adapting to genetic modification better So yeah Langstrom fucking dies because he thinks the formula used on Jimmy was stable when it wasnt Jimmy returns to Metropolis keeping Bruce Waynes secret from everyone Over the next week he starts getting stronger and faster and he develops super sonic hearing his reflexes get better he basically becomes Daredevil if Daredevil could see and was a photographer who was an aspiring journalist He gets a call from Bruce Wayne asking to see him as Langstrom was an employee of Waynetech before he went rogue and when he visits Wayne Manor the Bat-Signal flares up Jimmy stares at it for a moment noticing Bruces discontentment with being unable to do anything and he excuses himself for the bathroom but actually runs down to the Batcave to put on a Batsuit and steal the Batmobile > After an awkward conversation with Gordon on top of the GCPD building he rushes over to the hostage situation at the Gotham Gazette He finds out Victor Zsasz is up to his old serial killer tricks again having locked everyone inside and he has to be discrete about how he takes down Zsasz which is not something Jimmys been trained for Bruce however having noticed Jimmys obvious absence directs him in taking down the maniac and while many died and many more were traumatised Jimmy Olsen Batman saved the day But he gets scolded by Wayne and told never to do something as reckless as that again although Alfred thanks him on both of their behalves shortly afterward After he returns once again to Metropolis he keeps reading news from over in Gotham and finds that too much is happening there for him to be able to stay away He applies for a job at the Gazette and sees Superman off at the airport having been informed at some point by Bruce that hes actually Clark Kent He gets the job as a reporter gets approval from Bruce to be a new Batman and the rest is history > So yeah it turns out Jimmy Olsen Batman ends up being a way better Batman than Bruce could ever have been Hes not a billionaire he spent a long time as collateral damage of a superheros fights so he values civilians a lot more and the separation of Bruce Wayne and Batman allow Bruce to be a much better parent to Dick Grayson who still becomes Robin but never loses his respect in either his adoptive father or the Batman Jason Todd gets sent to live in an orphanage in Fawcett City where he becomes a member of the family Shazam Joker never quite gets cured but over time the difference Jimmy makes actually does change him some and he gains moments of clarity enough even to share wisdom with a young Tim Drake about his time as the Red Hood prompting Tim to become the new Red Hood and then it turns out that actually Talia Al Ghul slid into Jimmy Olsens tinder DMs in a real Superman comic so if hes Batman of course theyre going to bone She might not have meant to have a kid with him but I mean the kid would have superpowers And Damian does he gets enormous Bat-wings even and becomes a young Nightwing named after a story Superman once told Jimmy about the heroes of Krypton Lots of stuff changes but mainly Gotham changes as Jimmy Olsens impact as Batman is just far far better than any other versions has been Because he treats his villains with compassion and of course as the Editor for the Gazette he ensures the town is keeping a lot more honest than it used to > Wait why are you kicking me out you havent heard my pitch for a Victor Zsasz fights the Question movie spinoff!,Gate4043,16196381130,1

gygvux1,nehqa9,In San Diego a city known for tons of sunshine throughout the year my school had the bright idea to ban hats on campus To be clear this rule applied outdoors as much as indoors I wrote an editorial for the school newspaper about how silly it was I interviewed the principal and the reason he gave for the rule was "So we can quickly identify intruders" I also interviewed a local dermatologist who was more than happy to talk about how the rule was medically irresponsible The outcome of the editorial was that the school became pretty willing to grant waivers to let students wear hats but they never actually rescinded the rule I dont think Ill ever understand the administrations fixation I wish Id asked pointed questions like "Dermatologists say that sunscreen requires frequent reapplication that would take more time than students have between classes With that in mind what do you say to the families of concerned students who have had to deal with skin cancer?" and "Is the school concerned about being held liable for medical bills as a result of enforcing rules that make preventive measures impossible?"

To be honest the school is good the teachers and canteen and everything is well done just that our principal had a very extreme perspective into stuff and really stubborn to it I hope he would change and hes old Young saplings are able to shape but old trees can only break The school is open by our principal and so only him have power over everything The school is quite famous in the town so a lot of people including my parents did not know the school background clearly before entering it EDIT: first rule I talked about includes weekend hanging out with friends if we were caught by the VPs or admin we are definitely ready to be punished by canes and demerits,kemkemkrm,16213615690,2

And that was it lol not worth selling a couple more cases I also couldnt help but imagine what the outcry would be if I sent a female sales rep I just met my genitals Two weeks later I saw her pop up all over the beer industry news groups for getting black out drunk at a beer fest to the point she pressed her crotch against a chain link fence & pissed all over it Then went over to where the bands were playing started physically attacking people in the crowd and then started fighting security when they came for here She got fired right after because the craft booze industry is pretty tight Nit and word travels fast so it turns out I didnt have to talk business with her anyway,darthphallic,16223842750,2
h00gmiz,nns8ge,Around two weeks ago at around 11 PM I got super hungry and decided to get some fast food Due to COVID and stimulus payments most fast food places in my town no longer stay open so late because they no longer have the personnel to man them SoI ended up in a lonely diner There were only two workers manning this diner but that wasnt a problem because there was only one other customer there and he was busy chatting up the only waitress while he sat at the counter with a cup of coffee between his hands After the waitress took my order he tried to continue talking to her but she told him shed have to begin filling my order He then turned to me and stated that Arizona had just completed their recount of the 2020 presidential votes and that they found that there indeed were problems with the votes - so many that Trump actually HAD won Arizona which meant that he had actually won the presidential bid He went on to say that after seeing the results of the Arizona recount Wisconsin was going to do a recount of their own Regardless he said Trump actually won the election and by June July at the latest he wound again be president and would be back in the Whitehouse This was terribly disturbing to me (I am by NO MEANS a Trump fan) mainly because I was wondering how I had missed such alarming news He then went on to say "And when Trumps back in office the first thing he gonna do is go after all the Satanists!" WaituhWHAT?!?! He saw the puzzled look on my face so he continued "oh yeah  most people dont know it but the Satanists have a base hidden on the moon And they use it to control satellites around the Earth that shoot lasers and blah blah blah" (At this point my ears had shut down and I let him ramble on and on about Satanists pedos and how Trump was gonna save us from them all) The thing is this guy looked and seemed so perfectly normal up till then As I was leaving the diner I passed another guy coming into the diner that was surely letting his *freak flag* fly (multi-colored Mohawk hairdo nail polish (different color for each finger) and a generally creepy vibe about him) The whole experience reminded me of a rap song from the 80s: "The Freaks Come Out at Night",jgb75,16224079980,2

gxyz4qa,nbaar5,I was studying photography and used to act as an assistant to a well known wedding photographer Went to a couples wedding He shot digital and I shot black and white film Spent all day with the couple from 9am through till 2am the next morning when we left I could see how genuinely in love they were It was only a day but I got to know them quite well and really liked them both The next morning I get a call from the photographer and his voice was shaky He explained that the groom had been murdered that night after the reception party Three guys had broken into their bungalow to steal wedding gifts The groom got out of bed to stop them and they executed him in front of the bride I was in shock for about two weeks This story was in South Africa if that helps explain how or why this happened The next weekend the photographer and I went to the brides house to present her with the photos Wed worked together to get the job massively accelerated so she had the photos of her husband We did it at our own expense and didnt charge her a penny for the day or all the prints and album Sort of the least we could do Because my photos didnt matter as much Id been able to simply capture those natural moments between them rather than staged wedding photos So they had the normal album pics but also about 150 snaps of just them being a couple She was in tears from the moment we arrived till we left a few hours later She was a shadow of the women Id met only a week earlier That shit still haunts me Edit: I didnt expect this story to get the attention it has Im sorry for any upset this has caused anyone reading this but I believe its an important reality check I loved south Africa in a lot of ways but its a very troubled place with insane murder and rape rates My story is by no means unique or even particularly shocking by south African standards I also have worse stories like this from friends and neighbours I have CPTSD from my time living there and the things Id endured Ive got friends who were diagnosed with PTSD stemming from their time there too Also for anyone wanting to read the news article about this event : https://wwwiolcoza/news/south-africa/bride-mourns-as-robbers-kill-man-at-resort-351744 I hope this dissuades a few people from visiting South Africa and in doing so perhaps I save a few lives,HumbleTrees,16209096320,28588

gy02mbm,nbaar5,We went to a strip club the weekend before for a bachelor party (yeah I know But this was more than a decade ago when I was 21) There was a stripper that stood out She was older (by stripper standards) and would do push-ups on stage The grooms brother ended up getting her number Anyways I was a groomsman and standing up at the alter and another groomsman nudges me and gives the nod point to someone sitting in about the 3rd row Who is it? No other than older muscular stripper! At first we thought grooms brother invited her but no! It was just a coincidence and she happened to be the date of a guest of the bride Well this news spread like wildfire and the two of them left shortly after the reception started (I dont think her date knew she was a stripper) The wedding itself wasnt ruined actually made it a bit more entertaining But stripper and her dates night was definitely ruined,I_Fart_It_Stinks,16209273030,3

gx2y95p,n5mj47,When I was 28 I found out that my dad was not my biological father The news came out via the following: my dad was battling depression and was suicidal so I had just flown home to try to take care of him and rescue him from my moms wrath My mom had verbally and emotionally abused him during their entire relationship He loved her so much and he tolerated it Well during a solemn walk w/ my dad as I tried to help him out he confided that hes not my biological dad and he went on to tell me he knew this all along but my mom lied to him and tried to convince him that he was my biological father He knew he wasnt but he wanted to play the role When I was 10 years old my mom finally confessed this to him and he was worried that upon hearing the news officially hed somehow let this affect his relationship with me So when I was 28 years old during this walk w/ my dad as he pours out this story to me he frames it by telling me that his two most proud items in his life are: (1) how I turned out / his raising me; (2) that he had completely forgot about the news my mom told him earlier in that day (when I was 10) about him not being my biological father and that it was only upon tucking me in at night (when I was 10) that it briefly crossed his mind It was at that point that he knew nothing would ever come between us and our father-son relationship would be as awesome as ever He also confided that my mom did hard drugs while pregnant with me and this broke his heart to witness firsthand They were very poor My dad grew up in a foster home without parents My mom grew up w/ 6 siblings and ill-equipped parents She dropped out of 9th grade whereas all of her other siblings dropped out earlier -- many of them are barely literate Im now mid-30s and tragically my dad committed suicide mid-March 2020 right as COVID was hitting I was out of the country at the time but immediately flew 30 hours (30-min layover) and made it in time for his funeral I do everything in his honor **[UPDATE:]** Wow this thread blew up overnight! My most popular comment by 2 orders of magnitude and its about my sorrow Im just glad so many of you read about how amazing my dad was and I truly appreciate the outpour of kind thoughtful words and wishes It warms my heart I could go on and on with countless examples about how amazing he was After graduating from the orphanage at age 18 he moved up to Atlanta by himself and taught himself woodworking He was incredible and would build fine-furniture pieces for renowned interior decorators and his items would be in magazines all the time He was a starving artist -- we always struggled to get by Yet I felt like a spoiled kid on my street as I had life easier than everyone else (the other kids on my street lived in trailer-homes and had very chaotic households) and it was clear that both of my parents loved me immensely and I felt very well-provided for and supported I was very lucky to have him in my life I still think about him daily and Im trying to improve emotionally I appreciate everyone sharing your own similar stories and it provides a sense of camaraderie Hearing the shared pain and empathy and seeing that this resonated with so many people it motivates me to finally write a Short Stories book that would include snippets from my relationship with him For those interested in reading more about him: **[EXERPT FROM MY EULOGY TO HIM WHICH I WROTE WHEN FLYING TO HIS FUNERAL]** **2 His hard work** For my entire upbringing he worked every single day in his shop for long hours  didnt even take a day off for Christmas or his birthday As a kid I witnessed his work ethic and it forever left an impression on me Importantly he didnt appear as if he was working for someone else; he was working for himself He found what he loved  woodworking  and he completely immersed himself into and dedicated his life to making perfectly crafted items because he wanted to He had passion a pursuit of perfection and an unlimited tank of dedication to fuel it He didnt just make items He didnt just work He made masterpieces When I was 18 and left home to go to college I aspired to be like my dad He set the example I was trying to make something of myself and to really give it my all just like he did His work ethic was ingrained in me I would get 4-5 hours of sleep many nights every week For years It was hard but I always thought about how much harder my dad worked I would recall memories of him working in his shop late at night: Id hear the saws spinning; The compressor running; memories of huge sawdust piles under his table-saw He did so much to provide for our family He always provided I remember being a kid hanging out with him in his shop admiring his dedication to the craft and strive for perfection So when I was 18 starting college I was trying to make him proud and I was also trying to do everything I could so that Id have the opportunity to do anything I want in this world Not just for myself but on behalf of my dad A part of me felt that whatever opportunity I gained whatever success I had it was in hopes that he too would somehow benefit That he could vicariously get what he deserved He deserved the world and Ive just been trying to channel his hard work and do my part Anything Ive accomplished its because of my dad **3 His creative problem solving abilities** Not only did my dad work relentlessly hard but he masterfully found creative solutions to everything He truly dedicated his life to solving problems and designing furniture for others There is no physical item he could not figure out His ability to do so was way beyond anything Ive ever witnessed None of my colleagues at MIT Harvard Brown or whatever fancy place Ive worked at could remotely come close to having my dads unique ability to creatively make things work Whatever the problem my dad could find a solution When he was 12 he was excited once he learned that you could repair some radios just by replacing the diodes When I was a kid he made me an incredible tree house with its own electricity line When I was a teenager there was a large ice storm in Georgia that caused half a million homes to lose power for up to a week our house included My dad had an old portable black and white TV He grabbed his car battery and rigged it up so that we could watch TV for days despite not having power His vehicles over the years had so many contraptions and workarounds they were often like modern day Flintstones cars This was how he did things his entire life **5 His strength and character** His perseverance was unmatched He handled so much adversity over the years especially the past 10 years when he was in so much pain He was the strongest person Ive ever met Hands down In recent years he experienced and recovered from Stevens-Johnsons syndrome a rare horrific deadly skin disorder that covers the entire body He was resilient beyond belief and he endured so many personal obstacles that were thrown his way His strength wasnt just in his ability to endure but in his bravery I have many stories from my childhood where he stepped us to save the day in crises He was fearless Not only was he courageous in his character but he was also physically strong as an ox It was uncanny In his 60s he could often lift more than I could in my 30s despite my being really into weightlifting but Ill spare you the fun humbling details **6 Vulnerability and gentleness** Once I became an adult he was strong enough to admit to me tough moments in his life He was willing to confide in me painful times that he endured He was willing to call on me for help and to tell me when he felt he wasnt strong enough We all feel this way at times He was vulnerable to cry He showed me that ones willingness to show vulnerability is in fact a product of strength and bravery **11 Closing** As I close I want to mention one of my favorite artists Alanis Morissette who has a stanza that challenges us by asking: "How bout remembering your divinity? How bout unabashedly bawling your eyes out? How bout not equating death with stopping?" To this effect I know that my dad will continue to inspire me and influence me for the rest of my life without question I am who I am because of him Ive always aspired to uphold the principles and he stood for And I hope that others see in me his virtues and pieces of his personality I want to continue his legacy Thus he hasnt stopped Further I challenge all of you to do the same in never equate death with stopping That is we can do better than just remembering someone; we can do better than just remembering my dad We can continue to learn from what hes taught us the elements Ive mentioned today: 1 When you find something you love whether its work or a hobby put everything you have into it 2 Be willing to think creatively to solve problems 3 Take the time to enjoy the so-called minutia in life the alleged trivial details make it significant 4 Be willing to play and be silly; dont take yourself too seriously 5 Be brave Be strong Be so strong that youre willing to be vulnerable 6 Be a teacher and be a lifelong student 7 Mean everything you say and speak earnestly 8 Connect with others; form a community And be there for others We could all benefit from the help of others so be unafraid to rely on others for support I would do anything to have my dad with us here today In his own words which he often told me: "its not what happens to you but how you handle it" So again I urge you all to *handle* this tragedy by staying strong connecting with community and the support of others and continuing to learn from my dad Thank you all for being here It means the world to me and I know it means the world to my dad,stillworkin,16202531660,8127

h61r3ox,oop94z,I havent done it but this brings to mind a tiktocker I follow She was posting her pregnancy journey to tik tok to spread awareness her son had a lot of rare medical issues that there isnt much knowledge of She was told he wouldnt live but she continued with the pregnancy and remained hopeful She had even gotten slightly better news at her last OB appointment but sadly she went into preterm labor and he died She then posted updates about what they were doing with his body what all the hospital did for her planning his funeral etc She tried to remain strong but like most parents would do in that situation broke down I believe in her case she wanted to spread awareness But she was living a nightmare and thats part of spreading awareness is to be honest and vulnerable,angel-girl2020,16269004700,1
h62ecey,oop94z,I have a niece who made a "secret" profile in one of the social media platforms and actually went viral It started when she broke up with her boyfriend but as it took off she was getting so much feedback from other teenage girls about how she was helping them with their own issues that she continued to do it for months She was actively searching out things to cry over My sister came across it in the random news/top post feed and was absolutely floored to see her daughter was crying on the internet  and even more surprised that she had over 100k likes/subscribers or whatever I cant pretend to understand it and I never even checked it out on my own I love my niece and I didnt want my opinion of her to possibly change As for why I think most people do it? I think a lot of the time its because people are wanting to communicate to one specific person without actually communicating with them Why they think its better to communicate with EVERYONE is a little strange but youre typically not thinking clearly when youre that emotionally over something,kvothe000,16269113200,1
h0uu6tb,ntofxm,I served a short stint as a fireman There was a RTA call one morning 30 mins after I started my shift This guy got T boned while driving home after a night of heavy drinking He got T boned on the passengers side when he ran a red light his wife died instantly and he pretty much remained unharmed When we arrived at the scene he was outside his car while the wife was still seated in the passenger seat Her lower body was still in her seat while her upper torso splayed over to the drivers side looks like she was just reaching over to the drivers side to open the door just that shes unconscious and nonreactive No blood at all from what we can see from the drivers side the passengers door was caved in badly The driver was still tipsy and thought nothing of whats happening kept asking us to hurry up and extract his wife so that they can head back home Laughing and fumbling around with the police When the paramedics realised that there was no pulse we tried extracting her from the drivers side and we realised that her lower left body her left pelvis to her thigh was completely crushed and she was impaled through her left abdomen by a piece of the door When we told him that his wife has died probably bled out minutes after the impact you could see the disbelief (stop kidding me) slowly morphing into realisation then ending up as desperation He was immediately sober and ran over to the drivers side tried to pull his wife out It tore her wound up and we had to drag him out He then proceeded to the passenger side and tried to pry the caved door open We left the scene then and let the police handled the aftermath Saw it on the news that afternoon,pricklyheatt,16230265760,964

h0vru2g,ntofxm,LONG STORY I have never shared this story that I can remember It sometimes gives me nightmares Maybe if I share it I can let some of it go Its a very long story I worked as a temp when I was first out of college about 30 years ago As anyone who temps knows its a very diverse pool of people you come across as coworkers One co-worker of mine was a woman from another state I wont mention names or states so any details are changed for reasons that will be obvious She was an older lady and she was missing an eye She did not have an artificial eye Just no eye Ill call her Grace Grace confided in me one day that she had lost her eye during a carjacking in a major metropolitan city She had been shot three times and raped she said Her husband was in "the military" and was overseas in combat He would be coming home from his tour and retiring after this tour She regularly sent him care packages of personal supplies and food She had an adult daughter but her daughter was estranged and she didnt get to speak to her often Grace was always lecturing me to "call your mom it means a lot" She bought a new SUV when her husbands military pay came he had told her to get one as soon as it came in It was pretty nice nicer than any vehicle I ever could afford I visited her house a couple of times She had a large parrot that talked She said it missed her husband terribly and sometimes when she let it out of its cage she would tease him and say "Wheres papa?" and the bird would go looking around for him Although she was a little odd I figured I would be too if the things that had happened to her had happened to me But some of the things she said sometimes threw me off a little and I started getting some "spidey sense" feelings once in a while One day I was reading the news online and there was an article about an inmate at the state corrections prison who was suing the state for "maltreatment" I think I read it three or four times because something seemed familiar to me about the name At first I thought maybe I had heard about the story before But when I got to work the next day it struck me that the name was Graces husbands name It was a fairly unusual name I kept it to myself though because who knows there could be more than one person by that name But it kept bugging me One day near the holidays she said he was coming home for leave and she was excited to see him She would have to drive far upstate to the base he was stationed from I was so glad for her and it seemed like the person in the paper was someone else entirely After the holidays he went back to the middle east Things went back to normal But Grace started getting really stress-y saying he might have to stay after this tour as well They needed the money because temping wasnt making enough And the military offers a lot to stay in She was hoping he would not have to She began giving me gifts both of food and trinkets I usually have a suspicion of gifts and I associate them with someone trying to make up for something I know its a pessimistic outlook but its rooted in my childhood Anyway it made my senses tingle again I started turning down the gifts at one point I also did not feel comfortable visiting her anymore She just began to unsettle me As spring came I was reading the news and I saw the follow-up for the story about the prisoner and I got curious so I looked up the entire lawsuit He had gotten a six figure settlement but was still not getting out The internet was not what it is today and searching for people online was pretty rudimentary But court cases were available and came up pretty quickly in a search engine As I read the entire transcript I was horrified to find out that the man who was suing for maltreatment was a rapist and a child molester He had been in prison for over twenty years and his parole was denied because he was listed as "dangerous and violent" As I browsed the legal site I came across some of his earlier court proceedings Apparently he had years added to his sentence because when one of his victims was about five his girlfriend had brought her in for visitation and had helped him get away with molesting her in the jail visitation room He had gotten caught she somehow escaped criminal charges but they took the child away I still had no proof that this was Graces husband but I was so freaked out by the story and had nightmares for several nights in a row about what I had read And working with Grace became excruciatingly hard Things that never alarmed me before began actually frightening me One day she left for lunch and wanted to go somewhere in her vehicle but I said I brought my lunch and wanted to stay at work She seemed overly cranky about it After lunch I was working for about an hour when I realized she hadnt returned from lunch Supervisors began asking me if I knew where she went I said I didnt but I hoped she hadnt gotten in an accident or something At break time I went for a walk which I usually went on with Grace She still was not back As I went around the corner she pulled up in the SUV I told her I was worried something had happened and that the supervisors were asking about her She was angry and said I should have covered for her better I was kind of offended She then told me to get in the vehicle that she would give me a ride back to work I told her I would just walk back it was just around the block for heavens sake She suddenly yelled at me "WHY WONT YOU GET IN THE CAR? JUST GET IN!" I was like no thanks I will meet you back there When she finally got into the office she sat down and in a low voice said "Why wont you ride in my car? Why are you refusing to come to my house? I know something is wrong what is the problem?" I said there was no problem what could be the problem? Theres no problem She said "Oh there is a problem" under her breath The supervisor came over and asked to talk to her and she was let go She told me I should have covered for her Not really in my nature unless there is something life or death though Then she left angry The supervisor saw her yell at me and then they talked to me They said not to feel bad they had let her go for other reasons She had falsified information on her entrance paperwork and it was some serious stuff I was like was it about her background? And they said yeah did you know about her husband? And I said I thought he was overseas They just shook their heads I didnt ask and they didnt tell me any more For years after even after I married and changed my name and moved all over creation I still was fearful of her And the husband Because it turns out it was him And he was the one who had shot her And even though he did that and harmed children she was still faithful to him I kept an eye on his sexual offender status for years One day he was paroled So he was actually out there somewhere Terrifying But one year when I searched his status it said he was no longer registered as an offender because he was deceased I had never looked Grace up but when I did I saw she was deceased as well No clue how either one died just saw the death notices I hope their child or children are ok somewhere I cant imagine being a close family member to those two I sometimes wonder what might have happened the day she wanted me to get in her vehicle Even back then I had read enough true crime to know some possible outcomes TLDR: I once had a coworker whose husband shot her in the face taking her eye and molested her child and other children and she stuck by him and built an entire story about him being a soldier overseas when he was really in prison for violent rape and molestation Which she had some collaboration in They are both long deceased,Reality_Defiant,16230471390,92

h0tx5r4,ntofxm,This will probably be buried this is also a personal story of mine as well & is 100% true It was my Junior year of high school in SA TX I went to an unremarkable but decent high school I lived in at the time what was known as "Medical Center" in the city as it was a large concentration of hospitals various specialty clinics health schools etc Anyways in the beginning to middle of Junior year there was large scare going around at the time of a string of sexual assaults & robberies taking place in the area & every victim described it being done by one suspect over time he became known as "The Medical Center rapist" Nobody was able to track him down for a while & this scare went on for about the whole of Junior year into the summer heading towards Senior year & then it just stopped at about the beginning of my Senior year The reason I bring up my Junior year is because I had a class 2nd period Spanish 1 class to be exact Nothing too crazy in that class a typical mish mash of students & a really nice teacher & everyone fairly recognizes each other More on this later So after I graduated & moved away (It was one year after I had moved) I get a text from my mother with a link to a local news article with her saying "Do you know this kid???" I clicked the link the article & sure enough they had caught "The Medical Center rapist" As it turns out he was an 18 year old (at the time of committing the rapes he was 16-17 yrs old) kid I had 2nd period Spanish with in my Junior year I wont give his full name but I will call him "AH" if you go to google & type in "San Antonio Medical Center rapist" you will see it I shared a full year of class with a serial rapist he was committing rapes in the same time I had class with him & nobody was none the wiser He seemed like a normal kid he had a gf was part of the basketball team had friends & didnt really raise any red flags To think it could have been my friends sisters or my mother attacked & it would have been a kid in my class without knowing & the realization of seeing him everyday with him possibly committing a sexual assault just the night before I messaged various friends & even some ex Spanish 2 classmates I had & they were as shocked as I was we couldnt believe it Want to hear the real kicker? He was arrested TWO DAYS after he graduated (he was a year below me & like I said it was almost exactly one year after I graduated that they caught him) His trial lasted about 2 years & in the mean time all of his friends ran online protests like "Release AH we know hes innocent" & "Justice for wrongly convicted AH" little did they know they had substantial evidence against AH they had DNA evidence from the rapes fingerprints the various victims & witnesses confirmed that it was indeed their attacker & after two years of trials & testimonies he received 99 years of prison (I dont know the full details of his sentence but it doesnt look like hes ever getting out as he shouldnt if you really want to know the full details feel free to look up the articles yourselves easy search) An 18 year old ex rapist classmate ruined his life just as he was about to live it he even had a committed gf at the time of all of this (I even had her for a class in Senior year) & had plenty of friends & loving family he had a good life I cant imagine how his gf & family felt Im glad hes in prison & will likely never get out It still shocks me to this day that there really are monsters all around us that we cant exactly see & are really good at hiding their evil & blending in,thepositivepandemic,16230102120,175

h0ve1ju,ntofxm,Ive mentioned this before in another AskReddit question awhile back Heres the [link](https://wwwredditcom/r/AskReddit/comments/lypi3v/serious_whats_something_creepy_that_has_happened/gpvda4s?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) for that post And heres what I wrote The scariest part of my story is I was so close to where it happened Our neighbor is notoriously known for having frequent fights so frequent that almost every night youd hear them screaming their lungs out at each other One night I was outside minding my own business and I heard them starting another fight I rolled my eyes in the first few minutes as it was about the husband being drunk again Few more minutes pass they then started throwing stuff around their house A few more minutes pass I heard the wife ask a question angrily "You did what?" She yelled Now I just assumed that the husband did something really bad that mustve pissed off the wife Everything beyond that were more inaudible voices so I didnt exactly see the entire picture of their fight not until the wife started screaming in fear She started yelling "Get away from me!" and "Let me go!" I started to become concerned as the screams continued and thought I should call the cops But apparently someone did it first so a police car pulled over in front of their house I assumed it was a noise complaint from another neighbor When the police came to inspect the fighting and yelling completely stopped I thought it was over A few days later after I came back from school I saw 3 police cars in front of their house I saw the man in cuffs and was arrested At first I assumed that the wife had reported his husband for domestic violence As I got into our house my parents were looking through the window and I asked them what was going on My mom said that she heard from a fellow neighbor of ours that the man had murdered his wife and chopped her up I was completely shocked and also creeped out by the news More so when our local news on the TV had a report about it the man had apparently hid the body parts in their washer room and covered it powdered soap It was shocking knowing that I lived next to a psychopath Although it does make it a good story to tell in a group of friends but it still creeps the shit out of me I sometimes would imagine if the guy went on a rampage it was literally the closest I got to a real life horror movie,AverageReditor13,16230375230,18
h0ui54k,ntofxm,Two local cases come to my mind and Id love if people started talking about this The Case of Selena Not-Afraid an unfortunate member of MMIW Her case was REALLY strange though; she was missing for about 20 days and then her body was discovered in a place that many searchers swore they searched None of the people she had been partying with the night she dissapeared were taken in police basically ignored the family and their cries for justice and further investigation and little has been done since https://heavycom/news/2020/01/selena-selina-not-afraid-notafraid-missing/ Another horrifying case was the murder of Antonio Renova 5 at the hands of his biological parents (the papers make sure to point out he was bludgeoned to death and was covered in "brain matter") The worst part of this story is that Tony spent most of his early life with amazing foster parents (because he was born with FAS) who showered him in love The problem is that the foster family is white whereas Tony was Native American His foster family did everything they could to keep him involved with his culture; they grew his hair long and did the traditional braids they took him to pow wows and yet the judge had him returned to his parents after they got out of prison The damn judge was quoted with saying during the hearing "Ill be damned if Ill be the first Crow judge to let a white couple adopt a Crow child" The baby spent a year being tortured by his "parents" before they murdered him This case absolutely ENRAGED me and still does https://metrocouk/2019/12/18/foster-boy-5-sad-eyes-died-covered-brains-judge-returned-jailbird-parents-11928770/,Craven_Hellsing,16230202090,77
h0w6zwj,ntofxm,I heard a story about 4 years ago that chilled me to the bone as it was so close to home My friend had an elderly mum who was being nursed by carers visiting the house everyday as she was dying Id go and sit with the old lady twice a week while my friend was at work One of these carers came while I was there one day and told the story of how her cousin and his friend both about 10 at the time were walking home across a local moor one summer evening when a car pulled up beside them Out stepped a small Scottish man and a woman with blonde hair and offered to take them home in the car that they had sweets The boys politely declined and hurried on watching the car drive on away into the distance A few years later the cousin now a grown man was watching the tv A news report came on about a couple being arrested for the kidnap and murders of multiple children Their mugshot came up and he immediately recognised them Ian Brady and Myra Hindley had taken several children raped and murdered them before burying their bodies on the northern moors of England some of which will likely never be recovered,YellowHeart84,16230613980,16
h0uf68e,ntofxm,The Hinterkaifeck Murders Hinterkaifeck was a small independent farmstead in Bavaria Germany around 70km (43 Miles) north of Munich Near the end of March 1922 the people living on began noticing more and more weird incidents A newspaper from Munich was found near the entrance to the Farmstead two weeks before the murders even though nobody on the Farm or living near it had ever bought or read it Their Neighbors noticed tracks in the snow leading to the Farmstead in the days prior several times even though none of the Inhabitants had left due to the Weather One of their door-keys suddenly vanished and the Farmer Andreas Gruber noted to Neighbors and friends several times that he could have sworn to have spotted a lone man watching the Farmstead from the edge of the forrest but nobody believed him At one point he tried to get help from others after he had hears steps on the families attic and couldnt find anybody there when he went looking but nobody believed him and so he had to return without help One of the reasons why nobody believed him was that he had been convicted of having been in an incestous relationship with his Daughter in 1915 and it was widely believed that he was the actual father of her two-year old Son Josef On the 31st of March 1922 an unknown Assailant broke into the Farmstead and murdered all 6 Inhabitants with [this farming-tool](https://imagejimcdncom/app/cms/image/transf/none/path/sc53fabfa55e420c3/image/ibb603040ded23579/version/1583149567/mordwaffe-hinterkaifeck-reuthauejpg) The Farmer Andreas Gruber his wife Czilia and their widowed Daughter Viktoria Gabriel which had moved back to the farm were all brutally beaten to death near a door leading from the Stable to the Barn The Assailant then entered the main house killed the still sleeping Maid Maria Baumgartner and finally killed Viktorias 7-year old Daughter Czilia Gabriel and her 2-year old Son Josef who was still in his crib The Assailant didnt leave immidieatly but spent another couple hours at the farm at least since cows had been milked and the entire storage of bread been eaten Even worse forensic studies concluded that the 7-year old Czilia had lived in agony for atleast another two hours after the assailant had tried to murder her Due to the farms isolated location nobody discovered the murders for another 4 days until the Neighbors grew concerned due to the family not showing up to Sunday-mass or answering when one of them had come over to help repair some machinery When the police from Munich arrived at the scenery it was noted that the Attic had covered in hay likely to damp steps and that several roof-tiles had been moved or removed allowing someone hiding on it to oversee the entire Farm with ease They also found out that it was impossible to hear what was going on in the Barn and Stable from the living room which lead them to believe that the Assailant had lured the family into the barn one-by-one and beat them to death there Despite days of thorough searching and questioning of everybody even remotely close to the farm or family a bounty of 100000 Mark for any tips leading to the arrest of the assailant and even handing the skulls of the victims over to Mediums at the end out of desparation no one was ever arrested or convicted for the Murders although a number of people were suspected The most promising suspects were: \- Karl Gabriel: Viktorias Husband had been reported killed by an artillery-shell during the Battle of Arras but after the Murders some people had claimed to have spotted him in the Area some even claiming to have talked to him He had apparently heard that his wife had another child after he "died" (the 2-year old Josef) and killed the family out of revenge The theory got some new wind after WW2 when several german PoWs from the Region upon returning home had stated that they had been questioned by a Soviet Officer with a bavarian accent while in captivity that claimed to have been Gabriel especially since some of the original witnesses claimed that Karl stated he would flee to russia after the murders Since his Comrades from WW1 insisted that he had been killed however the police dropped this lead \-Lorenz Schlittenbauer: The Mayor of the nearby village of Grbern he had been suspected to be the Father of Viktorias youngest child and to have killed the family to avoid paying child-support His house was the closest to the farm theoratically allowing him to spy on it and go back and forth between them without anyone noticing More importantly he was among the three people that discovered the Corpses While the others two were still shocked about the 4 dead bodies in the Barn Lorenz already went into the main house and audibly unlocked the main door He claimed that the key had been in the lock despite the family reporting the only key missing just a day before the murder Even years later he was suspected because during speculations in the Tavern about the murder he would sometimes refer to the murderer from as "I" and make other cryptic comments But no direct evidence was found \- Josef Brtl: A former Baker Brtl had been diagnosed with mental illnesses and been put in a mental assylum but fled from there on year earlier Since he was suspected of having taken part in another murder in 1919 and several witnesses claimed to have seen him he became a prime suspect but the police was never able to find him \- Brothers Gump: Anton Gump and three others had already been on the arrest-list of the Police in Munich due to being suspected of being involved in the murder of 9 other Farmers in Silesia during their time in a *Freikorps* and they were suspected of possibly being responsible for the Murder of the Grubers too along with Antons Brother Adolf No evidence against them was found but Antons & Adolfs Sister testified on her deathbed that her brothers had told her that they had been responsible That led to the case briefly being reopened in 1951 but ultimately no evidence was found There were also several problems with the Investigation Only 5 photos of the Place were taken and no further Evidence inside the building secured Despite one witness stating that they saw an unknown Man firing up the Farms baking-oven and the oven emitting an extremely foul and unusual stench no investigation was undertaken as to what had been burned in it The police classified it as a robbery with murder for a long time despite large sums of money that were placed openly inside the house being left untouched There was also no deeper investigation into the reasons behind the victims displaying differing degrees of wounds Viktoria had not only been beaten to death with the farmtool previously she had also been strangled while the others were killed just with blows to the head and the body of Josef being covered after he had been killed The most egregious discrepancy however was the Farmtool used to kill the family The original Police-report states that the murderweapon was found by one of three Neighbors that found the bodies in the stable However when the farm was torn down one year after the Murders the wrecking-crew discovered the actual murder-weapon hidden on the attic still covered in blood and tufts of hair Forensics also discovered that a slightly loose screw on the tool found in the attic matched the wounds on the familys head exactly which begs the question why the police initially claimed another tool was used,IronVader501,16230187050,42

h0uzzbv,ntofxm,Horrifying family story that Ive heard unsure if Ill get the particulars right but the broad strokes are correct (Ive even read an old newspaper article about it a couple years ago just to confirm that this is legit) In the early 1900s a couple and their 3 children lived in a small community in the US One weekend the kids were meant to all be visiting family out of town but one of the kids wasnt feeling well so he stayed behind with his mom and dad One of the nights that weekend a neighborhood dog was acting up and making a ton of noise on their property as it often did It was barking outside the house near the trash cans while the son who stayed behind tried to get to sleep The father was upset about the dog making so much noise all the time and decided to put an end to it via shotgun that night The mother did not approve and before he was able to get the gun out of their bedroom upstairs they got into an argument about shooting the dog The mother tried to take the shotgun from the father which led to her getting shot on accident She fell to the floor and didnt move or make any sound so in a moment of panic/guilt/repentance the father turned the gun on himself and committed suicide without hesitation The mother was roused when the second shot went off moments before the child reached the bedroom to check on all of the commotion The mother told him to run to the neighbors and get help which he did immediately The mother then crawled over to the window nearby and shattered it so she could also scream for help In shattering the window and pulling herself up to yell she also managed to cut her wrists so badly that she bled out and died before the son returned This story was buried for years in my family as they were all devoutly catholic (suicide is a huge sin which would mean the father couldnt be buried with the rest of the family) So sad and so crazy,itswaitwhat,16230297530,10

h0vq5l4,ntofxm,This is a long one Happened in my neighborhood when I was a kid Im not the original author The Luna Family In recent news it was announced that Death Row inmate Richard Djerf had been denied his last appeal Djerf had been convicted of killing four members of the Luna family in Maryvale in 1993 We have discussed this crime on TCiP a few times in bits and pieces so I decided it was about time to give it its own page here I had been following this case since it occurred and have seen some of the crime scene photos I cannot think of another crime equal in terms of innocent victims horror and cruelty Djerf actually plead guilty to four counts of capital murder his thinking being "If the judge or jury heard the details they would give me the death penalty" I agree Albert and Patricia Luna came from the copper mining region of Clifton-Morenci They married shortly after high school and intended to make a life in eastern Arizona in the mining industry A labor strike in 1983-1984 lead to problems and non-union workers being brought in Albert lost his job to a non-union worker and found difficulty finding gainful employment The family decided to leave Clifton and go to Phoenix to find work Family and friends warned them of the dangers of the big city but they were out of options and re-established themselves in west Phoenix Albert and Patricia had three children; Albert Jr 21 Rochelle 18 and Damien 5 Albert Jr had some issues with his new home town finally being arrested in 1992 for theft and burglary He also had taken to carrying a gun Rochelle was a popular outgoing girl with a job working the night shift at a grocery store Albert and Patricia were concerned for her safety but she insisted on earning money for college Damien was a typical 5-year-old and Albert Sr found steady work and was able to support his family Albert Jr worked as a night custodian at a nearby Safeway store His co-worker was Richard Djerf They were friends until January 1993 when Djerfs apartment was burglarized A television a VCR unit stereo equipment a car alarm and an AK-47 assault rifle were stolen Djerf was sure Albert Jr did it But Albert denied everything Djerf stewed and silently raged for months after Finally on September 14 1993 he decided he would take revenge Albert Jr would later admit to committing the burglary of Djerfs apartment In the late morning hours of September 14 1993 Djerf went to the Luna family home at 7202 W Monte Vista Street taking his 9mm Beretta handgun a knife latex gloves handcuffs red fuse cord and artificial flowers in a vase to use as a ruse to gain entry When Patricia answered the door to receive the flowers Djerf pushed his way into the house showing her his gun Djerf took Patricia into the master bedroom and bound her letting her five-year-old son Damien run free Later while holding Damien hostage Djerf freed Patricia and forced her to place items of property into the Luna family car including two VCR units a telephone a caller ID box a stereo CD player four watches change and a money clip with food stamps He then took Patricia and Damien into the kitchen and bound them to chairs facing each other with rope and black electrical tape More than once he asked Patricia whether she or her son should die first He also asked her if she knew the whereabouts of her son Albert Jr Around 3:00 pm Rochelle came home Djerf took Rochelle to her bedroom gagged her with tissue paper and tape tied her to the bed cut off and removed all of her clothing with a knife After raping her Djerf stabbed Rochelle four times in the chest and cut her throat At some point while still alive Rochelle vomited behind the gag and aspirated the vomit Djerf then returned to the kitchen and told Patricia he had just raped and killed her daughter Around 4:00 pm Albert Luna Sr arrived home from work Djerf handcuffed him forced him to crawl to the master bedroom and placed him face down on the bed He struck Albert in the back of the head multiple times with an aluminum baseball bat inflicting three large lacerations and spattering blood throughout the room Believing Albert to be dead he removed the handcuffs and taped his hands and wrists together leaving him on the bed He then walked to the kitchen and told Patricia that he had just killed her husband Djerf took a light fixture cut and stripped the wire and taped it to five-year old Damiens legs He flipped the switch but was unable to get the current to kill the little boy He then tried to snap Damiens neck "Like he had seen in the movies" Despite twisting the childs head all the way around he couldnt get the neck to break the same way Stallone could Meanwhile in the bedroom Albert Sr although badly injured regained consciousness and freed himself from the tape around his wrists In an effort to save his family he went to the kitchen and charged Djerf with a pocketknife wounding him seriously During the ensuing struggle Albert stabbed Djerf with enough force to drive a knife through his leg Djerf managed to pull the Beretta from his belt and shot Albert six times Albert fell to the kitchen floor and died at the feet of his wife and son Djerf was not content with just killing Patricias husband daughter and torturing her son Djerf repeatedly asked Patricia if she wanted to watch her son be killed or did she want her son to see her be killed All the time with Albert Sr lying dead at their feet Djerf finally grew tired of his game and shot both of them to death He poured gasoline over the bodies and initially intended to light it with the red fuse cord but children playing outside made him think he would be spotted when he left He put a pizza box and a rag on the stove and turned on the burners After seven hours of rape torment and butchery Djerf left the home For some reason the pizza box and rag failed to ignite the gasoline Albert Jr had not gone to his home the night of September 13 and did not return until 11:45 pm Numerous unanswered calls to the house had made him anxious When Albert Jr entered the home and discovered the bodies of his parents and brother he immediately left and drove to his girlfriends house where he called the police After murdering the Lunas Djerf went back to his apartment and had his girlfriend Elizabeth Boswell drive him to the hospital to get the injuries he received from Albert Sr treated He initially said he had been stabbed during a robbery attempt but admitted to her he committed the killings the following day Djerf told Boswell that he had murdered four members of the Luna family

h0ue76l,ntofxm,[The Hinterkaifeck murders](https://enwikipediaorg/wiki/Hinterkaifeck_murders) The Hinterkaifeck murders occurred on the evening of March 31 1922 in which six inhabitants of a small Bavarian farmstead located approximately 70 km north of Munich Germany were murdered by an unknown assailant They were found struck dead The perpetrator lived with the 6 corpses of their victims for 3 days The murders are considered one of the most gruesome and puzzling unsolved crimes in German history Strange things began to occur in and around Hinterkaifeck sometime shortly before the attack Six months before the attack the family maid quit It has been widely claimed that her reason for leaving was that she had heard strange sounds in the attic and believed the house to be haunted Andreas Gruber found a strange newspaper from Munich on the property in March 1922 He could not remember buying it and initially believed that the postman had lost the newspaper[3] This was not the case however as no one in the vicinity subscribed to the paper[4] Just days before the murders Gruber told neighbours he discovered tracks in the fresh snow that led from the forest to a broken door lock in the farms machine room[3] Later during the night they heard footsteps in the attic but Gruber found no one when he searched the building Although he told several people about these alleged observations he refused to accept help and the details went unreported to the police[3] According to a school friend of the seven-year-old Czilia Gabriel the young girl reported that her mother Viktoria had fled the farm the night before the act after a violent quarrel and only hours later had been found in the forest[5] March 31  April 1 1922 On the afternoon of March 31 1922 a Friday the new maid Maria Baumgartner arrived at the farm Marias sister had escorted her there and left the farm after a short stay[3] She was most likely the last person to see the inhabitants alive It appears that in the late evening Viktoria Gabriel her seven-year-old daughter Czilia and her parents Andreas and Czilia were lured to the family barn through the stable where they were murdered one at a time[3] The perpetrator (or perpetrators) used a mattock belonging to the family farm and killed the family with blows to the head The perpetrator moved into the living quarters where - with the same murder weapon - he killed Josef sleeping in his bassinet and Baumgartner in her bedchamber[6] Discovery Four days passed between the murders and the discovery of the bodies On April 1 coffee sellers Hans Schirovsky and Eduard Schirovsky arrived in Hinterkaifeck to take an order When no one responded to the knocks on the door and the window they walked around the yard but found no one They only noticed that the gate to the machine house was open before they decided to leave[7] Czilia Gabriel was absent without excuse for the next few days of school and the family failed to show up for Sunday worship[6] Assembler Albert Hofner went to Hinterkaifeck on April 4 to repair the engine of the food chopper He stated that he had not seen any of the family and had heard nothing but the sounds of the farm animals and the dog inside the barn After waiting for an hour he decided to start his repair which he completed in roughly 45 hours[3] Around 3:30 PM Lorenz Schlittenbauer sent his son Johann (16) and stepson Josef (9) to Hinterkaifeck to see if they could make contact with the family When they reported that they did not see anyone Schlittenbauer headed to the farm the same day with Michael Pll and Jakob Sigl[6] Entering the barn they found the bodies of Andreas Gruber his wife Czilia Gruber his daughter Viktoria Gabriel and his granddaughter Czilia murdered in the barn Shortly after they found the chamber maid Maria Baumgartner and the youngest family member Viktorias son Josef murdered in the home[6],rexmons,16230182360,5

h0urfrq,ntofxm,The Hinterkaifeck murders one of Germanys oldest unsolved murder cases from the early 1920s (Im writing this from memory so apologies if there are any mistakes) Its wintertime and a farmer in southern Germany comes across a set of footprints in the snow leading from the edge of the forest to his barn but cant see any footprints leading away A search of the premises turns up nothing Over the next week or two odd things begin to happen: the farmer finds an unfamiliar newspaper lying around that neither he nor any of his neighbours bought or have a subscription to The family also begins hearing footsteps in the attic at night but when they go to investigate nothing can be found Then one Sunday they fail to show up at church This is uncharacteristic and the neighbours immediately begin to suspect that something is wrong When they finally go to check on the family all of them are found dead: the farmer and his wife their daughter the daughters two infant children and a woman employed by the family as a maid Five of the six were found in the barn and had been murdered in the most brutal way by being hacked to death with a mattock (an agricultural tool a bit like a pickaxe) One of the babies was found in his cot with his throat slit The really creepy bit is that the subsequent investigation determined that the murderer stayed in the house for a few days after he had killed them all Neighbours saw smoke coming from the farmhouses chimneys the animals had been fed and watered there was freshly cut meat in the pantry and someone had eaten about three or four days worth of bread No motive was ever discovered and the crime was never solved,SlefeMcDichael,16230250940,6

h121yry,ntofxm,The story of the Japanese people from the beginning of World War II to the end of the war and to this day its something then Ill believe its terrifying of what actually happened The fact that the atomic bombs not only saved many Americans but the fact that the atomic bombs actually saved the entire civilization of Japan from complete corruption that would have eventually led to the complete collapse and disintegration of the Japanese culture Using bits and pieces from first person sources and third the Japanese in World War Two or one of the most rape and pillage societies to exist ever This is not something I like to think about it is not something that I enjoy trying to tell other people about At the beginning of World War II Adolf Hitler was not in favor of becoming allies with the Japanese what so ever Even with the beginning of the genocide of the Jewish people in Germany it was known that the Japanese were completely sexually ruthless when it came to moving in and taking over another County The Nazis believed the Japanese were insane and crazy Adolf Hitler actually believed that the kamikaze attack method was absolutely a disgrace and not something that was at all a way to fight a war It was known that the Japanese army would be sent a constant supply chain of Japanese prostitutes whom had been brainwashed into believing that allowing hundreds of men to sexually do whatever they please to them was in the best interest of the country Even with this many children in China and women were sexually assaulted to extend that you and I can hardly believe in refused at some extent that it actually happened Due to the fact that the Japanese were able to have a very powerful industrial military complex what is the factor that led the Nazis to become allies when they had realized America was joining the war The best way I can explain this is to imagine North Korea today Religion for bidden outside news and information not allowed The Japanese people were being brainwashed into believing their emperor was God Therefore anything the emperor said was holy and righteous The atomic bombs that finally entered the war not only created a new beginning but also saved the Japanese from the continuing to fight and not thinking about how insane the disturbing propaganda forced upon them would have led to Japan destroying itself completely If the bombs had not fallen the amount of Japanese civilians who would have eventually died and the number of family that would have been destroyed would be incomprehensible The Japanese spacebelieved that it was their duty to their emperor "God" to continue fighting no matter what the amount of people who then would have died in Japan would be 10 times or more greater than what the atomic bombs did This information is hard to digest and comprehend due to the fact that the bombs were so tragic and devastating but without them there would have been a much much more hellacious outcome for the entire country of Japan and if they did not use the bombs at all Truth is the Japanese were suddenly awaken and saw how wrong they had been led for so many years The Japanese are very strong and very ambitious at ensuring their country is running smoothly And the warnfinally ended the time that it took for 99% of the Japanese population to understand that their belief of what reality was had been a lie The time that it took for 99% of the population to immediately re-calibrate their perspective of reality is astonishing In less than two years the Japanese viewed America as a hero and would consider America ally from that day forward The lives that were lost during World War II are countless and it was an absolute incredible devastation for everyone no one had it easy But the fact that the Japanese were able to recover and immediately realize they had been brainwashed They knew and understood that America had come to help them create a new society that would be better than anything they ever had they soon started rebuilding alongside with the US military and contractors to rebuild their society to become greater than it had ever been before To view the atomic bomb as a device that actually saved more people than you could possibly imagine at the sacrifice of so many lives just seems to be in an impossible thought But this was the truth of the Japanese in World War II It is beautiful that we have one of the strongest relationships with Japan to this day and that the population welcomes Americans to visit and absolutely believes The culture of western civilization Is positive and joyful and peaceful shows how something so tragic can bring a wonderful Outcome in the end I highly respect the people of Japan it was not their fault they had become slaves due to extreme suppressing leader ship just as North Korea is today and also How Russia was completely put into slavery due to Stalin Executing countless Russians in the 1950s These were people who fought in the Russian army to defend their country these were people who sacrificed everything to ensure Russia would not fall to the Nazis or the Japanese It didnt matter if you were hero From World War II Stalin committed genocide against his own people regardless of who they were No one was safe Now you can understand with a Japanese were going through with their emperor in World War II We save them from an emperor who was completely out of control General MacArthur did one of the most righteous acts you could have done he for gave the emperor he told the Japanese people to forgive the emperor The emperor was allowed to remain as emperor however under a completely new government and society believes taught by the United States after peace had finally come General MacArthur explained to many Japanese civilians not to follow him but you forgive and start new with a new set of democratic principles and a democracy I find this to be one of the most amazing events that there is hope for all of humanity if something so tragic turned out to set a path of a new prosperous journey for an entire civilization to me this is terrifying For it is so hard to except and understand how the events played out in this manner when it is not discussed or talked about at all today but it is something that should be known and remembered so in the future Other civilians of a suppressed communist dictator ship Who believe that you are the enemy can be shown a way of peace and prosperity I hope what I have stated and said doesnt make sense it is something that many may refuse to even consider the idea of and I can understand that it is not an easy pill to swallow but it is something that happened Thank you for your time I hope I have been able to bring a perspective to you if you did not know this before or had thought that it was a complete devastating thing to drop the atomic bombs,TheEmpathyEngineer,16231759390,15

h0uls4x,ntofxm,I am from a third world country and we have several rivers that are cutting through the whole country from end to end One day when I was about 16 or 17 I was walking by the river going to the "city" I saw a little canoe right in the middle of the river going a lot slower than the actual current of the river like something heavy was slowing it down I thought of doing something nice so decided to swim to it use it to cross to the other side to get to the city quicker and then just leave it by the shore for the owner to hopefully find it Got to it barely climed into it Tried to use the paddles to take it to the shore but it was so heavy and barely moved Looked to the other side and noticed that the fishing net was actually dropped into the water as if someone was fishing Back there our fishing nets are different from what I have seen here in the west ours were about 5 yards high and at least 200 yards long anyway it is weird but I thought why not just pull the net and see what it is stuck on hopefully that that would help make the canoe lighter So I started pulling the net kept pulling and pulling until something popped up then disappeared It was really heavy Pulled it hard and then two human feet popped out At this moment I think I almost shit my pants I then let them go took a deep breath and pulled them back up I was freaking out but held on the net with the human body tangled into it Managed to pull the whole body towards me flip it around and get the head close to the edge of the canoe and held on to it until I got some help or something It was an older man with a deep whole on the top of his head where I can literally see his brain It was like as if he was shot by a 50 caliber straight down the top of his head The scene was absolutely horrific especially for a teenager There were a couple of adults on the other side of the river I screamed at them for help They had boats with engines to them so they came to check on me and saw what I found They saw the state I was in one of them took me to the shore and the other one took over I went on with my day and left them with the body Later on that week I got the news that police was called and the body was taken to the hospital Turned out it was an older fisherman who was fishing during the night There were high voltage powerlines that cross the river in multiple areas in our town He happened to be fishing when the rivers water was higher than normal due to rain so the surface of the water was really close to those powerlines The poor man hit one of those lines with his head while wet and got fried instantly His family had been looking for him for about a week then,kalzEOS,16230220830,1

The original Paris Agreement temperature goal was to keep global temperatures under **2C** of pre-industrial levels preferably to **15C** However in the press conference announcing the report the IPCC admitted that we need *every* country to *perfectly* hit their Paris Agreement emission goals to prevent going over ***25C*** of pre-industrial levels by the end of the century **[No country is doing enough to hit the targets set in the Paris Agreement](https://wwwindependentcouk/climate-change/news/paris-agreement-climate-change-policy-tracker-b1766928html)** The authors of the 2021 IPCC report now believe that 15C will be reached within the next 10-20 years ***in all scenarios*** And if we dont take extreme measures (we wont) a realistic estimate is closer to 5-10 years Again 15C was the original Paris Agreement temperature goal 25C is now our **best-case scenario** (read: impossible) The effects of going over 15C will be catastrophic but even at 2C: - Severe heat events will become 26x worse - Plant and vertebrate species loss 2x worse - Insect species loss 3x worse - Decline in marine fisheries 2x worse Rather than 70% to 90% of coral reefs dying 99% will die Many vulnerable and low-lying areas will become uninhabitable and refugee flows will *radically* increase At 25C (our new **best-case scenario** if everyone everywhere does everything *perfectly*) these effects become considerably worse and climate change will be absolutely devastating for large swathes of the globe ###Were talking about a scale of destruction and a body count that our limited human minds cannot fathom right now Human civilization will have to be fundamentally rebuilt Thats how our world will look by the end of the century in our *best-case* scenario Reality is far far worse than the media is reporting ###It gets even worse though Even if there *was* a meaningful reduction in emissions were about to reach a tipping point with the Amazon forest where weve clearcut so much of it that it will no longer provide the CO2 mitigating effects the planet so desperately needs Experts warn that soon the water cycle will become irreversibly broken locking in a trend of declining rainfall and longer dry seasons that began decades ago (a positive feedback loop of destruction) **At least half of the shrinking forest will give way to savanna** With as much as 17% of the forest lost already scientists believe that **the tipping point will be reached at 20% to 25% of deforestation** even if climate change is tamed At the current rate of deforestation 27% of the Amazon will be lost by ***2030*** In addition as the Arctic ice sheets melt away completely in the summer massive amounts of CO2 that was trapped deep within that ice will be released (along with the likelihood of releasing all kinds of unspeakably horrifying pre-historic viruses we know nothing about and have no defense for) creating yet another positive feedback loop that kicks this shit into 4th gear even if we *do* somehow find the will to curb our own emissions in a meaningful way The oceans absorb 1/3 of humanitys CO2 emissions and 90% of the excess heat generated by increased greenhouse gas emissions In addition the oceans hold about 60x more CO2 than the atmosphere Caps of frozen CO2 or methane called "hydrates" contain these potent greenhouse gases keeping them from escaping into the ocean and atmosphere But the ocean is warming as CO2 emissions continue to rise and scientists say the temperature of the seawater surrounding some hydrate caps is **within a few degrees of dissolving them** Our leaders have a plan to get this all under control though *Right?* Most policies to prevent climate collapse are planned somewhere in 2050 the more progressive ones in 2030 It turns out according to an IPCC report due out *next* year [that leaked a few weeks ago](https://wwwtheguardiancom/environment/2021/aug/12/greenhouse-gas-emissions-must-peak-within-4-years-says-leaked-un-report): ###We only have until 2025 (less than 4 years) > Current investment falls below what is needed "by a factor of five" even to hold warming to the higher limit of 2C according to the report Heres the thing that theyre not explicitly stating: ###The true warming of the planet is already 19 C *at the very least* The IPCC says weve had 11C of mean change but [TS-29 says that "aerosol masking" caused global cooling of up to 08C](https://wwwipccch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_TSpdf) which is the smog were putting out from burning fossil fuels **Ironically our own pollution is keeping us cooler (for now)** Yeah This is that earth-shattering "OH SHIT" moment you see in every disaster movie when the scientists realize that things are even worse than their worst-case scenarios predicted Were not fucked **Were super duper fucked** As soon as we switch to greener energy sources we get that debt repaid and fast like a rubber band snapping back We may already be seeing this The sudden warming record high temperatures and massive wildfires we experienced this year could be due to a reduction of aerosols *last* year (largely due to the pandemic and related shutdowns) But its important to realize that the IPCC and others have kept moving the baseline forward If we were still going by the 1750 baseline **we are already at 2C** even without factoring in aerosol masking Its only if you use 1850 or 1880 as a baseline that you can get some of these delusional numbers like 11C ###But wait It gets even *worse* The climate models [in the IPCCs own report](https://wwwipccch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPMpdf) from 2014 predict were currently on track for a heating of somewhere between 3C and 4C by the end of the century But even these projections are all far too conservative optimistic and simply do not align with reality [The IPCCs own data](https://wwwcarbonbrieforg/what-is-a-4c-world) shows that in their conservative "worst-case scenario" (the A1FI scenario) we are absolutely headed for: - A 15C world within the next 5-10 years (were nearly at 12C already according to their math) - A 25C world in 30 years - ***A 4C to 64C world (read: guaranteed human extinction) in 80 years*** The scientists know this The IPCC knows this (which is why they admitted as much in the draft of the 2021 report) Id be willing to bet a large percentage of policymakers know this ###The Bottom Line If were going to actually face reality we have to acknowledge that were actually heading to 8C and above to whatever the equilibrium will become once we are dead and our emissions stabilize,ThePriceOfPunishment,16302755810,15

h0du1h1,nq9fjc,Heres a good story for you all: Went to a very famous and very fancy 5 star hotel in the 1990s on a trip to south of Europe in a very famous royal city paid for by a very wealthy friend-of-a-friend (they paid for everything!) where the guests and staff were incredible and stunning to say the least in both quality of service AND THEIR LOOKS! I met up with a young VERY VERY ATTRACTIVE European woman guest a few years younger than I was at the time at an outside-of-hotel bistro and we really hit it off! Total chemistry was there right away and both of us were smitten! Fast forward a few days later and after some lunches dinners and sightseeing we suddenly had to fulfill our primal urges with awesome naked fun multiple times with this lovely woman who has now become this very-very-famous female personality who just wanted a big and tall brutish-looking guy like me at that moment in time For over three weeks we enjoyed the local sights and it was with some reluctance we both knew we had to part ways where she went to her glamorous and wealthy life and I went back to my much-less well-heeled but much lower media-exposure position We did not see or contact each other again afterwards While acting discreet Im still kind of hard to miss and I was surprised that we were able to "hide" everything from her minders and handlers at the time where nobody ever bothered us She wasnt really famous THEN BUT she and her parents were very well-connected and wealthy which is why security was so tight Fast-forward many years and I am looking at some European front-page news pages and I am ASTONISHED to see in the news a now very famous mid-40s face and the faces of her now young-adult stunning-looking twin children (one male one female) The shock of realizing they BOTH have my eyes and facial expressions was quite disconcerting to see It seems there was a twin realization of our dalliance so long ago and I was never informed Shes far too famous and rich now for me to be raising a stink about it BUT I do must raise a glass in personal pride that such beautiful progeny came out of our wild times together in that royal city 5-star hotel so many years ago AND YES I would LOOOOOOVE to re-connect with our now very very famous lady! She is an incredible looker today and I can say today that her naked body would be just as beautiful NOW as it was then! We STILL have enough time to make some more beautiful babies if shes open to it! jjm,CodanWarrior,16226819350,2

gwzkmcc,n4vf1p,I had so many phases as a teenager One of my favorites was my naturalist phase At one point I decided I was going to be a naturalist because I loved animals and nature I collected all the dead animal artifacts my local Tennessee woods could offer and opened up a nature museum in my parents unused shed I studied labeled and mounted each of the artifacts and created themed exhibits (woodlands ocean geology etc) People from my church and neighborhood would pay $20 a year to receive a monthly newsletter and see monthly exhibits Non members were charged $1 I bought some taxidermy and artifacts and friends and family donated some specimens as well My humble museum even boasted international members (my aunt and grandparents in Japan) I started when I was 8 and ended the museum when I was 14 once I started working at an actual lab I had quite a sizeable collection that I believe my parents threw away as soon as I left for college Taxidermy and mounted skeletons of foxes weasels birds rodents and other creatures Some bought some donated and some I had done by myself (my cat provided plenty of practice moles and rats) Other notable specimens included an entire dried Stingray horseshoe crabs a mummified rabbit I found in the woods deer pelts various antlers organs snakes and amphibians preserved in jars I also had some live animals I kept for short periods of time as a zoo of sorts Wild mice I caught and a variety of insects frogs pond creatures and snakes I caught kept alive studied for a few months before releasing them I even had a sick raccoon possum and red tailed hawk at one point Im fairly certain that raccoon was rabied I caught all three of them trying to kill my chickens and decided they were fair game to keep and nurse to health I eventually released them in some woods far away once they were healthy There were also gemstone plant and rock collections Also hundreds of posters I created where I drew different natural processes and explanations of different natural phenomenon and animal facts It was a proper little nature museum My parents bought me all the books I could want on animals nature and naturalist how tos I loved reading about all kinds of animals rocks and plants I would spend hours watching and identifying birds and other wildlife in the woods I remember sitting completely still for hours patiently waiting underneath the feeder for a hummingbird to land on my hand I still love nature and wildlife and would love to be a naturalist I went on to get a degree in Biology and Chemistry and worked in labs for 7 years Unfortunately I realized that the jobs I wanted were few and far between and the pay was barely a living wage I now volunteer with a wyoming wildlife conservation group and spend as much time outside as possible while going back to school for a real job It remains one of my fondest childhood memories,Current_Elk_550,16201867420,8

He couldnt even be carried up the stairs because he had severe spinal problems that meant that his back chest and internal organs were pretty squashed and he had to be moved very carefully He was one very sick wee boy and there was no way he was getting up to the studio He was totally out of luck on that one No he wasnt though was he? Because it occurred to me he could tape his programme with one of the portable recorders we had (little Marantz high-speed cassette recorder) give me a track listing and Id cut it together play it to him and if he was happy wed play it out for him He wouldnt get to do it live but next best thing eh? So we did I dropped off the tape recorder microphone and so on and a day or so later I collected it from him with his running order track list and a stack of CDs Perfect He even sounded like hed really bashed on his script and sounded pretty damn good Copy the tape to 1/4" copy the tunes to 1/4" edit it down and boom Except! He had a cold A snuffly snottery cold Every sentence was punctuated with <SNIIFFF> <SNURK> <SNUMPH> snotty noises I can tell you now that a <SNIIIFFF> is about |---------------------------------| that long on 3-3/4 inch per second 1/4" tape and also cats absolutely love to play with all this brown tickertape confetti youre flooding the bedroom (where my editing gear was) with and there were dozens of them Eighteen hours of cutting sticking redubbing finding a bit of dead air juuuust the right tone to fill the gap cutting sticking But when his programme went to air?

h5hid69,olspwd,Probably gonna get buried but once coming late from work (2-3am) I stumbled upon a man completly naked well with a ski mask casually jogging with his huge dong jumping around IT WAS WINTER not that running naked is normal in the summer but you know And I mean canadian 15 cm snow -20c winter I remember wondering what the fuck was going on when I realised there was a masked naked man running in my direction but he just awkwardly looked my way and then down like ashamed Found out later he was a serial dickrunner and there was a couple of news articles on him he was seen on the same street,Vinche114,16264992770,189
h5hbprg,olspwd,When i was in my early 20s i used to go jogging at midnight around a small/medium sized lake after work The place was in the middle of the city so it wasnt inherently scary One night i smell a dead animal in one spot Over the course of two weeks the smell gets worse and worse every night until i actually had to start crossing the street in that section A few days later im watching the nightly news and apparently that day they had found a missing woman dead and decomposing right at the spot I stopped jogging there at night,deeezwalnutz,16264947930,18
h5knh5q,olspwd,I usually take the day after Halloween off work every year since even if there isnt some party I just like staying up late for the spooky vibes One year I didnt have much to do so I decided to go for a wall through one of the nearby large city parks at ~2am In the middle of one of the soccer fields I see something odd As I walk closer to it I see that its a classical flying saucer probably about 15 feet diameter wedged into the field as if it had crashed Im talking a big pile of dirt over one edge of it smoke/steam coming off the thing and the central dome on the sources glowing various different colours As I get nearer to the thing I notice movement out of the corner of my eyes and I begin to see a couple dozen people all dressed in black suits with sunglasses on approaching from out of the wooded area at the edge of the field At that point I decided I was way too high for this shit and booked it out of there To this day Im not really sure what it was The most logical explanation to me is some kind of Halloween flash mob kind of thing but Ive never been able to find any mention of it in the news or online and when I went back the next day there was no trace that anything had happened at all,rampop,16265678250,16
h5h9m05,olspwd,Scarier in retrospect I was on my university campus and heading back from a pretty late study group something I did pretty frequently Im a young male so (stupidly) I saw no problem doing this alone I turn the corner and start walking the pathway that goes between two bigger buildings thd fastest way to the street my apartment is on Pretty soon I see Im not alone theres a guy maybe a 150-200 feet at the other end of the path Almost immediately after seeing him I know hes "not right" Weird posture lurching gait and I hear a low muttering of word salad I assume its a drunk homeless guy Not wanting to have an unpleasant interaction I decide to steer clear I back a few steps guy doesnt seem to notice me and I take a roundabout way to my apartment Something about it rubbed me the wrong way The homeless are usually pitiful folks with mental health and or substance abuse issues and whilet they sometimes get in your face panhandling are more annoying and depressing than aggressivem But its odd to see one near the university buildings at this time of night usually theyre near the nightlife spots panhandling So I keep thinking about it as I walk home and soon as Im home I call the campus security folks and give them a heads up about what I saw I dont think much of it the next day or after until Im scanning the campus newspaper and the police blotter the next week Turns out the guy was actually someone with a history of mental illness and had attacked a female student in the past He had a restraining order against being on university property and when confronted tried to assault the university officer Again not a guarantee hed have done anything to me but glad I listened to my gut,CasualAwful,16264934950,44

h69u984,olspwd,I was south of Seattle a town called Renton and just got groceries on my way home (I ride the bus) and just coming out of the store this lady comes from the other side of the parking lot past 2 dudes and comes to me and super calm and casually asks if I have a phone I say yes She asks me again super calmly to call 911 Instant PTSD Everyone Ive ever called 911 for has died But ok sure If you want to take my curse so be it I ask her whats going on she said theres someone in the woods that isnt responding and that she left her phone in the woods And im like Ok She says "ok Im Gunna go back now" and she heads for the woods as Im calling 911 I am sticking to the entrance of that store like glue in case she tried anything weird and I told the people at 911 the story the cops show up I tell them about this super fishy incident I have no idea where in the woods this lady went and I was absolutely not going to follow her Why didnt she ask the 2 dudes she passed for help to call 911? Why me? Why so calm? Why go back in the woods and not wait to show the police where to go? Why was her phone in the woods? It just felt like some kind of weird trap The police told me I could go so I started the long walk from qfc to my bus stop I was so scared she was Gunna run out from the woods with a gun or something I booked it and kept looking behind me I never heard anything about what happened that night nothing in the news at all This was late 2019 Out of my year and a half in Seattle this is the weirdest and scariest thing to happen to me,MondoCat,16270621190,7

h5hkkyt,olspwd,Not sure how scary to consider it To me its justthe impact of how easily it could be anyone About 2 years back walking home around midnight The areas quiet closed communities only 2 road entrances Very low traffic both on foot and vehicle I was crossing from a footpath alley to the field I walk through and hear something to my right loud enough to be head through my headphones I habitually pull them down having had some unpleasant moments in the past with surprises at night Guy was walking down the middle of the road with just thei wanna say purest but its not rightpurest breakdown crying I have ever heard That deep from the bottom of your soul crying sobbing and just anguish I paused weighed my options and called out "guy theres a bench over there Need to talk?" He stopped looks to me and says with a weirdly solid tone "It wont bring them back" then continues on Legit I have never felt sounsettled I spent a bit of time the next morning checking the news but didnt see anything obvious like pair killed in car accident or something I really wish I could helped the guy somehow cause that kinda hurt is in itself scary to think about For all I know bud was having a super bad trip or lost family Either way its stuck with me,XionLord,16265009050,7
h61m7rn,olspwd,Grew up in a fairly large Midwest town 550k population we lived in a very residential area I would walk my dog at night before going to bed I was around 14 or 15 at this time I knew the area we were walking it was one of our usual routes by some old train tracks turned into a paved bike path For some reason about a dozen or so over the overhead lights above the path were out Between them was an old path between a park and some homes that were covered tunnels We would typically walk through the one towards the homes and then Id loop back home on the sidewalk For whatever reason that night as we got about 50ft or so from the tunnel my dog stopped hair went up and she went in front of me and started growling If I walked forward she pushed against me and blocked me She was a German Shepherd Border Collie Husky mix about 55-60lbs After a couple of minutes I decided to just turn back the way we want She kept looking back and occasionally stopped and would growl or bark I never saw or heard anything or anyone Nothing ever in the news and my school friends who would walk through that tunnel in the morning to get to school said there was no signs of anyone who had been there,Babylon4All,16268984280,6

h5idbfc,olspwd,I didnt "see" it per say I work a weird early third shift so I get home around 3am and take a half n hour to an hour walk when I get home My neighborhood is quite large and has a large park area in the middle of it Usually Ill cut through it to get to the other side of the neighborhood and loop back around The park has a pavilion area and a restroom/splash pad areas thats lit up even at night But this one particular night it just wasnt no idea why This will become somewhat relevant later Now Im not afraid of the dark by any means I walk at night through a hardly lit neighborhood after all haha But as I was about to take the little path down to cut through as I do every night the hairs on my neck started standing up and my gut started churning and telling me "Dont you go down there!" My heart started racing and adrenaline kicked in and everything in those started screaming DANGER! DANGER! DO NOT GO!" It was weird how fast it just happened One second Im fine just chilling and listening to music quietly like I do every night next second fight or flight is going off hardcore The pavilion area is dark as hell even by night time standards It was a half moon give or take from memory so it wouldnt have been that dark I trusted my gut sure enough and just turned around and quickly walked home checking behind me every few mins The next day on the news there was a report someone had been stabbed/beaten to death in that park area overnight I dunno if I was going to walk in on the murder and our weird human 6th sense picked up on the weird violent energy or if it had already happened and the person was dead and the murderer was leaving my way and would have hurt/killed me to silence me as well or what I never heard any screams or any sort of struggle Even listening to music I keep it low enough to hear a car passing and someone being stabbed to death is probably quite loud Thankfully they found the person relatively quickly and hes off the streets Ive still no idea why the lights were out in that pavilion that particular night I do this walk every night and its not like they go off at a certain time or day of the week I took a couple nights off from walking but since then Ive gone back to it and never had anything strange happen Ill occasionally pass another walker or people playing on the jungle gym stuff in the dark but always felt safe,Goatman_Jack,16265253670,3

Second thing that happened was when i went drinking with a date I got on the bus after the date completely drunk and fell asleep I only woke up at the last stop I got out of the bus and saw a woman lying on her back sprawling and motionless on the ground I saw some random people around so i just grabbed her propped her up and found a nearby taxi stand She was semi awake when i put her in the taxi but she gave me a cold stare I took a look at the taxi drivers badge just in case anything made the news later I thought i did a good deed that night - it was scary as if the wrong guy was there it would have gone wrong for the poor woman,Xercen,16265367030,3

ht00kyi,s5m4up,Nothing current but I have a great one from 5 years ago: So we had a guy who was quite the Libertarian He owned a gun store in town and pretty much kept to himself He will be known as LibGuy The problem started when he decided to have chickens for his own eggs but he lived within the city proper which had a rule against farm animals within the city (this is a rural farming area I live in) One of the city council members (he shall be known as A-hole) discovered he had chickens a few weeks after he got them and the city sent him a letter telling him he had to get rid of them Well he was not going to go down without a fight So he spent some time looking into things and discovered the A-hole who reported him lived within the city and he also had chickens Well this of course caused a bit of a scandal The city ended up claiming there was a grandfather clause for anyone who had livestock within the city prior to the rule change 17 years ago The problem with that was that clause applied to the A-holes father not the A-hole who lived at the same address Needless to say the war was on! A couple of weeks go by and the town cops are messing with Libguy over petty shit Libguy somehow gets a recording of A-hole calling the police and lying to them about what Libguy was doing Police now want to charge Libguy for some absurd ridiculous recording law that really doesnt apply since it was someone with the police dept who gave him the tape not that he stole it This gets blown up to the point where the bigger cities news crews are now showing up to city council meetings that are being called to address this issue These meetings are getting absurdly blown out of proportion and in all honesty somewhat slimy and jicky in how the city is handling it Libguy subpoenas the city council emails to show there was a concerted effort to fuck with him and cover for A-hole Well in the course of getting the Emails it was discovered that there was a sexting issue going on between three of the city council members LMAO believe me when I say this did not involve people that would be considered sexy all three (2 women and 1 male) were married 200lbs plus and in their 50s I mean Emails about double-dildos pegging swingingetcIt was hilarious In the end the Libguy got the last laugh he lost his chickens but found a loophole where he could actually own Llamas in the city since they were not considered [livestock So](https://livestockSo) he put up a fence all around his yard (ugly chicken wire fence) just tall enough so the Llamas could not get out by jumping People actually would go by walking their dogs and pet the Llamas The problem though was that Llamas shit like cows and it stinks in such a small enclosure This went on for about a year until he sold his house and moved (it stunk for at least a block around his property and he lived right behind the towns grocery store) Two of the council members involved got divorced over the sexting issue and the third one sold her bar because of it This was the infamous chicken scandal that plagued my town of 4K for 3 years,blgiant,16423945800,3032

An older woman donated her nutcracker collection to the historical society Something like 2500 nutcrackers I think because her kids told her flat out they would dispose of them after she died if she did not make alternate arrangements So the town decided well they had all these nutcrackers on display This could be good for tourism We could be known for something People were bewildered and predictably upset A lot of townsfolk dont *want* to be the nutcracker town All the local businesses have been pressured to buy these giant expensive cardboard nutcrackers from the local print shop They are *terrifying* Theres been general outcry Facebook groups the whole nine yards And still the town persists Still there are these hollow-eyed giant cartoonish cardboard nutcrackers everywhere you look Edit: Someone guessed it so I have effectively triangulated myself (internet safety fail 101) If you want to see some local news on the subject [look no further](https://wwwkelolandcom/news/eye-on-keloland/history-center-hopes-to-have-more-nutcrackers-than-people-in-luverne/) Edit 2: Okay since many people have asked (and not everyone can access the news sites) Ive attempted to upload a picture of [the cardboard nutcrackers](https://iimgurcom/lVQ9zUdjpg) Let me know if it doesnt work and Ill give it another go!,sleepyhollow_101,16423720770,16316

hszgspk,s5m4up,School board has announced a public meeting to discuss switching from 5-day to 4-day per week school there is already one "teacher work day" per month (either a Friday or a Monday connected to a holiday) where there is no school Rich parents think its going to lower property taxes --- it will not because the school board will just find another place to spend the money (like the fancy baseball stadium and sports complex lighting they just added) Poor parents think its going to break them to have to arrange child care for 3-4 additional days per month -- it likely willthere is no infrastructure for it Grandparents are worried that 40% of the school kids qualify for free or reduced lunches and that means that those kids will miss two meals per day for 3-4 days more per month The "buddy pack" weekend food bank program is not prepared to add an additional days worth of food for the kids receiving the backpacks Students think theyll get 3-4 more days a month to play --- theyll really have 3-4 weeks per month where learning is squeezed into less classroom time and there will be fewer class-units per semester so fewer electives for the high schoolers Teachers know theyll get screwed either way --- just because the kids arent in the classroom doesnt mean the administration wont require them to be in classroom doing other tasks including deep-cleaning their own classrooms to prohibit the spread of covid The same classroom where they are legally prevented from enforcing a mask mandate The lunch ladies dont give a shit because theyve already contracted out feeding the kids and none of the food is prepared locally --- just dished out by increasingly bitter part-time-working retirees The bus drivers are the only ones who will "win" except theyll have to pick up another side gig to off set the loss of 6 hours of minimum wage work per week The good news? Both faith-based schools in town have announced that they will continue to schedule all classes 5 days per week and our state legislature wont let go of opportunities to vote in school vouchers that will take money from public schools and give it to the faith-based private schools Prior to this debate/debacle and covid the school districts standardized test scores were higher for a five-year average than theyve ever been ---- kids were actually being educated and going to college and trade schools instead of McDs or the factory I guess they figured it was time to dumb-down the populace again and start with the next generation of voters,Lybychick,16423856160,28

Apparently for a while now!! I dont know how it got out but honestly thats probably why the kid seemed to be a little off The whole family always had a strange vibe and my mom would never let me around them without her there lmao So yeah i dunno what "perfect church" did about it but chances are its a big hush hush type deal because they either sweep things under the rug or make you publicly announce them in front of everyone to admit that you did something wrong Glad i dont go there anymore,metathena1,16423813820,3

ht22cve,s5m4up,TL;DR: City has been ignoring one of its ordinances regarding mandatory guard rails around specific types of fountains and all types of water reservoirs for almost 7 years Took 3 accidents (one involving the death of a child) over the past 7 years to get them to put a dinky ass rail next to the fountain Full story: My brother works for a local news station Hes only a cinematographer/editor yet hes been researching and uncovering a story for the past couple weeks We have a huge fountain in the middle of our market area that sits at the bottom of a decently sized slope just off the highway that cuts through our town Well while doing research my brother found out that there was an official ordinance regarding fountains in particular that stated something along the lines of (paraphrasing here) "any fountain and/or water system that is 1 Linked with the main piping infrastructure of the city; and 2 Sits below 30 centimeters (or inches I cant remember but this definitely sits well below 30 inches) must have a guard rail" Well its been almost 7 years since that ordinance was put into place Only now are we getting a guard rail Why is this a big deal? Well 3 accidents occurred in that span of time 2 of which involved people that got charged with a "DUI" and the other was a city work that was having to mow this steep lawn right next to the water You can guess how that ended Only one (of the 3 we know of at least) resulted in death Turns out a guy I work with (Ill call him Jim) and whom my brother also used to work with has a brother himself (Ill call him Bob) Bob was driving his kid home in heavy rain one day The officials say bob was intoxicated lost control crashed into the fountain and showed no signs of attempting to help his kid after only saving himself resulting in the childs death Well Bobs family called complete bs Supposedly Bob is much like Jim in the sense that they wont even touch alcohol The family says Bob hydro-planed and lost control that way There was this huge lawsuit about it to that Im pretty sure the family won The kicker? This happened in 2017 TWO YEARS since the ordinance was put in place The other Accidents? Last Year After finding that out the "DUIS" started sounding more like the city and officials trying to cover their asses This seems even more apparent since the "guard rail" was "completed" The guard rail they put there this past week doesnt cover the entire perimeter of the fountain; only on the side next to the highway And its not even on the shoulder of the highway Instead its on the slope as close as possible to the fountain Its also very short and rusted to hell There are few things this dinky ass rusted ass rail is gonna stop and not a single one of those things are motorized vehicles The slope itself is deep enough that anyone driving fast or that loses control could just bounce right over it while rolling down the slope Yet the city claims this is good enough That the rail is done Yeah a complete shitshow,crazycroc19,16424384990,3

hplf0vz,rm3qcl,My high school boys bathroom (there was only one) did not have a door nor were there doors on the toilet stalls For some reason lost to the sands of time all doors had been removed and it had been so many years nobody could remember why So when you were using the urinals your back was to the open doorway and literally the hallway and lockers you might as well be using a urinal in the hall The toilets were opposite the sinks and mirrors so anyone walking by in the hall had a clear view of the toilets in the mirrorbut thats a different story this story is about Steve Steve was a farm kid none too bright (and thats being kind) but he was a good kid The thing was Steve had the longest dick Ive ever seen in my life In gym class or basketball practice when wed change it was tradition to applaud when steves junk came out So one day Steve is taking a leak at the urinal and someone out in the hall starts joking at him about "Look how far away from the urinal Steve has to stand to keep his dick from getting wet" Steve responded by turning around and whipping an absolutely epic helicopter swing with his dongaround and around it went with dozens of people in the hall laughing hysterically Predictably administration did not appreciate the subtle humor and Steve was suspended and being considered for expulsion due to "sexually exposing himself" and his family threatened a lawsuit and contacted the local news media who did a whole story about "boy suspended for exposing himself while using urinal" and the whole thing got dropped and Steve was back in school after a few days All these years later I cant help but be a little horrified by how casually Steve performed this obviously well practiced dance of the dick and by the fact that the goddamn boys bathroom didnt have any fucking doors,McFeely_Smackup,16402022980,5
hpqo7ge,rm3qcl,None of the girls really thought it was funny but the guys did Boys at my school had what was called "The Folder" It was a folder of girls nudes as young as 13 that all the boys had No one spoke up about it really and the one girl that did was bullied They ganged up on her and threatened to spread her nudes around if she kept speaking about it Then a girl who had cancer shaved her head and posted that she was happy she was beating it The boys thought it would be funny to spread her nudes around everywhere calling her "cancer girl" They would randomly go up to people and ask them "do you want to see (enter random girls name)s nudes??" "Tits or ass?" A girl got her top pulled down and the boy never got in trouble Instead they told girls that we werent allowed to show our shoulders because they were "sexually provocative to male students and teachers who were looking at young girls every day" We also had KKK members at our school who would wear the white outfits and go around harassing minorities (We were on the news 3 times for racism and other schools shunned us because of how bad it was) Boys would openly talk about sex dungeons where they wished they could lock girls up and torture them and sexually assault them Because of all this happening the school had an assembly where they said "Sending nudes has consequences" Never once did they ever talk about how spreading nudes is child porn and you could get jail or juvie time for it All my school ever did was promote misogyny and racism The principals own son hit a girl in the parking lot where she fell and hit her head All the boys thought that hurting women was funny and guess what? They were ALL religious At the time a lot of us just brushed it off Most guys laughed and didnt care But now I wish I had spoke out and exposed all those motherfuckers They got lacrosse scholarships and went on religious mission trips while girls got life long trauma and shame The most empowering moment I ever felt was right when I graduated and matched with one of those misogynistic idiots on tinder and I screenshotted our conversation and posted on my story for 300 people to see Basically I said "I would never get with a piece of garbage who sent girls nudes around and terrorized women for laughs" I left his name and picture up I hope he thinks of that often and never does it again,y2kjanelle,16403005140,4
hpke15t,rm3qcl,Boys at my high-school would carve words into the walls of the bathroom stalls Pretty common type of graffiti seen the world over But the school decided to deal with it by permanently removing the doors to the bathroom stalls While I was there the procedure was to get a school newspaper a hold it in front of you to act as your door while you were on the toilet Everyone at the time just accepted it but what the FUCK was the school thinking?,Masterofice6,16401872680,2

The lady starts to help us out and the guy says "*Ive got it from here*" to her He then tells me that no one has notified him of this and that it is impossible Tells us that we have to go across town to JiffyLube get the oil changed and it would be covered under their business account with them I ask why I cant get a new car The nice lady said they had cars available and was very understanding He proceeds to tell me I dont know what Im talking about and that he is the manager and he knows his store in and out like the back of his hand I tell him I dont want to wait at JiffyLube for an hour He says we should have checked the oil life before we rented the car I tell him thats absurd its a rental Thats not my job He then tells me "You can go and get the oil changed or you can keep driving the car and Ill report this incident and if anything happens to the car you have to pay damages" I say "how is that possible or legal you rented me a car that needs maintainaince and are telling me I have to do it or pay for not my car" He said yes I literally said "Okay snowflake" then started walking away As I was walking away he said something I didnt catch We get to JiffyLube explain to the gentleman that it is a rental car and we are from Hertz The lube tech says "yeah (whatever the dudes name was at Hertz) called and said you guys would be here Ill get it done soon as I can" Then the lube tech proceeded to make a cup of coffee and eat for 15 minutes Took over an hour to do an oil change with no cars lined up before ours Then best of all HE CHARGED US FOR IT I said "the guy at Hertz said if we come here its free because they have an account with you guys" He said "they do but (the douche flute at Hertz) said there was an altercation therefore the company doesnt have to pay" I was like "what the hell I called him a snowflake and now I have to pay for an oil change on a rental car?" He says hes just doing his job I call Hertz Flagstaff Douche flute answered I say "so Im at JiffyLube and the guy informed me that I have to pay for the oil change due to an incident" He immediately says "you disrespected me youre lucky Im even talking to you now" I ask him "so because a customer said something that wasnt nice to you you are going to back out of a deal your company has with them? just to make me pay money out of my pocket FOR NOT MY CAR Is this so I learn a lesson?" He says "well you should learn something from this" I said "yeah never to rent from Hertz again And that you are an official snowflake I said something you got offended and make me suffer because of it Is this your first day in customer service? I deal with this for a living at my restaurant" He raised his voice and started to tell me how I have no respect and need to pay consequences for my actions I cut him off and said "Im not raising my voice why are you taking this personally" He hung up I went back inside and looked at the bill $85 for a Buick Encore oil change Its a fucking 2 liter engine I change all my oil on my own cars 85 is wack he used their "top teir" oil Better than what the car recommended Because "Thats the oil that Hertz tells us to use" So we ate our losses I paid the 85 since it was "my fault" We call Hertz 800 number and ask them for the lady that was helping us a few hours ago on the phone They connected us we explained to her what happened in detail I straight up told her "I called the dude a snowflake so we couldnt change cars and had to pay for the oil change" They told us they were sorry for the inconvenience and that they would mail us vouchers for that happening We go on the rest of our trip no more problems We return the car no problems We get 400 dollars in voucher coupons from Hertz corporate All is okay I guess We got the enough for a rental next trip SO WE FUCKING THOUGHT 2 weeks later we get a letter from Flagstaff Hertz saying that my mother (who rented the car) is banned for life from Hertz and their affiliates due to circumstances with our last rental BEST YET The letter states "All vouchers you recieved from corporate are now void" (because they had my moms name on them) Signed: douche flute himself FUCK HERTZ LIGMA BALLS,my-mind-is-my-enemy,16270838410,3

We actually have better plans for you Id be happy to upgrade you" Me: "Whats it going to cost?" Rep: "Oh youll notice a nice savings from your current plan should I go ahead and upgrade you?"

Rep 2: "I do understand sir(looks through my account) It appears that the reason is your phone plan doesnt include a texting bundle" Me: "Whats a texting bundle" Rep2: "Well your current plan doesnt include the ability to text but id be happy to add a bundle for you" Me: *sinking feeling in stomach and rage building* "How much is it to add a texting bundle?" Rep2 : "The most basic bundle will bring your total monthly to just over $65" Me: "I need you to put me back on my last plan The prepaid one I had before" Rep2: "Oh Im very sorry sir that plan is a legacy plan and no longer available " Me: "" Once I got my ass handed to me by my mom we got me off Verizon entirely and Ive never looked back Worse than the predatory sales practice was the burning shame of thinking Id done something good for myself and getting conned,suavez010,16270613410,2

Since they take on multiple "contracts/jobs" their clients indicated their targets so they dont have to abide by any morals or guilt nor do they have any intent since everything they do is strictly professional and the killer only needs to follow their own set of code of conduct to carry out the deed as long as they get the job done which usually results in monitory gains but may sometimes be for other benefits The fact that professional killers exist in this world and anyone (who is willing to spend the dosh) can hire for their services to bump someone else off just because of some personal vendetta or even as small as a misunderstanding can be truly terrifying,Revolee993,16233156580,2

"Child abuse cases skyrocket!" "Someone did another mass shooting in a shopping mall!"

"Homelessness is at an all time high!" "Look how this natural disaster fucked up this area!" "Rent is going up and the minimum wage still hasnt budged!" And of course: "Climate change will take us all out very soon but *what about the economy?*" Its like we are all working in a burning building and management is telling everyone to stay calm and keep working and half of the company is yelling "are you crazy? Put the fucking fire out youre gonna get us all killed!" And the other half is yelling "the fuck? We cant stop *everything* just to put the fire out do you know what that would do to our production schedule?!" And then management is saying "ughh if youre SO concerned with the "fire" then just keep a fire extinguisher on your person" And then youve got half the employees saying "I have a fire extinguisher and a big bucket of water but WE SHOULD REALLY PUT OUT THE FIRE" and then youve got the other half saying "you cant make me tote around a fire extinguisher all day!

h9lq3vk,p6qb47,I have two experiences with the supernatural 1- One night when i was 7 i just woke up at like 2 am This was weird because at the time i had a good sleeping scheduled I figured I just wanted some water so i went down my stairs I have an alarm system so nobody can get in my house or get out or else it would alert the local police I grabbed a cup and heard a noise in the front of the house It sounded like floor boards creaking which is weird because that only happens on the first board near the door So naturally being an oblivious 7 year old who has a thing for ghosts gets on all fours and crawls under the ping pong table from what i can remember it was a man who looked to be in his mid 20s and looked like he had gotten hit by a train I believe this was a ghost because of the temperature drop Naturally I was completely spooked and on the verge or crying so naturally I start praying ( I grew up in a religious home ) and he just kinda faded away That morning my parents are listening to the news Someone unfortunately ended their life on the train track near my house &#x200B; 2- At this time I was sleeping over at my grandparents house because my parents were on their anniversary or something My grandparents house was a originally a hospital in 1910 or something so everything is old and most likely haunted I forgot to pray that night Its also important to note that I developed pretty bad sleep paralysis at this time I woke up expecting not being able to move and for another night of hell (I didnt tell my parents what was going on so I had no idea what was happening) I was able to move so i thought everything was fine but when I sat up I saw something in the door way just staring at me He was bleeding from the mouth and was pretty thin Considering that the house was an old clinic that was built in 1910 he was probably a tuberculosis patient We made eye contact for like a solid 3 seconds and then he just kinda faded away I dont sleep over at my grandparents now &#x200B; Edit: I just asked my grandparents and it was built in 1902,sporks_are_poggers,16294197800,22
h9gm1tb,p6qb47,I used to ride a local city bus to my job a bunch of years ago The bus went over a well known local river to get to the western part of the city where my company was located On one day as we went over the bridge on the river I got a terrible feeling of danger and broke out into a cold sweat I had to use all my energy to stop myself from yelling to the bus driver " Stop someone is drowning" So the bus continued on and I calmed myself and went to work That evening at home I saw on the local news that someone was found drowned in the river about a quarter mile from where I had the terrifying feeling,spiritsarise,16293252560,21
h9tghzs,p6qb47,So when we were kids i was 7 yeras old we used to rent a home where my sister and I shared a room She is 4 years younger than me and she had this bad habit of waking up crying in the middle of the night One night we were sleeping and i woke up to see her standing beside my bed i said "oh look who just woke up and about to start crying" but when i look at her bed she was there sleeping Without thinking I cover my head with the bed sheets and go back to sleep Another incident happened in the summer when my cousins came to visit and we were all asleep in the living room and i woke up to find my sister standing in the middle of the room staring at us but also guess who was calmely sleeping next to our eldest cousinoh yeah my sister Anyway whenever i tell my mom about the incidents she brushs it off as my imagination Years later we bought our now home and when i was in high school like 17 or 16 years old mom and I were talking and we mentionned the old house and thats when she told me that it wasnt my imagination but she didnt want to scare me Mom story: Mom and dad are morning persons especially dad So she told me that one day she woke up around 6am and came to our room to check on us She found my sister in a very bad sleeping position so she straightened her position and cover her up with the sheets kisses her and heads to the living room to find dad watching early news and guess what my sister was asleep beside him on the couch She got scared and asks him what the hell my sister is doing in the living room He said " she woke up and she just came here" mom asks him for how long shes been with him and he said half an hour or so Thats when she freaks the hell out and rushs to our room to find no one in my sisters bed Of course she woke me up and took me to her bedroom to keep sleeping there Dad said he had one weird encounter when someone kept knocking on the bedroom door for 10 min when he was home alone one night (on that week we went to visit our aunt with mom) We lived in that house for 7 years and nothing really bad happened to us They were friendly No weird encounters happened in our now home,nova_novana,16295712530,20
h9zdhef,p6qb47,I had never heard anything prior to this moment Ever The night by Father passed away I was sitting at my computer and I kept hearing my name being called I ignored it but it would not go away It was a calm tone but it had a sense of urgency I had my headset up as far as it would go you could scream in my ear and even then I would have to know you were there to hear it But this voice wanted to be heard and there was no chance of me not acknowledging it Once I did I had the urge to check my phone Like I NEEDED to check it Like when you know you turned the stove off but what if My Fathers neighbors had been calling to let me know At this point there was no indication that my Dad might be dead We had a two hour phone conversation prior to receiving the news Still the only response I get to telling people this is "well your mind does things during grief" meanwhile I had no reason to be grieving when this happened I never believed in an afterlife prior to this but when I think of the bond I had with my Dad there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that he was coming to let me know before anyone else did,t_5594,16296834290,16
h9mdktp,p6qb47,I dreamt about an acquaintance the night she died I had known her for about 10 years but not very well at all She was young(40?) And had surgery for a very treatable cancer 2 months before I saw her a few days before she died and she seemed tired She said the doctor said she was fine and that she just had to keep up with regular activities to get her energy back She died in her sleep a few days after I last saw her In my dream I was congratulating her on being elected the next PTA president(which did happen the night before she died) In my dream I gave her a hug It was strange for me to dream about her because I did not know her that well When I got a call the next day that she had passed I was no shocked with the news Like my mind already knew It was very strange,unoeyedwillie,16294314200,15
h9f0ej8,p6qb47,Not "supernatural" and definitely explainable but At my last job I was a student loan consultant for a large lender In six years on the job I had a number of extremely unlikely coincidences happen to me Bear in mind that my job was national not regional so I would get customers calling in from all over the US: 1 I was assigned a loan where the borrower was the wife of a college friend She has a very unique name so when I saw it my first thought was that the coincidence was just in that this applicant shared a name with my friends wife which would have been pretty remarkable in itself Then I looked at the applicant info further and saw that she lived in the same small town that my friend lived in and I realized that it was her I had the loan reassigned before I even spoke to her 2 A lady I spoke to had the same last six digits of her SSN as my own Theoretically this would be a 1-in-1000000 chance if the digits of your Social Security number were purely random In reality there is a bit of patterning involved even after the area number (the first three digits) so its probably not really one-in-a-million but its still extremely unlikely 3 Same as above with a different customer but with the last five numbers matching my last five Again probably not purely a 1-in-100000 chance still pretty slim odds 4 I was transferred in a call from someone who was one of my friends friends that I had hung out with a few times His name was fairly common but all of the details about him lined up when I was given the file and I quickly found a reason to transfer him again before we got to talking about his account 5 I took an application from someone to cover some final costs just as her last semester was coming to an end and she happened to be graduating from my alma mater A week after I spoke to her a post of hers popped up in my Facebook newsfeed because she tagged one of my college friends in her graduation picture Now I talked to a *lot* of students and parents in this role so any one of these on their own was probably bound to happen eventually The SSN things arent even super unlikely given the number of Social Security numbers I had to deal with over my time there If I handled 10000 SSNs over the course of being employed (which probably isnt far from accurate) then the last-six-matching would have had a 0995% chance of happening once and the last-five-matching would have a 95% chance of happening once assuming pure randomness in the SSNs So neither of those were remarkably unlikely in the larger scheme of things but they were both highly unlikely on individual bases The other three scenarios though I dont even know how I could calculate the unlikeliness of being given two applicants that I knew personally and having another pop up in a completely unrelated context a week after speaking to her,film_composer,16292993900,15
ha3ev0d,p6qb47,One day me and my friend snuck out to talk since we only live a few houses away from one another We started out sitting in his backyard until we got a bad feeling and went to his front yard Since we were already on edge we kept our eyes and ears open Things were going fine until about 3 am I still remember checking my phone and it read 3:22 Thats when we noticed a woman set something down on my friends porch She turned to us and said something inaudible Both of us completely froze in a mix of shock and confusion This is where it gets weird First of all there was a street lamp in my friends front yard so both of us could very clearly see each others features Neither of us saw the womans face It was like a shadow was over her face Second we checked the porch figuring it was just someone on a newspaper routeat 3 am To our bewilderment there was no paper or anything on the porch Finally we checked the side of his house where we assumed the woman came from We saw no sign of her which was odd since there was only one road out of our neighborhood The other disturbing thing is that as soon as we walked to the side of his house a motion sensor light turned on The woman would have set the motion sensor light off both times she walked past it yet we never saw it turn on To this day my friend and I have no answers as to who or what the woman was Since then however we have both had many encounters with figures with horns apparitions and I have had very bad sleep paralysis,aanggang_137,16297605670,13

h9kg6il,p6qb47,So 2 things I will never be able to explain: On my 21st birthday I had learned my sister died of accidental overdose or suicide Actually 3 things I guess since initially that day I had no real plans for my birthday and usually ALWAYS had something going or planned out in advance People were hitting me up all morning asking me where/what we were going to do that night for my b-day and for some unexplainable reason I didnt respond to a single one Around 4:00 pm or so me and my roommate decided to toke up and so sadly I was pretty high when I got the news Looking back I would say it lessened the blow a bit to be honest It was like a terrible tragedy slowly unfolding because first I saw a Facebook picture my uncle posted captioned eerily "we love you Nicole (my sisters name)" I immediately called my sister 5-6 times with no response Called my mother 3 or so times no response And just as I was in the middle of calling my dad theres a knock at the door My mom barrels into my apartment sobbing uncontrollably with 2 of her friends and I dont remember rly what happened over the next 24 hrs except for we made the hr long drive home back from my college town to my moms house The next night is when shit got really weird I was still in complete state of shock basically and was having a tough time with nausea My girlfriend was laying in my bed already and I was lagging behind doing few things ae brushing teeth etc Looking back she was real pillar of strength for me during this time she was telling me a relatable story about someone elses family who had also suffered tremendous tragedy During this I had shut the lights off and jumped in the bed while both of our phones were in bathroom charging Suddenly about 2 minutes after I turned the lights off and we were laying in complete silence a large-blue orb rose slowly from the middle of the room at the foot of our bed and exploded into a million shards of blue what we both could only describe as a massive lighting strike in middle of room with no noise Im pretty sure I said "what the hell is that" and she said "oh my god" simultaneously as it was happening but afterwards the expression on our faces was completely utterly flabbergasted and we felt the chills/goosebumps on eachothers bodies We double checked again to make sure it wasnt a camera flash or something but as I said both phones were in next room and no TV in room at the time I did a little bit of googling on blue orbs after death after this and actually found some very spooky similar articles The second thing is the very next day while driving to her viewing I had just pulled onto the highway when suddenly a car cuts me off and pulls directly in front of me with a huge bumper sticker right in the middle of the back windshield of "the eye of rah" Seems pretty insignificant until you realize its the only tattoo my sister had and not once in my life have I ever seen another car before or since with a bumper sticker like that It drove me all the way to the funeral home I was so shocked I remember vividly snapping 2-3 quick pictures of it on my phone so I could show my mom and dad Unfortunately when I go to get out my phone there are no pictures to be had I have since gotten the same tattoo in same spot After both of these experiences I came to the conclusion that she was proving to me she was okay and that there IS life after death,muhradee1,16293999880,8

I was watching that!" And the tv flipped right back to MTV #4 I loved my grandma very much still do She fought cancer for 7 years I had made plans with her to go over with my SO on a Friday and cook her dinner On Wednesday I am walking out from work on my lunch break headed to my car and I stop for no reason thinking to myself "shes not going to be here on Friday" I got a little annoyed with myself as I didnt like thinking of the inevitability of her passing and went about my day Friday I get a call that she is in a diabetic coma unresponsive and going to the hospital I meet my family there and the doctors manage to pull her out of the coma but shes incoherent just making pained sounds and squirming in bed We decide that we should take her back home She never said another word From Friday on she went comatose and began actively dying She passed some time after I finally left her side Sunday morning Edit: #5! I was at home on the weekend of a perfectly normal day and my phone starts ringing I go to pick it up and see its my best friend whom I talk to pretty regularly but as I pick up the phone to answer I stop and say "her dad died" Immediately I feel like a fucked up person for even thinking it as her dad is in good health and not very old and theres absolutely no reason for me to have that thought As it turned out he had actually passed away In the middle of the night hed had a heart attack in his sleep My friends now joke that they want me to tell them if I ever have a feeling that theyre going to die I had the same feelings about two pets and my Grandma (mentioned above) and havent been wrong once,dasistverboten,16293485220,6

h9i5k3u,p6qb47,Second comment because as I read some stories here I recalled one very more interesting Had a friend when I was a young teenager we were pretty good friend We lost contact growing up When we were in our 30ish years old I got news from friends we know each other that he had brain tumor and pronostic was a year or so I was devastated I knew he just got married got university degree in Australia and just came back to Montreal to settle with his wife I was also scared to see him because I didnt know how I would deal with this didnt want to make thing worst because death scare me alot and I am very emotional person So I kept postponing the moment I would go see him until one night in a dream I was in a caf I could not recognize My friend enter the cafe looking wonderful and peaceful sit next to me and tell me those words very clearly (in French): Vincent if you want to see me now is the moment as I am leaving soon The next day I got a call from a close friend of ours that told me he was getting in transition home (not sure the French expression for this a place where you usually go for your last days) Thats the end of the supernatural thing but I would like to add that when I got there before entering the room I told the doctor I was nervous He asked why and I told him I didnt know how to deal with death To what the doctor replied:  do not worry Dominic know how and hes ready for it  It somehow gave me the guts to get in my friend was sitting there his wife by his side looking like a 80 old man bald shaking he then proceed to tell me about his life what hes done what he would have like to do At some point I started crying like a baby and he said:  be strong Vincent  What a humbling moment,Guignol1981,16293549200,6

h9j5vgd,p6qb47,When I was around 7 my mom died in cancer I didnt know about it until my aunt invited me upstairs where she grandma and my cousins waited for me to tell the bad news (we lived in my aunts house with my grandma while mom was in hospital) After the consolation and crying I went to go downstairs to be alone in my room and process the stuff Guess what Mom literally stood in front of me waving and going down the stairs I literally stopped and then went down as nothing happened When I came downstairs I saw her again on the corridor going into the kitchen as I stopped and watched it again I went to the kitchen and found no one there The scary part about this is that I didnt even realized wtf just happened and went on with my things as normal I saw her in my dreams once and also when I played lego on the couch She sat next to me and again didnt even realize what happened and started to cry after I couldnt see her My aunt told me that little kids often imagine things but this was different I could feel her presence see her,Consistent-Ad-6956,16293806740,5

h9gkq1d,p6qb47,When I was 6 I had a dream where I got mad at our dachshund and threw her down the stairs She bounced against the door at the bottom and her head exploded It was a pretty traumatic dream for a 6 year old but I didnt say a word to anyone in my family and just gave my dog extra pets and treats for the next few days to make up for dream mes actions A week later she was hit by a car The tire of the car ran over her head and from my older brothers retelling of the story her head exploded I spent years carrying the guilt that my premonition killed my dog A few years later my second dog was hit by a car and died while I was at swim practice I remember climbing out of the water and crying on the side of the pool I refused to swim and knew something was wrong When I got home my mom tried to tell me the news but I told her I already knew Three years or so later I was sitting on the stairs petting my new dog and started screaming for my mom to come and help I told her my pet hamster had just died but I was too scared to go check on her Sure enough my mom reached in to her cage and pulled my warm recently deceased hamster out of her cage My junior year of college I had a very old blind betta fish that I thoroughly loved I dreamt one night that I was swimming in a lake and he swam up to me booped me on the nose and swam away as healthy and whole as he had been the day I got him I woke up crying and called my mom to let her know that my fish had died but I couldnt bring myself to check until after my interview that morning When I got back to my apartment he had lost all color and was floating at the top of his tank I felt the moment my first hedgehog took her last breath within my own chest as I was driving her to the vet several years ago Since then I have been with my 2 dogs as they have been put down due to organ failure from old age The first came to visit me the first night after she passed I was visiting a farm and out of nowhere she trotted up to me and demanded that I sit down and pet her just as she had throughout her life The second came a month or so after she passed I dreamt that I was walking up to a house with a big wrap around front porch My grandfather that passed my freshman year of college was sitting in a rocking chair on the porch with my dog sitting in his lap petting her head and smiling at me I told my mom about it the next day and she told me my grandfather had frequently told her how much he liked my dog It was not something I had ever heard but it was a great comfort My most recent hedgehog was also euthanized; I felt this tension release in my chest the moment she passed and a sweeping sense of peace She had been fighting cancer and was dealing with a great deal of pain in her last day I know I was feeling the moment her pain ended I am very grateful that the premonitions did not remain as terrifying as the first but rather offered a sense of relief and comfort with my most recent losses I do have some friends that joke that they dont want me near their animals just in case I am the cause of their death but I think that is highly unlikely as most of my animals have had exceptionally long lives besides the two dogs lost to car accidents,AlyandGus,16293246420,4
h9gn4ti,p6qb47,I have so many of these its difficult to choose which to share Ill narrow it down to two First one I was about 18 when I had my last visit with my grandmother in the hospital She had dementia and was disoriented didnt really realize me and my family were there and wasnt making much sense Then she turned to me and looked in my eyes with what was clearly recognition and said "9 oclock its going to happen at 9 oclock" She immediately resumed her babbling and nobody except me and my sister noticed she had said anything We mentioned it to my parents immediately after we left but they wrote it off as her dementia The next day we got a call from the hospital that she had passed away Time of death was exactly 9:00am Second one not me but my mom In her 20s she basically decided to leave her whole life behind pack her bags and move to Taiwan When she got to the airport she needed help navigating and found a man who spoke English who was incredibly helpful He told her he would walk with her and help her find her way and he just needed to stop in a store real quick and to wait outside While she was waiting outside an older man walked up to her and said simply "do not trust that man" She thought it was odd and tried to follow the guy to ask questions but after he rounded a corner he had disappeared She immediately grabbed her bag and walked away from the store A few weeks later she saw in the newspaper a picture of the man who had tried to help her at the airport it turned out he had been arrested for kidnapping tourist women under the pretense of helping them and she had likely narrowly avoided being one of his victims She definitely believed in guardian angels after that,jabernathy95,16293257590,5
h9guv6x,p6qb47,Guy was my best friend basically since kindergarten we were born a month and 3 days apart (me in August him in September) During high school he had gotten really bad into alcohol and hard liquors drugs and marijuana He and some of his friends (for whom I mostly just felt sorry for) would get drunk/high/whatever in the ag shop at school and never got in trouble for it Less than a year after we had graduated there was a guy from our school that got killed in a drunk driving accident Dude got shitfaced and wrapped himself around a tree So naturally the drinkers got together and had a party in his name The week before the party (party was on a Saturday night) I kept having this awful dream that my friend got killed in a drunk driving accident and gotten ejected from the vehicle through the front windshield I would wake up screaming multiple times during the night with the same dream over and over I spent the rest of the week begging and pleading with him not to go to the party I did everything I could think of to keep him from going Trying to keep myself from falling apart about a dream I went out on Saturday evening with some other friends to watch a movie Everything was fine and we enjoyed the movie But I got back home and my parents were sitting on the couch waiting for me with a phone in their hand and they had obviously been crying I asked what was wrong and they gave me the heartbreaking news: My friend despite all my begging and pleading had gone to the party He was in a vehicle with 3 or 4 of his other friends and they were all drunk Hit a tree and he was ejected through the front windshield and declared dead on scene by police and paramedics Ive never had anything like this happen again Foresight? Predicting the future? Just a bad dream? You decide All I know is that I did everything I could to protect my friend and it was all for nothing I know I shouldnt blame myself for what happene but I still do and I wonder if there was anything more that I could have done to prevent it from happening (or even getting to that point of addiction in the first place) I still have that same nightmare sometimes I really miss my friend Please dont drink and drive guys The risk just is not worth it,LordSt4rki113r,16293293600,3

h9hep06,p6qb47,Ok this started ever since I was 12 We went on a school field trip to a newspaper manufacturing company and we all got out of the bus and approached the building entered the lobby and then this strong smell hits me so hard I couldnt take a step further in I told my teacher about it but no one else could smell it As a result she allowed me to stay in the lobby and wait for the rest of the kids to tour the facility We get back in the bus school is done we go home and Im still smelling this strong smell (I call it the newspaper smell) Next day I found out my best friends (at the time) mom passed away from lung cancer I was sad about it but then went about my normal life A few days later the smell went away and all was fine until 3 years later Im chilling doing my normal activities and then that same smell hits me hard I told my mom and sis about it but no one could smell it Next day moms uncles passed away Few days later the smell goes away That same smell hit me again when another relative passed away a few years later My sister said maybe I get that smell when someone I know passes away I was like "no way" wtf? But I figured let me track this And I realized holy moly the closer the person that passes away is to me the stronger the smell so over the years Ive had this smell come and go on varying degrees and it has always resulted in someone I know passing away Im still in denial but kind of believing the link of this pattern Fast forward all the way till I was 25 or so I was studying for an exam in college and then this smell hits me it freaks me out everytime it does but I push through and try to study next day (still vaguely smelling it) I get a text message from a random person saying exactly this: "Thank you for your assistance with the burial of my son" Duuuuuude Ah Still freaks me out just remembering that I sent the person a reply saying "Im sorry for your loss but you have the wrong number" That was it I still get those smells and it freaks me out everytime,Kawrpa,16293387390,4
h9i4qog,p6qb47,After reading a few I realized Ive also had the weird dream things So I was about 12 years old I had had a weird experience so I was afraid and I forced my parents to let me sleep in their room In the middle of the night I get up and instantly turn the TV on I dont remember why I did this I never watched TV at that age I dont think Ive ever watched TV lol Maybe I wanted to make myself tired again to go back to bed So the TV is on the News channel Theres a news about a plane crash and all the passengers are sadly dead Im just passively watching it The noise and light wakes my mom she asks me what Im doing I tell her casually "theres a plane crash" She tells me to just go to sleep and I guess I did Next day my dad gets a call from my aunt Her husband was in that plane crash and hes passed away I never thought it was anything weird I just thought coincident like I turn the TV on and see the news - it could have been anything It just happened to be that news It was just so weird though My mom also remembered me telling her about that news she was more freaked out than I was,FletchTheBitch,16293542760,3

h9gk0qn,p6qb47,Little backstory for this one Sorry if its long After college I lived with my mom for a little while I had two younger brothers that also lived with her My girlfriend would stay with me for extended periods of time too I lived in the upstairs room that was rather large the nicest room in the house other than my moms right This room also had a door in the closet that led to the walk-in attic So naturally when I moved out my brother switched bedrooms to get the nicer room My girlfriend on several occasions in the middle of the night would wake me up in a total panic We would keep the blackout curtains shut so the only light in the room would be the little glow of the alarm clock She described a very tall man that she could barely see standing over the bed staring at her I would calm her down and get her back to bed I never wanted to scare her so I never told her that I have also seen the same thing years before I went to college Well when we moved out she would mention it a few times like it was a relief we werent there anymore I broke the news that Ive been seeing that since I was a kid It totally ruined the my moms house for her We never told ANYONE so we didnt freak out the rest of my family that lives there The cherry on top is that a year later my brothers girlfriend was telling us that she keeps seeing a dark figure staring at her in the middle of the night and she cant bear to sleep there (in that same room) anymore My girlfriend and I look at each other with pure terror in our eyes We told her we kept seeing the same thing The sprinkles on the Sunday come now My mom ended up leasing the home to another family after she moved out I help her on the weekends here and there So one day I show up to the house to help the tenants with an issue theyre having with the cooling unit in the attic When I get upstairs I see the 7 year old boy moving things out of his room (the same room) I ask him whats going on? His mother says shes not sure hes having nightmares and says he keeps seeing a ghost Needless to say I wasnt very keen on fixing the issue with the cooling unit for an hour in the attic after that It still gives me the chills when I think about it,Far-Step-3285,16293243140,2
h9gt392,p6qb47,This happened when I was very young maybe 4 years old My family lived in Manhattan at the time in an apartment building on a fairly high floor My parents had gone out to dinner and left me with a sitter who had sent me to bed early I remember this because I was mad about it and as soon as she left my room I sat up in bed on my knees and leaned on the windowsill looking out at the city thinking something like "You cant tell me what to do" A small gray ball not sure of the size because I was small then maybe 6-ish inches in diameter was floating at a slow but steady pace outside my window It had no distinguishing marks or attributes other than a weirdly consistent pace that clearly indicated it hadnt somehow been thrown (I was well over ten stories up so that would have been very unlikely anyway) I ran and got my sitter but of course when we got back to my room it was gone The next day I grabbed my father first thing and told him to put an ad in the newspaper (I didnt know how newspapers worked and thought it was all ads people placed) that I had seen a UFO In hindsight Im guessing I thought that because Marvin the Martians flying saucer was sort of similar though fancier and contained a Martian Anyway- this was decades before drones and I have no explanation and Ive never heard anything similar,craftydistraction,16293285180,2

h9gy05k,p6qb47,Here are a few: First: This happened to me a few times I would "wake up" one morning everything looks normal I open my room door and Im in some long hallway I do not recognize When I try going out one of the doors it takes me outside to some place that looks super familiar but still to this day couldnt figure out where Ive seen it (I still vividly remember the details) This happened twice in this particular home Fast-forward to about 10 years later I moved to a different home Same thing I wake up room looks normal open the door same long hallway But this time I decide to look out my window I see the same thing as I saw in the home before And when I tried talking it comes out muffled Second: when I was four I hated going to sleep I once remember going to bed I just sit there for what feels like 5 minutes I get up look outside and it looks like its an hour before dawn I do not recall sleeping at all Third: Everytime my paternal grandmothers ear "pops" once it means bad news is coming When it keeps pops repeatedly good news is coming The bad news one scares me the most It can be anything from a flat tire to a death in the family Every time she tells me it popped I get so nervous One evening she said she felt the most intense pop shes ever felt and reiterated that something major would happen My grandfather (her husband of over 70 years) died the next morning (which we all kind of expected considering he was almost 101 and terminal) It got to the point to where every time my ear popped I get nervous (though nothing happens when I experience it) Fourth: a few times I "woke up" in my basement TV was on but couldnt tell what was on Every step I took I heard a loud noise (kind of like a giant walking) I would walk big steps but never seemed to get close to the stairs Each time I talked it seemed like my words were "slowed down" (kind of like talking at 025x) and would echo Then there were neon lights and smoke (smoke you would see at a club) I would wake up after that Fifth: sometimes I would have a weird dream that something "important" or "serious" is happening but my vision is always super blurry so I couldnt see it No matter what I do I only see a blur,theterptroll,16293308720,2

gz9il13,njrvgm,This was back in January She was a tenant at my house and we stayed decent friends But this was above and beyond anything I had experienced with her Lets call her Britt She read some Tarot cards that said this was the season of moving She informed me of this and I said "Okay so are you going to move?" She said "Im not sure I definitely want to move before Mercury goes into retrograde and I want to do it soon" So she gives notice to move out in April fine Then she gives notice for March Then she asks if she can leave next week? You know what fine whatever Sure move next week Ill help you GTFO Then she changes her mind and wants to move in April then March I told her to MAKE UP HER MIND She finally decides she wants to leave in two weeks Okay fine let me help you move out She then decides that "moving" means "vacation" and that she wants to go to Hawaii to relax on the beach I tried to tell her that there were plenty of beaches where we lived (west coast USA) and she could relax there NOPE She wants to be on a beach in Hawaii Now a few things to keep in mind - she is a broke single mom that is completely irresponsible with her money Shell blow money on a whim and never has anything saved Its a poverty mindset "Why save when theres always an emergency? Ill just deal with it when it happens" Now theres nothing wrong with broke single women I get it Being a single parent is hard But its that she decides to dump her kid off with her ex take the stimmy check and use that money to book a plane ticket to Hawaii and say "yo Ill be back in six months Landlord can you hold my place for me at the house? I dont want to pay rent during this time but can you hold it until I get back?" I told her no She gave notice I already posted an ad Shes leaving In other conversations I had with her she expresses that "she misses the freedom of not being a parent" and "wishes she could take back being a mom" She then informed her child that she would be gone for "up to 6 months but wasnt sure when she would be back" Her child was understandably devastated but took the news best he could During the last few days at the house I went over to do some normal maintenance housework While there her son was in my way "MOVE God youre always in the way!" she shouted at him "Sorry" her child said sheepishly He moved and I continued about my work but he was in my way again as I continued to work "HEY YO YOU GOTTA GET OUT OF HIS WAY God youre SO SLOW at everything! Jesus would you move?" He didnt reply and sulked off to his bedroom I was thinking "If shes like this when Im around what is she like when Im not around?!" After moving out completely her son went off to his fathers place while she booked it for Hawaii When she reached Hawaii she texted me that "she was sorry for being so hasty in coming out but hoped we could remain friends" I told her to fuck off and never contact me again I assumed things were over NOPE Within two weeks I got a request from two different landlords asking me for a rental reference for her! Like is she INSANE?!

gzep9z7,njrvgm,There were plenty of things that piled up over 5-6 years that should have noped me right out sooner but I was a 15-year-old girl during a time when Twilight was big who got all googly-eyed when he told me he loved me and wanted to spend his life with me I was lonely nave and easily manipulated and he knew it Nope flags like: * He was 11 years my senior Meaning I was 15 he was 26 * The very next night after the "relationship" was official in our minds he wanted to fondle me * Claimed to be Christian but had no problem sneaking into my bedroom at night to ask for a blow job on countless occasions * Tried to pretend our "relationship" wasnt all about the physical stuff (which he asked for/forced every chance he got and his pleasure was always the focus not mine) He was very good at placating me with flowery words and lies about our blissful future together * The fact that he demanded our relationship be kept secret He forbade me from texting him when other people were in the room because he was afraid they might look over my shoulder and get wise to what was happening (AKA call him out for being a child molester and throw his ass in jail) We even created fake emails with fake names for instant messaging * When our "relationship" went long distance there were very few Skype sessions that didnt end with me pulling off my shirt so he could jerk off and then fall asleep * He was wishy-washy as shit constantly breaking things off with me because he had an attack of the conscience But then like clockwork not even a week would go by and hed beg for me (aka my body) back And like a nave little idiot I fell for it every time One night while video chatting with him in my college dorm room after about 6 years of this he pressured me to take my top off (like usual) and I refused (very unusual) He threw a temper tantrum a 2-year-old would be proud of That for whatever reason was the beginning of the rift that finally caused me to cut him loose which I had never done before I finally took off my nave glasses and saw him for what he was: a lonely old pathetic loser of a man who could do no better in the relationship realm than take advantage of an inexperienced girl This guy screwed me up Almost ten years later and Im still working through this shit Ive placed an excessive amount of emphasis on my physical appearance in subsequent relationships thinking very toxically that if I am no longer attractive to this person they will leave me If I reject enough sexual advances they will leave me He taught me that my worth was mostly in my body and how I used it If I am not the perfect little submissive sextoy girlfriend I will be disposed of like trash The good news is I *am* successfully working through all my garbage and have an amazing relationship with the love of my life my husband of almost four years now Through many painful conversations he has helped me understand that attraction is complex and multifaceted that yes my body is part of the equation but there are plenty of other more important things that he prioritizes for a mate and the future mother of our children I have been pathologically terrified by the appearance of little wrinkles at the corners of my eyes I have been terrified of getting old and having my body become less and less attractive (therefore decreasing my overall worth as a human female) I now know this fear is irrational When my husband says he wants to grow old with me he has no delusions that my 26-yo body will last until I die This body that contains "me" is only a small piece of my existence that he loves There is plenty of intangible stuff that is much more important in the long-term I dont know where the molester is nor what his life situation is and I couldnt give the slightest flippity flip Its taken a long time for me to be free of him I hope when he stands before Old Testament God on judgment day that he falls on his knees in futility because he will receive no mercy If youve read this far thanks for that I encourage everyone to find someone they trust to talk through traumas Journaling helps too Be kind to yourself as you work through stuff Peace and love to you all <3,writeliftrepeat,16219603110,6

Her dog btw was going absolutely apeshit during this entire interaction I never saw that dog act like that before or after this happened Now remember: Id gotten a few tickets on that same stretch of road within that same year or two I was very familiar with this process and knew how long it should take and what to expect In my previous experience most cops go back to their cruisers for a good 6-8minutes This guy came back after about 2 minutes Kinda tossed my license and registration into my friends lap like he was annoyed and yelled at me to slow down and told me hed just give me a verbal warning for now I thanked him despite how creepy it was and while I was putting my license back in my wallet and registration back in my glove compartment he fired up his cruiser and floored it back onto the highway This is also NOT normal Any time Id been pulled over they would always tell me to pull out ahead of them so they could make sure I merged carefully back onto the freeway My friend and I were freaked She was more freaked than me I think I was trying to explain it away give him the benefit of the doubt at first But the longer I thought about it the more uncomfortable I became I couldnt shake that nasty feeling that something wasnt quite right Fast forward many years later I remember hearing about some cop that had been arrested Hed been trolling I-5 N in Northern California (during that same time period Id been on road trips) stopping unsuspecting young single female motorists and sexually assaulting them in his cruiser His MO was to pull up alongside their cars scan them to make sure they were single females and pull them over in desolate areas at early morning hours He ended up murdering one of these girls when she put up too much of a fight I cant remember his name and I dont know what he looked like it was too dark to see his face well But my blood turned cold when Id heard that Definitely dodged a huge nuclear life-changing (possibly life-ending) event thanks to my tired friend and her protective little dog EDIT: I did not expect my inbox to explode over this! I am doing my best to reply to the comments but maybe an umbrella edit is easier: Many of you are saying that you know this case from Forensic Files the case I believe youre referring to is from the 80s and happened in San Diego So this was an entirely different cop that I encountered As I stated above I didnt see the guys face He wasnt close enough to the side of my car thanks to my friends dog (not only that I got the impression he was trying to make sure his face remained out of view) I have done some light googling today to see if I can pin point this situation better and find an actual news article to point to and say "its probably this guy!" But I havent been able to find any such thing (yet) Part of the problem might be because I got the year wrong I said 2004 because to the best of my estimation thats when I believe this happened That being said its possible that it happened as early as late 2002/early 2003 or as late as 2007/2008 I made so many trips to and from CA <-> WA and that friend of mine joined me a 2-3 of those times so Im not 100% sure what year this took place Another problem? I also dont know exactly where either I say I-5 N in Northern CA its a big long state There are a few good long desolate stretches along that highway that are pitch black at night for miles They always blurred together for me before especially at night But if I had to guess? This happened somewhere in the abyss before or after Redding CA Scary thing I have discovered today: there are a sickening amount of stories just like this in the news old and new Last: thank you for all of these awards completely unexpected and super appreciated I seldom open Reddit up in the morning and I dont think Ive ever even commented on a Reddit post before 8pm Today when I saw that question this memory from that road trip flooded me and I just shared it with exactly zero expectations for any response let alone this Stay safe out there! PRO TIP (thanks to those commenting): If you ever find yourself alone on the highway getting pulled over by the police and you feel in any way shape or form uncomfortable pulling to the shoulder slow your car down turn on your hazards and call 911 (if you have no service just keep driving until you do) Inform them of your predicament they will relay this to the cop behind you who will gladly follow you to the safe place of your choosing to make a stop Moreover a 911 dispatcher will also be able to warn you that theres no cop in that location which means you should keep driving and wait for the real police to arrive,Wander_Pig,16348330420,16520

hhirjdv,qcqv9v,I was in Kampala Uganda in 2010 working for a UN agency I was watching the World Cup Finals but our internet/TV was spotty and went out so I decided to walk down the road to the Kyadondo Rugby Club where they were hosting a screening I got dressed and was heading out the door when my roommate told me the internet was back on I said I wanted to go down and watch with the crowd either way My roommate shrugged but offered to share his Waragi (think Ugandan Gin) if I stayed and hung out I agreed saying I was feeling kinda lazy anyway At the 90th minute two bombs went off at the Rugby Club killing 64 people Al-Shabaab later claimed responsibility We heard the explosions but took it for thunder until news items started popping up Not technically a nuke but two bombs dodged through sheer laziness,Imdippyfresh,16348405670,88
hhi0umi,qcqv9v,Guy on Grindr Iwas chatting with looked cute and we were chatting He was too far though and I was a student who didnt have a car / could not host in dorms He was later arrested for purposely spreading HIV through grindr hookups This was in Edinburgh Edit: for the record this was before PrEP was available in Scotland and I dont think its even relevant I never even stated my safe-sex practices I actually was on PrEP though but that doesnt change the fact that I dodged a bullet by not having sex with someone malicious enough to purposely spread HIV Some of you are quick to jump on the victim blaming band-wagon The guy made national news and apparently also blackmailed men he slept him [https://wwwbbccom/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-44003613](https://wwwbbccom/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-44003613) My dodged bullet is less about HIV and more so that I did not encounter (and have sex with) someone with very malicious intent Theres a lot of you in the comments making assumptions about my sexual practices when I never even mentioned them,penislobsterpie,16348298220,12390

hhhvmf1,qcqv9v,Its a story Ive recounted multiple times in my life TLDR at the bottom \[**Context\]**: *Im a 40 year old Gay man and this story takes place when I was about 22 years old* This might date me here but I was browsing [CraigslistCom](https://CraigslistCom) s personal adds I was quite adventurous at that time and I didnt have a boyfriend back then So I often looked for NSA hook-ups I found a profile for a man only 3 years older than me (*well call* **Brad**) looking for NSA "passionate hugging" He was cute and if his dating profile was anything to go off of wed hit it off nicely Since I couldnt host we agreed to meet at a neutral location in my citys downtown area When I got there I saw him talking with a group of 5 other guys in our age-bracket or so I initially assumed they were his friends Well it *was* true to an extent &#x200B; Curious I asked who the other men were He explained they were with him to also hook up and the nights activities would involve a group I thought in that moment "Okaynot *totally* against this" I signal that while caught off guard I would go along with them We start walking in the opposite direction of where hed said his car was parked We are now walking through the far seedier section of our downtowns "LGBT" district This place wouldve been sketchy to anyone - let alone to gay men I asked what we were doing and he said he was going to take a little bit to score some coke meth and heroin! He wanted to make it an unforgettable night To quite a Youtuber "This was a Cold-War Era Soviet Propaganda Parade of Red-Flags" I might have been only just comfortable with the group thing but drugs? Hell no &#x200B; I said that I wasnt going to go through with it and despite how much it would cost Id be taking a cab home (*Uber didnt exist yet*) He grew dark and grabbed me by the shirt He said I wasnt going anywhere He said that because we met and there was evidence of our conversation that might be enough to get me brought up on charges should they get caught I gulped as this going so far south people could charter expeditions to find it &#x200B; Before much else could happen over his shoulder I saw a familiar face get out of a car It was someone Id fooled around with before I saw my ticket out of there I called to the man (*Lets call him* **Ted***)* I called out to Ted and said "Hey honey youre here early I wasnt expecting you for another couple of hours" Ted first looked very bewildered but once we made eye-contact he remembered who I was and seemed to read I was in trouble "(He sighs) Ugh I know and I wouldve been able to give you more time but the clients car broke down on the 5 or something So boss sent me home early Didnt you say you had a date with somebody? Is this him?" Brad stammered but just nodded that he was "the guy" I had intended to meet Ted walked forward and hugged me "Are you going to have fun?" Ted asked I replied "Yeah but can we stop by the house I want to pick up a few things This partys going to be *wild!*" He agreed and took me by the hand and lead me back to his condo nearby \[**The Aftermath**\] &#x200B; The next afternoon my local News Station reported that very same group of men were busted for major drug violations Everyone got arrested not just the ring leader They took everybody in while they sorted out who had actually committed a crime So Id indeed avoided a Czar Bomba to the face! &#x200B; **TLDR:** While browsing [Craigslistcom](https://Craigslistcom) for NSA Passionate Hugging I found a match I went to meet him only to find him with 5 other guys Then he tells me hes off to score some pretty hard drugs and tries to blackmail me into joining in I see a random guy Id hooked up with before that pulled me out of the fire and took me home safe and sound If anybody is curious: >!Yes I did give my savior a good romp for his heroic deed!<,Damionstjames,16348276010,1606
hhiemuy,qcqv9v,When I was 20 I was driving a taxi cab It wasnt much of a money but I was pretty desperate I remember one time I had to pick up a guy from the airport I arrived and saw him literally counting a huge bunch of cash There was like 5k euros minimum He sat in we had a casual conversation Then he asked me about the money as a cab driver I told him its shit He offered me to go to Ireland and work "variety of available jobs that pay 4k a month minimum" When I told him Id think about it he still tried to persuade me talking about the money invited me to a sports bar etc I still refused He gave me his number just in case and then walked away at his destination After 2 weeks I read on the news about how police busted a group of human traffickers that employ people to work at the Ireland and then make them their human slaves to work with drug distribution making people live in the cages and using some as sex dolls From photos of the article I saw that the head of the group was the same guy I gave a ride I literally almost fainted,Audoryosa,16348353780,41

hhj8p50,qcqv9v,I was 19 and met a guy on tinder I had a weird vibe from him but couldnt put my finger on it He was nice we had the same interests and same taste in music so we talked for a bit After like a week or two of just texting he asks me to go on a date and Im like yeah sure why not? I wasnt really feeling this guy but I hadnt met him in person yet so I figured its only fair to give him a chance irl Some people have weird vibes over text but when you meet them they might be really cool When planning the date he kept suggesting things like a hike or going over to his house for dinner I wasnt comfortable with that because I dont know him and no matter how old I am- I never ever go somewhere alone with someone I dont know I suggested going out to dinner (in public) and he reluctantly agreed I didnt like him He was nice and all but there was something about him that I cant describe that made me feel anxious and uneasy After the date he wanted me to come back to his place I said no thank you so he walked me to my car He asked again I said no thank you again Later that night he asked if we can do a second date and I declined I wasnt feeling him and something about him just made me feel *wrong* Like I cant explain it Anyway about a week or two later (I dont remember how much time passed honestly) he was in the local news for violently raping and assaulting a woman he met on the internet,rusty___shacklef0rd,16348474990,16
hhifcg0,qcqv9v,Back in 2019 went on a vacation to Spain We were going to Barcelona and Madrid Debated for a little bit the order but sort of just randomly (but there may have been a better air travel deal) to got to Barcelona first and then take the train over to Madrid and then fly home Cut to the actual vacation and everything runs smoothly We stayed in a hotel in Barcelona and we did flip through the local channels (and the BBC) while there at night However in Madrid we were staying at an Air BnB and the TV was located in a awkward location so we never turned it on Cut to going home we get picked up by my brother at the airport and he mentions that there were riots in Spain while we were there We had no idea Turns out: the riots broke out in Barcelona the day after we left the city and were occurring the whole time we were in Madrid It shut down all the major tourist spots and disrupted travel at the airport There were cars burning on Las Ramblas a major thoroughfare and where our hotel was located If we had gone to Madrid first and Barcelona second: we would have been in the thick of Catalan unrest wouldve probably been stuck inside our hotel room the whole time and possibly wouldve had difficulty returning home PSA: always check the news of a place you are about to visit We would have known ahead of time that some Catalan politicians were about to be sentenced (it had been planned for a while) and possibly cause an uprising,quagmirejoe,16348356570,7

hhjuutg,qcqv9v,Years ago I was in top level government job and wanted to leave I was informed that a lobbyist wanted to open a branch of his firm in the capital and was looking for someone with exactly my profile to be head of the branch I met with him and got uncomfortable really fucking fast The man had no idea what he was talking about setting expectations that were not plausible in the slightest In my experience people in that line of work that have that much of a disconnect with reality tend to be  fixers  instead of legitimate lobbyist as in instead of putting the work in to convince the government of their objectives they do illegal things to buy their way in I politely declined the job offer A year or two later I had become head of a powerful business network/lobbying institution A few weeks after my hiring had been announced in the newspapers I was contacted again by that man He also had changed jobs and was now head of some sort of business school for high ranking public officials in local administrations that was funded near entirely by his political contacts (school that coincidentally had the same initials as him) He wanted desperately to sign a contract with us for cooperation I got what three to five messages a week on his part for two months ? I said no politely at first but quite firmly the more he insisted There was just something that felt off with his insistence especially considering his local political contacts already managed to bully my members in the place he had his school set up in into signing a contract with him a contract that they (wisely) managed to prevent from having any legal value whatsoever The contract he was proposing had no added value be it for my workplace or his except the ability to make a press release about it Note by the way that a lot of my members actually provided the same services as he did so we would basically be helping a concurrent Understanding that my door was closed he called the chair of my board and tried to convince her using the same tactics When she told me I advised her to redirect any new inquiries from him to me and refuse to talk with him Thats when I got news from my aunt See my aunt was at the time one of the highest ranking public servants in the State and was approached too She had the same feeling as I did and blocked him out but that got her curious She discreetly looked into the inner workings of his business and his accounting She was not pleased with what she discovered to say the least Word quickly got around to stay the fuck away from that man My father who is the owner of one of the biggest newspaper of the place began to investigate and was quietly notified by the police to back off A year later the man was arrested The formation he was supposedly providing his students never existed Only one class ever graduated He took millions from his school to funnel into his failing business with whom he had made the school sign a contract for paid services (a HUGE legal no-no) And thats without talking about the wages he took from the school that were unheard of for a school of that size Quickly it appeared that the school mainly served as a way for high ranking people to network together and go on  teaching trips  in foreign countries The police arrested a lot of high ranking public officials that funded him discovering payouts or in some cases sexual relationships between them and some of the workers of the school (which is illegal in my country: if you have a  personal interest  in a place you cant decide anything related to that place) The trial is impending TLDR: years ago I declined a job offer by a man I immediately distrusted Some times later he tried to bully me in my new job to help him out in his new business I refused A year or two later he got arrested for corruption and fraud,MrBlackTie,16348570750,6

This was a bad decision but it saved my ass The reasons for this decision being bad was the crew life We went from city to city state to state selling subscriptions in parking lots and door-to-door It sucked but I was good at it and had some fine adventures Everyone else seemed to be into meth or cocaine or heroin except for two kids from Oklahoma who I instantly got along with I kept copies of every subscription I sold which included the addresses and names of the people involved This quirk (and my habit of keeping every piece of paper for years) would later save my freedom and my future The first nuke I dodged came in Wisconsin Sometimes crews would send a team with a car handler to a separate location (a "spur") I did not get along with the car handler who would lead the spur I told him I didnt want to head out with his spur and he said "Get on or get beat" I had been on the road for almost 7 months by this time and never gotten into any scraps I just didnt feel like half the shit they argued and fought over was worth it But this was and I wasnt going to head out with a hard-drinking idiot who drove like a maniac in the best of times Short version of the dodged nuke: The car handler tried to beat me up and got a busted nose a raccoon mask and a sore set of balls for his trouble The POS tweaker who usually helped him "assert authority" in the past did not wish to join in Three days later the crew manager picked me up outside the Harley factory (after a rad day selling to assembly line workers) and said "Well theyre gone and I wanted you to know before you turn on the TV" The car handler drunk in Minnesota had rolled a van with 10 other young adults inside killing them all Two of them were close friends and the rest were just lost souls that liked things I did not (mostly drugs) The crew manager who was in some ways a decent guy couldnt handle the guilt and offered to get us hired on with other crews He was done with the business But it was time for me to go home and start school in a month so he paid me out thanked me and drove me halfway to CA (to TX) and got me a plane ticket home Along the way we hit a lot of strip clubs bars and pretty amazing restaurants he had discovered near hotels over his years in the business We became good friends on that last road trip Back home I had just settled into an apartment and called a friend to say I was in town and wanted to go buy some furniture I didnt know that the whole time before I returned my ex had convinced everyone I was stalking her harassing her husband-to-be/E-club sleazy hookup While I was gone she had filed for protective orders (which they never served and were thus dismissed) and had regularly filed police complaints about new "incidents" She told the Sheriffs who were trying to serve and find me that I was "hiding out and selling drugs to get by" Within an hour of that call to a friend who truly thought I had gone rogue and underground and was terrorizing my ex my door got kicked in and I was arrested I had no idea what for What I did have was receipts; 7 months of them all over the USA from WA to NC to Michigan What the police had was 5 reports one every month and a half of me assaulting menacing calling or burgling her I was shocked but I was innocent and knew it I kept my mouth shut and demanded a lawyer My Public Defender tried to sell me a deal which I was not having one bit of She demanded I explain how I would defend myself and I mentioned my magazine sales receipts and gave her my crew managers home phone number Two days later the charges were dismissed After that hearing her squid guy served me with her fresh DVRO 10 days later the fresh attempt at a DVRO was dismissed with prejudice when I showed up to the the hearing with receipts and a written and Fedexd letter from my former boss and now loyal amigo Nuke dodged She left state with her POS sailor who had finished his enlistment They apparently had a rocky relationship after the first kids were born She cheated on him often and he has hung in there I have seen pictures of their kids (we still have childhood friends in common and people always want to know about that time in my life) She looks haggard too Two of her kids look like a guy she cheated with from MySpace something I was made aware of by one of the same trashy friends (who is friends with one of my sisters) who took her to the E-club and now gleefully spreads news of her shitty existence She has filed multiple restraining orders against her cheat-exes and a couple against her husband is diagnosed as having a BPD and suffering from manic depression The Nuke I dodged there was that I loved her and I might have even taken her back after she cheated She contacted me on FaceBook and I immediately quit the app completely when I started feeling sentimental Holy crap No lady!

hhim5v5,qcqv9v,So After the death of my father in 2002 my mom didnt have a lot of money so we didnt go on hollidays for the next 2 years my sister was still in Uni and i had just gotten out of elementary school My mom and dad both were teachers so we were used to a more than decent standard of living and 2-3 hollidays a year but times where difficult and we stuck together and even 9 year old me got the message But in 2004 my mom suprised us right after christmas we would go for a vacation! Me and my sister were overjoyed! So we went to a travel agency and my mom told us since it would be her only christmas present to either of us we could decide where we wanted to go i wanted to go far where it would be warm in winter my sister wanted to go to asia because she had never been there So we settled on Thailand This was around October We picked a great hotel 10 days ALL THE GREAT STUFF We were SO ready for that! Then early november rolled around and my moms car broke down And 90% of the holliday budget had to be used for the repair We were absolutely devastated but my mom was determined to make up for it We booked a cheap trip to mallorca as a consolation and left on december 25 There we rented a small car and spent our days driving around the islands discovering beautiful corners i snapped an AWESOME picture of a palmtree infront of a snowpowdered mountain The hotel was cheap as hell we had barely any amenities the only luxuary we had was the cafe de palma every day where we ate cake that tasted absolutely heavenly the whole holyday for 3 people was i think around 500-700 euros at the time it was only a short 5 day trip but it was a great time and i loved fireworks so i was absolutely fine with being back for the 31dec So fly back home unpack and settle back have lunch after which we turn on the TV (our hotel didnt have one and we didnt keep up with the news) And the evening news come up A report about a big tsunami in the indian ocean that hit thailand And then we see the footage from the location which made us all mortified That was our hotel the one me and my sister picked being crushed like it was made of paper by the wave my whole family would most likely have perished if my moms care didnt break down I dont go on vacations outside of germany anymore :|,Ov3rdose_EvE,16348383750,5

hhjbkq5,qcqv9v,This is weirdly coincidental because I just watched a video last night about one of the guys involved which had randomly popped up on my YouTube feed [He regrets his actions Fuck him](https://youtube/7LnM3xGOIPM) It was May 2000 This was in the days of good old AOL with the loud ass dial up tone A few of us cut class and took public transit from the Bronx out to Jersey to try to bag shorties for prom which was coming up soon We had a good time but I do not think any of us actually brought any of them to prom We hung out pretty late then headed back to the city to split up and go home to our respective boros My best friend since we were 8 in the third grade lived right around the corner so we took the 7 back to Main Street We must have gotten to the last stop around 11/before midnight because Wendys was closing soon I was hungry and wanted to grab something but my homie was tired or didnt wanna go since they were closing up shop and basically said he wanted to go straight home He persuaded me so we continued on our walk to our respective cribs Having school the next morning I woke up to the sound of choppers overhead Going to take the bus I saw mad news helicopters and a large police presence on the streets It was apparent there was something going on but I was still not sure what Later we found out there had been a massacre in that same Wendys by 2 guys who had robbed the place One of them was previously a worker who I believe may have served me chili and nuggets in the past Either way I am extremely glad we never went that night Who knows WTF couldve happened I was best man at his wedding years later His wife was one of the girls wed met that night  RIP to all the innocent lives lost that night I wish the survivors the best in life,j0k3rNhArL3y,16348486400,3

hhiy27g,qcqv9v,After a few years of teaching I felt that it wasnt really for me and I went and got another masters in library science while working as a permanent substitute in the meantime (perm sub means I work in the same building every day and have guaranteed work) I had an interview for a part-time childrens librarian position and accepted but the pay was low enough that I didnt want to stop subbing so I was going to try to work both jobs The library was an hour away from my house and the shifts were terrible times (5-9 pm Tue-Thurs and every Saturday) so I knew that I couldnt sub 5 days a week and wanted to switch to per diem subbing so I could have a more manageable schedule I told my assistant principal that I wanted to step down as a perm sub and switch to per diem and I was giving him two weeks notice That date was March 13th 2020 the last day both the school and the library were open for that school year due to COVID Since the library was closed the job offer fell through (the library opened again but had limited hours and no longer had the available position) Once this news hit I immediately emailed the assistant principal and rescinded my two weeks notice telling him that the second job was no longer happening While school was closed and eventually switched to virtual it was really unclear what would happen to the subs It was eventually decided that the perm subs would continue to get paid throughout the school closure as long as we attended meetings a few times a week while the per diem subs were out of work I got an email a few weeks in from the assistant superintendent saying that he heard I verbally resigned and then rescinded my resignation and asked me to explain I told him what happened and he agreed to let me stay as a perm sub Had I been offered the library job a month earlier and officially went to per diem subbing I would have been jobless for the rest of that schoolyear and made zero money During that time my husband and I closed on a house and that was only possible because I had proof that I was continuing to make money during the school closure Things could have been very different,Gneissisnice,16348432070,3

hhimmnt,qcqv9v,I was actually on a trip in italy when the outbreaks were happening It was a sports tour so it was something like 40 players and 10-15 parents and a couple coaches and every 3-5 days we moved to a different place First we were in Milan got to see the city center and the cathedral it was so cool and amazing to see it really Then we moved and visited Venice and everything was still normal tourist destinations were bustling and full of people At this time Covid was still on the other side of the world we had that sense of security "yeah well be fine" Then we moved on to Rome got to see all of the architecture and parts of the city even played some of the sport against Italians (we got curb stomped) We stayed in Rome for about 5 days until getting on a plane and heading back to the US Customs and everything was basically empty the only thing even related to Covid was a single question before boarding the plane in Italy was just "have you been to China recently" or soemthing like that I vividly remember a friend texting me when I first got to Rome saying "hey arent there outbreaks and lockdowns in northern Italy right now?" And I just remember responding like "pffft what are you talking about I was just there theres no lockdowns" because I had been there not even 5 days ago but then when I got home 5 days later I saw the news of all of Italy being locked down and thought "holy shit there was outbreaks in Italy wild" I often think how lucky my entire team was to not get stranded there for months and how completely oblivious we were to having a much much worse 2020 than we were already going to have,technoteapot,16348385650,2
hhip6nu,qcqv9v,I got into a rather shady job back when marijuana was getting legalized in my state The person I was working with (Ill call them Q) had this house in a very upscale neighborhood that was like a mcmansion and a full unfinished basement where I would be in charge of setting up probably the largest grow op Ive ever ran but supposedly this was all legal when talking about it with Q I got through a couple of harvests when one day we were down in the basement and the door rings and Q is visibly worried and asks me to go check it Me being under the impression this was all legal I had no problems and answered the door to two detectives who were looking to talk with the owner of the house Q I told them I would see if he was in and went to get him but he just ignored them until they left At this time there was also talks between Q and I that this was going so well that they would be putting the house in my name (covering the upkeep costs) and have me move in their full time to live AND buy me a brand new luxury car because my shitbox of a ride wasnt good enough to be in the neighborhood which to a young adult in a supposedly legal job that did sound like a nice bonus Well after the visit from the nice detectives and seeing how my boss reacted I knew something wasnt right and decided it was best to get outta that position before something bad happened I ended up telling Q I just wasnt seeing the same vision as them or something and wished them well and that was that until not even a week after I left police raided the house and it was all over the news Smart thinking and not getting caught up in the bonuses saved me from apparently a lot of fines charges on my record and probably some jail time because Im pretty sure we had more plants than we were supposed to and probably violated some housing codes so they could get the juice they needed to run everything without tripping a normal breaker Pretty sure we were using 220v system like in a factory but since I didnt handle the electrical box install I could be wrong,Medicatedwarrior365,16348396100,2
