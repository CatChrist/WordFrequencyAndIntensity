This was just an interview my roommate is expecting me back and you never even asked my availability? I guess I am missing class today?? I am in heels??

She had COMPLETELY buzzed her entire hair off after having mid back lengthed hair since she was a little girl But it looked my she was enlisting in the army but it was done in the dark I look at her and was in shock I didnt know what to say A few hours later my older sister says to get on Skype to a group video chat with my younger sister My older sister and fianc are looking into the camera like they are planning a murder Needless to say this was a big deal The following day my two sisters met and the older one had a long letter that she read to her saying how she is disappointed etc A few months pass and the younger one says she will wear a wig The older sister and fianc agree By the end of the summer 2020 and they decide to move the wedding to October 2021 because of COVID MOH still has apparently "done nothing" But its clear she is keeping her short hair which has grown in now and she has it styled nicely Now its 3 months until the wedding and the younger one is refusing to wear the wig (she never ordered one) But my sister and her fianc are so adamant about her wearing one that my mother is calling me for advice of what they should do The older sister and fianc are complaining that everyone will have "down dos" except her (there way more to it than that - like the younger one always gets away with stuff without thinking of the consequences) while my mom says the younger one is not feeling loved for her being her These events have caused a whole rift in the family dynamic My wife and I have nicknamed it HAIRGATE SCANDAL My younger sister and the fianc used to have a great relationship - like getting funny or meaningful gifts for Xmas Now its awkward at best One hand we (edit: my parents not we/me) want my younger sister to feel loved and appreciated on the other hand its my sisters (edit: their daughters) WEDDING Lets see what happens Oh also the fiancs mom is requesting they change the wedding venue 3 months out!

h4iojgu,og6dcv,I was in The Grotto Bruce Peninsula National Park in Ontario I watched some divers emerge in a pool in a cave and I asked where they came from They said there was an underwater tunnel that went out to the Georgian Bay Cool! I want to swim the tunnel So I waited for the divers to go back then I took off my shirt shoes and socks and got into the water No mask fins snorkel just me I found the entrance to the tunnel and started swimming out As I swam I realized I never asked anyone how long the tunnel was and I also had no idea how long I could hold my breath or how far I could swim underwater So Cant turn around only way out was to keep going Obviously I didnt drown When I emerged from the lake side of the tunnel there was a sheer cliff so I had to swim a ways until I could find a place to climb out Then I had to walk barefoot back to the cave climb back down to get my shoes and socks and shirt There was a small crowd of people just standing and staring at the water I asked someone whats everyone looking at She was quite upset almost crying "Some guy jumped in the water! He went down and never came back! These are his clothes",TheGratePumpkin,16257786670,34
h4smuyw,og6dcv,In 2012 I was at a friends house with a girl I was seeing and there were 8 or so other friends there some of whom lived there One of the homes occupants was a known drug dealer He mostly sold weed but also sold several other drugs We all knew this and some of us worked with/for him Someone who isnt me had recently moved back from a nearby city and was out on bond for drug distribution charges where he also had a lot of drug connections and he would routinely transport material there for sale During this particular time a nearby coworker had recently been robbed and beaten so the general rule was both doors (front and back) stayed locked unless someone was coming or going A friend of mine asked if I wanted to smoke a cigarette I said no because I didnt want the girl I was with to be turned off by me smoking My friend got up and exited the back door to the house and walked around to the front to smoke He left the door unlocked and we didnt notice A few minutes later the back door flew open and 3 or 4 masked men rushed into the house with guns and ordered everyone to the ground We hesitated at first until one of them pistol whipped another friend sitting across from me and the girl I was with When we got on the ground I put the girl under me and I got on top of her They asked where the dope was at several times No one answered at first but soon one person and then other began saying that it was in one of the bedrooms and pointing The front man on this crew of guys would pistol whip anyone who held their head up to speak They kept asking the same question until I pointed at the door to the room and began yelling that the dope was inside THAT ROOM I was pistol whipped once The guy kept pistol whipping one friend who was laying in the middle of the room because he was an easy target After a few seconds we heard a gunshot While assaulting my friend in the center of the room the guy accidentally discharged his pistol into his back The bullet struck his heart and killed him For a few seconds we all thought that we were next but when we didnt hear anything else we looked up and the entire group had fled They were caught later and the trigger man was 17 years old and the others were a little older The killer received 50 years in prison the other 3 received 20 years [https://wwwwyff4com/article/men-sent-to-prison-for-involvement-in-death-of-clemson-student/7011424](https://wwwwyff4com/article/men-sent-to-prison-for-involvement-in-death-of-clemson-student/7011424),Tremolo499,16259983970,5

h4i65do,og6dcv,I was robbed at gunpoint some time ago There were two of them and I really believed they were going to shoot me Neither had a shirt on because they were wearing them as ninja masks The shorter one had a tattoo across his chest I dont exactly remember what it was He was the one in control like he had done it before The taller one seemed unconfident and hesitant as if he was afraid of his partner Something freakish that happened was that the tall guy lowered his gun at some point and cast a panicky look to the other one and said to him "I know her" and even tried to gently touch his arm in an attempt to make him lower his gun too I dont think I knew him not from what was visible of his physical appearance I remember imploring "please dont do this" and "I only have $5 (ha! I know)" which I tried to give them but the shorter guy instructed me to toss it on the ground which I did making the bill into a little ball Then he said I could go I did thank them out loud After I turned around to walk away I was half expecting to get shot My mouth felt so dry I sometimes wonder if that tall guy really knew me from somewhere (you know one of those people who crush on you but you never even knew they existed) or if (most likely) he just said that to try to defuse the horrifying situation I go back to this and think what if he lied to save me because otherwise that guy would have surely killed me?,Chkn_Permission,16257702490,2
h4i7dbd,og6dcv,Im a scuba diver so i spend a lot of time in the ocean This one time I risked going into the ocean during a really wavy day I just figured if I could swim under the waves and get pass the breach point Id be fine I did that and started to swim around and look at the floor I got distracted and entered the breach point Since the breach point was around 45 ft deep from the surface to the floor Im already pretty far below the water With the waves stirring up my mask was easily susceptible to being pulled off Which is exactly what happened Now usually all you have to do is put it back on and eject the water But since the waves were aggressive as hell they just jostled me around like a ragdoll and made it almost impossible to reach my mask even though it was still attached to my suit I thought to myself oh christ Im so dead I actually did pass out for maybe 10 seconds before Im coughing up water and laying on the beach So no major injuries but I might have some brain damage due to a lack of oxygen for such a long time Probably not thought,L3mth6,16257707870,2
h4i86xx,og6dcv,I was on vacation on Maui snorkeling on the East side cant recall the exact beach Im male age 40 I had been snorkeling the entire week without incident and I was feeling pretty confident I was snorkeling (just mask snorkel fins) exploring the edge of this reef that was kind of arc shaped as it extended out from the beach and I was on one side of it I got out pretty far (I was alone my wife and other bathers were on the beach and there were no lifeguards) I was swimming along one side of the reef being careful not to get swept over it Some of the coral heads were pretty shallow and I didnt want to run into them or break them I was keeping reef aquariums back at home and was very aware of how fragile the coral tips were and the dangers of touching some of the other things down there Once I got out about a hundred yards I decided to turn around it was only then that I first realized I was in a strong current that I hadnt noticed earlier It was pulling me sideways relative to the beach toward the reef and I had to swim hard to fight it and resist being dragged over the razor sharp reef It was then that I started to become conscious of my breathing through the snorkel I began losing my breath and found I wasnt able to suck in enough air through the narrow snorkel to feed my screaming lungs My body sensing this naturally tried to gasp for air and breathe even more heavily It was at this point that I first became concerned about making it back to shore and fear started to set in I kept swimming back to shore fighting the current thinking about how the snorkel was not giving me enough air with each breath and that I would have to stop at some point to catch my breath Imagine just finishing a 100 meter race and you were out of breath and tired then suddenly there was a bear there that started chasing you and you had to run even faster but couldnt catch your breath Thats how it felt I tried lifting my head above water to grab some air but the water was choppy and I got half a mouth of seawater when I breathed in I was worried I would inhale seawater and start gagging plus I was only feet away from the reef at this point and I didnt want to hit anything with my feet while I treaded water I thought about floating on my back for a bit to breathe which would have worked on a calm day but the choppy water had waves rolling over my mouth risking seawater in my lungs and gagging would have made things 1000 times worse I desperately needed every breath I tried floating for a bit facing down trying to catch up breathing through the snorkel which didnt help my muscles much and of course now my lungs and abdomen were getting tired from fighting the snorkel to breathe I also noted that the current was carrying me toward the reef where I didnt want to go so I couldnt stay motionless for long So I decided to stick with breathing through the snorkel and pressing on I also looked at my options I thought of calling for help but had no way of signaling people on shore I could probably pop up for a moment and get one shout out before I slipped under again and that might be the last time assuming they even heard me Any hope my wife was watching me was slim because the waves would have hidden me up until now I started to think about what would fail first next as I continued along in oxygen deficit Would my body force my legs to stop kicking from fatigue or would my brain black out first? Neither sounded like a good outcome I also considered letting the current take me over to the reef where it was shallower but I didnt want to risk that either although I considered it as a last resort It was at this point that I started thinking about drowning How drowning is a silent death I knew that pushing my lungs too far would engage a breathing reflex that if done at the wrong moment would fill my lungs with seawater and that would be the end Id never recover from that my buoyancy would drop and Id slide below the waves I thought about where Id end up probably miles away thanks to this current and my wife simply wondering where I went As I swam parallel to the reef I started to to take notice of what was underneath me There were large rocks along the sandy bottom The one thing I had going for me was that the water was remarkably clear and I could easily see 50 feet out underwater I began noticing some of the rocks on the bottom rose higher than others and started scouting to see if any were less than 3-4 feet below the surface ones I could possibly get on top of and hold on to so the current couldnt pull me off and give me a chance to catch my breath All I would need was a minute just enough to get out of this panting stage I was in I finally found one that rose like a pillar out of the sandy bottom with a relatively flat top about a foot in diameter I slowly kicked toward it but in the last second when I went to grab it the current pulled me back just out of reach I realized my best shot at an approach would be to swim around the other side of it then let the current drag me on top of it and grab it My lungs were screaming at this point I was blasting each exhale through the snorkel like I was trying to launch the worlds biggest spitball popping my ears every time then sucking in the meager amount of air on the inhale still delivering not quite enough oxygen to my starved lungs My mouth tasted of the saltwater Id inhaled earlier but I didnt dare remove the snorkel mouthpiece to clear it Thats how desperately I needed every single breath I maneuvered around the rocky outcropping and waited as the reliable current slid me over it This current wasnt constant it was fed by wave action so it was jerky It could move you slowly then suddenly jerk you 4 feet before you even felt it I knew Id have one chance to grab the stone I fixated on my stony target as I wanted for the next yank of the current I also looked down to make sure I didnt put my hand down on a spiky sea urchin As the current drug me past I thrust out my right arm against the stone column grabbed itthen used the sweeping current to spin my body around so I was in more of a sitting position legs down head up I figured this would give me the best chance at wrapping my legs around the top of the column to keep the next wave from pulling me off it I was able to connect my body to this rocky column and finally was no longer drifting When youre drifting in a current you dont feel it you only feel it when you grab on to something then you feel it how powerful the current actually was as it tries to pull you off Luckily the muscles in your legs you use to grab onto a column are different than the ones you use for swimming so I was able to hold on Having that control back was exhilarating almost as much as pushing my head above water into the air spitting out the cursed mouthpiece and being able to suck in several nice lungfuls of air as the rest of my body rested caressed by the current I sat there for a few moments My first thought was guilt I hoped I didnt break any corals that were growing on the rock I was seated on As I caught my breath I could turn and look at the beach convinced everyone on there must have been watching my plight and wondering how anyone could be so dumb I half expected to see a small crowd at the waters edge pointing and waving at me But no nothing out of the ordinary Nobody even noticed the guy who just almost died This whole episode probably took less than a minute from the panic setting in to landing on the column but Ill never go out alone or without a PFD again,NotSure2505,16257711450,2
h4i9eo2,og6dcv,A guy with a pistol was suddenly trying to follow my friend through the front door My friend tried to slam the door behind him but the gunman managed to get him arm in the gap faster I was among 4 of us seeing this from the couch My friend - seeing the arm and postol on the wrong side of the door - let go of the door Three of us ran for the back door but another guy with a shotgun came in that way as soon as we reached it I ran for the nearby garage door and my other 2 friends headed into the basement I ran through the kitchen and into the garage slammed the door and realised my mistake You cant lock the man-door from inside the garage Its meant to keep people from getting *in* the house not out I knew the car sized garage door was absolutely wedged in place so I had a split second to come to terms with the fact that I had no control in this situation before a masked shotgun weilding man burst through my only exit I remember yelling "Okay! Okay!" and then being marched back in the house He was behind me with a fist full of my shirt and I felt the barrel of the gun against the back of my head Neither of us said a word as he pushed me towards the second floor When I tell this story people usually assume I was freaking out internally I wasnt I was calm I wasnt scared or angry or sad I was instantly so incredibly calm My fate was out of my control I had no say in this matter What would happen would happen I knew I might die but I was comfortable with it I didnt want to die but I was fine if that was the outcome Ive never felt that level of serenity since In a strange way it was beautiful He brought me to another friends room There were 3 of us and 2 of them The guy with the pistol gun-clapped a friend who fell onto the bed Hurt but fully conscious Following suit I was gun-butted with the shotgun and fell on the bed All 3 of us were now on the bed against the wall and looking at the two gunmen The pistol wielder yelled "Who is [friend]? Who is [friend]!" My friend is good man and gave himself up He was immediately told to open the safe The gunman opened the closet door and pointed to a safe hidden in the back What could he do? He opened the safe We were in college and my friend was dealing pot and other recreational drugs to pay for school They took four pounds of pot and two grand in cash They made a calculated exit and that was that We all survived and my friend learned an expensive but wholly valuable lesson Bonus fact: One of the roommates slept through the entire thing,BloodlustyGummybear,16257716880,2
h4ikbu4,og6dcv,Damn Im late but here is mine When I was about 18 or 19 I had an apartment with a friend I didnt have a job so I just sold weed until I could make rent each month We were just sitting around one night smoking with two girls that basically just stayed in our apartment with us I got a phone call from one guy who was a regular but instead of asking to come through for the usual he asked me if my roommate was willing to part with his Glock 17 It was an illegal Glock black market and unregistered Given my occupation I thought this sounded suspicious so I responded that my roommate had gotten rid of that gun a while ago and that we didnt have any guns in the apartment figuring I was giving the cop who I was sure was on the line less reason to come bust us I told roomy about it right after and we kept rolling and smoking Cigarellos A few minutes later I got another call from my upstairs neighbor who I would sometimes re-up with but found annoying Whenever I had girls over he always found a reason for him and his boys to just show up I screened the call Shortly after I heard a huge bang on the front door Me and roomy just looked at each other figuring that things moved a lot faster than expected and that the cops are here after all The girls ran into my room into the bathroom and jumped in the bathtub I followed and posted up behind the door and grabbed my samurai sword on the way for some reason By that time two more kicks came and the door flew open I expected to hear "Police!" but instead just heard "Wheres the weed at!" Turns out it was the asshole that called about the gun not the cops He was seeing how strapped we were before hitting the lick Him and one other guy with face masks zip tied my roomy while we hid They walked him into my room and put him down in front of the dresser that roomy pointed them to But there was no weed in there just empty gallon bags and scales They both had shitty little guns like a Raven Arms 25 and some silver 32 both Saturday Night Specials But at that range it doesnt really matter When they saw no weed and started getting really hot about ventilating my roomy I looked at the girls looked at my sword and looked at them holding down my roomy I sighed deeply resigned myself to what I was about to do and stepped out of the room unarmed All sound was muted as if through heavy sheets or cotton All I could hear was my heart beating All I felt was my pulse through my ears and the heat in my face as though embarrassed over something I took what I was sure was my last breath and spoke I stepped out and said "The weed is in the kitchen in the drawer there isnt much I havent gone to re-up this week" After the first word both assholes swung around and leveled on me Somehow neither one shot Somehow I was alive They told me to go get it and bring it back I went in the kitchen and grabbed the weed looked out the busted ass door considering my options but went back in the room and gave it to them They just let me walk out of the room with the door wide open Asshole #1 grabbed the weed and pushed me down and made me give him my wallet Asshole #2 left with Asshole #1 right behind My roomy rolled over and yelled at me to untie him which I did He chased them out got in his car and chased them onto the highway on-ramp Assholes stopped on the on-ramp and got out and dumped rounds into roomys car which ended up disabling it Believe it or not no one called the cops and we got the cool-ass maintenance man to come fix our door the next day I soon after went out and legally bought my first AK It was a WASR10 The call I screened right before was upstairs neighbor trying to warn me Apparently Assholes parked and came out in masks and just asked the people that were there and on the balcony if anyone had a problem with it if they hit a lick real quick Thats my story,FuneralMist,16257767150,2
h4iw3ny,og6dcv,I dont fully recall all the details and my dad is somewhat mysterious about what happened But when I was younger around the age of 8/9 my dad and I were in the car driving over an overpass Suddenly my dad had to change lanes due to a van moving to our lane I was sitting in the passenger seat and because of the turn my dad had to make the van hit my side of the car The car flipped a few times and eventually came to stop half hanging over the guardrail and half in a tree I remember very well when I looked at my clothes they were red as in they were soaked in blood My dad tried to stop the bleeding and at the same time get us out But he got his leg stuck and wasnt able to do much Next I remember waking up on a hospital bed moving through a hallway and seeing the lights above me Then a doctor puts this mask on my face and tells me to count to 10 I managed to get to 13 and passed out When I woke up I was in the car going home with my mom a few hours later after the accident Apparently I had tons of pieces of glass from the carwindow in my neck and for some miraculous way it missed my main artery They removed a lot of glass and the following year I had to do some regular checks up at the GP since my body was pushing out the remaining glass splinters that the hospital couldnt remove because they couldnt see it,Hagetisses,16257822670,2
h4j0e60,og6dcv,I was working a summer job where all I had to do was sit out at a remote location that had 2 gigantic tanks full of anhydrous ammonia and when a farmer pulled up pulling his little tank I would then fill it Farmers use anhydrous ammonia as a fertilizer and the thing about anhydrous ammonia is that it is water soluble meaning it will rapidly react with the moisture in your body and cause some pretty wicked damage Youre supposed to use proper PPE but the proper PPE was a whole ass gas mask and idk what you know about farming but around here it takes place during the hot as fuck summer so putting on and taking off a gas mask repeatedly all day seemed like too much of a pain in the ass Sometimes a farmer would be out working later than me so he would drop his tank off at the site and I would fill it when I arrived so that he could just come and pick it up whenever he was ready So when I got to work there would usually be a few tanks to fill straight away I had just finished filling the very first tank of the day and as I tried to disconnect the fill line a valve in the nozzle on the tank got stuck meaning it was stuck on open and as soon as I pulled the hose away I took a burst of it right in the face The first thing that happened is that my body just refused to breathe which in hindsight is probably a really good thing but at the time it was absolutely the most terrifying thing I was also fortunate to not have gotten any in my eyes My face took the brunt of it so I was fortunate to just have some burns There was a big tank of water sitting there all summer for just this occasion so I didnt hesitate to dunk my head into bug infested gross stillwater and things probably would have been worse for me had I not Needless to say after that moment I wore the gas mask but only for another month or so as that would be the last time I took that job,kaywalsk,16257843470,2

h36gzoq,nnj3w7,Depression For most of my natural life the natural thought was that death would be more merciful easier But people along my own path have shown me such love and kindness despite my lack of being any kind of interest or benefit that I was aware of Each interaction of simple love  "lick the spoon girl!" from a co-worker who took me under her wing and befriended me at my first job Her family had ties with a family who started beekeeping and making creamed flavored honey She showed me the simple pleasures of life were NOTHING to be ashamed of enjoying She showed new my first steps in being fearless But I wasnt fully done yet Another co-worker complimented my necklace on our first day of training and smiled saying wed be good friends; she later saved my life Not knowing what I was going through when she visited me for the first time told me a story that was handed down to her when she needed it Hugged me and told me she felt compelled for some reason to share We were best friends for years after that I left the state into the unknown when my nesting partner in am RV Meeting people from every echelon Every shade of skin every level of wealth society When it all boils down  were all humans trying to get by trying to do a thing You lose the layers of defense when you can clearly *see* them When you *hear* the desperation when you *feel* the strain of the facade when you hear the cracks in the mask they put up for strangers If there is a small crack that I can reach through in that moment I will make that offering It has always been a positive experience for me I will never forget the small kindnesses that folks have extended to me I will never forget the small lessons even folding a fitted sheet or how to start a washing machine! I hope to be that smiling face that has made that persons day or life easier That being said I am still a total bitch on the road Ive been nearly killed and watched too many people almost die Fuck terrible drivers Especially if youre old Get someone else to drive or learn how to drive properly Turn signals have never been optional and the speed limit exists try to be within 5mph above or below or get off the road If you cant give enough fucks for those two things you need your license revoked on the spot Change my mind I dont wanna die (as frequently) anymore and I NEVER wanted to die on a commute to/from fucking work,blunnyblunders,16247675410,2

gzv771c,nnj3w7,Buddhism Kindness to other people is one of the basic tenets and something that all people should follow I do have a temper and have to remind myself that someone being unkind might be going through a tough time I cant change the world or even the place where I live but I can smile and say "Good Morning" to the security guard and a few times a year give a little gift (like a small package of chocolates or cookies) to a cashier that has been extraordinarily helpful to me or being sure to let pedestrians cross in front of my car or smile at a shop owner and thank him for helping me Little things You should never "expect" anything! Just go about your business being kind to people Period What a world it would be if everyone did that!

gxbwthp,n79n8y,Honestly this whole pandemic I have struggled with severe germophobia my whole life and as a little kid I found out what a pandemic was and was really scared of the idea of one happening at some point within my lifetime The more I read up on pandemics and their history as I grew up and lived with that fear the more likely I came to feel it was When Covid was just a thing in Wuhan I had heard it could be transmissible for weeks before it showed any signs and symptoms and in the modern day of fast worldwide travel constantly occurring on a mass scale I right away felt like theres no way this thing wont become as uncontained as possible in no time I right away started to say that it was going to spread worldwide be a serious issue and that people here (in the States) wouldnt handle it well or act reasonably and would panic and buy everything off of the shelves at first and then immediately not take it seriously at all and call you weak if you do take it seriously Every one I know laughed at me rolled their eyes and told me Im a crazy germaphobe And then literally every single last detail of every single thing thats happened here in the US - from how bad it got exactly to the early panic buying days to the politicizing of the virus and the way Trump used that to his advantage to how long its been around and how things might start wrapping up and getting back to normal a bit if we can vaccinate - all happened EXACTLY the way I called it play by play like a year and some months ago So idk if Id call everything thats happened unlikely really but at the mental level (and even partially the level of resources/taking precautions the experts tell us to take well before the experts began to tell us to take them - I already had masks/etc and was social distancing before that was a thing here) Ive kinda been gearing up for this my whole life in some ways,PaleontologistNo7501,16204293910,1188

gxe5s7j,n79n8y,Im always carrying a bunch of stuff in my backpack I could be pills (Acetamonophen ibuprophen benadryl) a ziploc bag of tissue a tote bag an oversize thick plastic bag bandaid masking tape small mesuring tape a single shoe lace I found on the ground (not kidding always told myself it could be useful) and a cleaning rag Ive started doing this in secondary school then college then adult life (Same backpack too Ive been carrying it for 13 years I take care of my stuff) --- Why do one need a cleaning rag in his bag? Because you never know One time we were doing a team project in college my friend spilled her coffee on the table I was a matter of time before our documents were soaked Low and behold me the guy always ready for everything pull out my rag and saved the day A few weeks prior to that event still in college I arrive early to my class like always Suddenly one guy whos usually always late came early dropped his bag and rush out since he needed to get his project from the computer at the other end of the building (cause he didnt do it the night before I guess he liked being late) However we had a policy keep the room clean no dirt of melted snow on the floor We are in Quebec and there was snow outside so our boots got all dirty and leave water on the floor and there are folks who dont wear boots and switch to shoes inside instead they just wear shoes and make the place dirty So the guy was rushing and saw the mess he left on the ground in panic he had to get his project on his drive plus wipe the floor before the teacher arrived in the class/studio You know what happens next I pull out my trusty little rag and wipe the floor clean saving the guys fate --- Why do one need a small mesuring tape in his bag? Because you never know We had an evaluation in one of my classes in college we had to reproduce a shoe box a real one we had in the class and animate it in C4D in a matter of time Most people just eyeball it make a rectangular box and calls it a day I cannot simply do some random shape it said "reproduction" I needed the mesurements We were post-production students not the kind of folks who carry the means to mesure object in their daily lives except for me of course cause Im the weird one always ready for everything So I pulled out my mesuring tape at the start of the class before people arrived except for the teacher he was always early and proceed to get the right mesurement from the physical box and thus got a perfect shape for my CG shoebox 96% on that evaluation way higher than most people --- Winter coat Its necessary if you live in Canada A few years ago I got myself one with loads of pockets I love pockets you can store all sorts of things in there A zipploc bag full of tissues a reflecting high visibility bracer spare coins if you need to take the bus and got no cards or no spare change in your pocket and what about a spare set of gloves? I already have a pair of glove why two? Because you never know Still in college we are doing a project where we first needed to film some good looking shots during the night cause we needed night lights on buildings and such So its a winter night a beautiful one too with thick slow falling snow and fridgid air However one guy in our team didnt prepped as well as he thought he forgot to bring gloves and we kinda needed fingers to operate a DSLR You know the drill they knew the drill surprise secondary pair of gloves directly from yours truly Saved him from his demise of frozen fingers --- Congratulation you have been invited to a party in a shack resort friends and frendly coworker will be making a potlock! I hate food waste I grew up in the country side and was frugal before I even knew it was a thing If a group of adult in their late 20s will make a potlock surely there will be leftovers I always keep some plastic container basic one you can buy at the dollar store that I actually got from margerine containers that I cleaned because its the exact same model It sits in my cupboard waiting to get used I brought 5 of them at the party why you ask? Because you never know The potlock was sorta fun but inebriated cooking and inebriated planning before the cooking leads to questionable results Leftovers happenned more than they thought I hate wasting food and the friend who organized the party what a great guy also stated to avoid wasting food as much as possible but alas it happenned No one had containers for leftovers except for good old me who gave my cheap container to save the day and the food I also brought spare reusable shopping bags at the party I was part of the cleaning team lots of stuff was left by the others lots of stuff was brought at my place thanks to those bags I mean there was a whole barely openned can of maple syrup that stuff is expensive I just wrapped it up in saran wrap and put a rubberband (that I had in my bag you guessed it) and it was sealed I put a beer bottle box at the bottom of my bag so it could sit up right --- Covid happenned were all sent home fear settles in and theres no food at the grocery because people bought everything for the confinement?

gxchfdq,n79n8y,The COVID-19 pandemic Id been closely monitoring reports on reddit re: Dr Li Wenliang alerting the public to a strange new infectious respiratory disease that he was seeing more of in patients; I think Id initially heard about it was at the very end of 2019 or in the first few days of 2020 (it was shortly before or shortly after NYE) My mind went into overdrive about what the possible fallout of this could be and decided the wisest course of action would be to prep like we were headed toward the next Great Depression Wed just closed on our first home in late 2019 and finally had a stable space of our own I continued to monitor the situation and as incidents of the virus to increase we took action by purchasing a chest freezer; I did a shit ton of research about gardening in harsh environments and conducted numerous cycles of soil testing and we overhauled our yard into an abundant kitchen garden with loads of different vegetables fruits and herbs and flowers We stocked up on dried goods and cupboard staples restocked our storage water and all emergency kits; we basically we went into hardcore prepper mode for what appeared to be a disaster We made sure our solar panel system was fully functional (to offset the increased consumption costs wed likely incur by being home all the time) Instead of hoarding paper goods like toilet paper we bought a bidet attachment and purchased a modest amount of toilet paper so as not to put any additional strain on supply chains By the time the first mid-March lockdown rolled around in 2020 wed already hunkered down and had avoided most public places for several weeks (save for a trip to the nursery and dispensary fully masked in n95s in late Feb 2020) Even with all of that preparation the pandemic has been a punch to the gut but we were exceedingly lucky My hyper-vigilance has caused me a tremendous amount of anxiety during periods of my life but in this instance it literally kept us safe and protected us from being exposed to COVID and saved us from unnecessarily contracting the virus and passing it on to others unknowingly Though finances have been tricky and challenging to navigate were still alive and covid-free Overthinking a plate of beans FTW,ek-photo,16204407520,1

I started getting concerned in December 2019 By mid-Jan 2020 there was a very high probability that things were going to go really bad but the governments and people were ignoring it as something not to worry about So I decided to take my own precautions Bought a car bought masks stocked up on food etc Also made plans for minimal-contact buying of fresh groceries When people were panic buying in March I just sat at home and waited them out Re other stuff I have a small first-aid kit on me I bought fire extinguishers (including one for the kitchen) because my apartment didnt have any I bought a pump and repair kits and reflective vests etc for the car and the bike (Ive used the pump) I have emergency food and water and heating in the car and at home Ive been prepared for failues of bureaucracy and just general bad luck Ive lost my job a few times and its just routine and stress-free by now Do this contact there refresh here apply etc I just follow my protocol and Im back on my feet relatively quickly This time around took much longer than normal to process the visa though and I had to spend a few months abroad while waiting In terms of life events my biggest critical failure was not expecting COVID to impact closing the distance with my SO as much as it did I didnt manage to convince her to stay; she thought shed be back next month Its been over a year since Ive seen her and itll probably be another 1 to 15 years before we can live together again because visas etc At least theres a high enough chance to see her again this year,masasin,16204413880,1

gxcoc90,n79n8y,Oh shit I just remembered a different story so I have to double comment This one comes from being sensitive to smells and being someone who pukes easily So when I travel I always bring a small "TSA compliant" bottle of super strong lavender oil to mask bad smells Id never had to use it on a long trip before after years and years of flying for work and fun although I came close a couple times due to being put near the rear of the plane by the bathrooms and someone droped a duece whose odor wasnt fully sucked out right away (gag) But finally it happened I was on a public shuttle bus ride that takes 3 and 1/2 hours that goes direct from Recife to Porto De Galias a very nice touristy beach On the way home with an hour left to go on the ride a smell began to overtake the bus that was so bad it literally smelled like someone shat their pants and died At first I thought someone farted but it quickly became eye-stingingly bad To make matters worse the only two windows that could open were near the front of the bus and they could only open halfway The bus was only half full but within seconds nearly everyone was saying various things in Portuguese like "Mother of God! What is this Smell?!" "Please open the windows!" "Bus driver has someone died?!" "Do we need to stop?" Right when I started feeling the gag coming I remembered at the last minute that my paranoid self had packed my lavender oil at the bottom of my beach bag I mean I even brought it to the beach thats how much of an over-packer I was So right when my partner said "Im going to ask the driver to stop I cant do this!" I said "Wait I have the solution!" Got my lavender oil out and we literally slathered it on ourselves and then passed it to all the passengers It was strong enough to kill off whatever the smell that was We never found out the culprit of it Ill never forget the looks on the passengers who literally were saying "Thank you so much! You have saved us! God bless you!" It was something I never in my life thought I would ever have a chance to use to save that many people from such a horrific smell,theaftstarboard,16204448060,1

gxcyblz,n79n8y,Covids effect on stores here in Australia I was a girl scout so "be prepared" is a life motto and Ive had a few really bad times in my life where just getting food has been hard so I now ensure I always have plenty of shelf stable food on hand just in case Im also from SoCal where fire/earthquake/flooding are not unknown so I like to have emergency supplies I moved to Australia about a year before covid and began slowly building up my new food storage and emergency supplies (had to donate all my other stuff) During that time we had a situation where the roads were closed out of Western Australia and there were shortages of some types of foods - fire on one road cyclone flooding the other yes there are only really 2 main roads out its a remote state with a lot of wilderness like hot Alaska Since I dont drive here yet (opposite side of the road hurts my brain) I became familiar with e-commerce and online shopping here in Australia and began to realize that a lot of stuff was dependent on imports and that a lot of websites were not that great so I began stepping up my "prepping" just in case - that experience with the roads showed me that we have somewhat fragile supply lines in Perth - and rebuilt my emergency kit a bit more quickly When I saw the news in China while the fires were going on I bought a bit more than usual during my grocery pickup The staff even teased me a ton about preparing for the end of the world (most people here seem to shop on a as-needed basis so this was me getting like 2 bags of rice and a dozen cans of stuff) Well when covid hit there was a massive run on the stores - every store even the online ones Panic buying was unknown here which made it even more of a frenzy The grocery stores TURNED OFF their online ordering because their systems couldnt handle the demand while other stores had websites that took forever to load and lost orders because they were overloaded so the only way to get food (and many other supplies) was to go in personand even that didnt mean places would be in stock Stuff like canned cat food masks antibacterial wipes bleach batteries exercise equipment just a huge range of everything were just out of stock for weeks or longer Because of our supplies (and the garden I started a few months beforehand) we were able to almost completely avoid stores for nearly 3 months until online ordering came back online and stocks replenished which we were very grateful for as Im immunocompromised I also conviced my husband to upgrade our ute to a nice affordable little used 4x4 since the Ute was getting old and unreliable and we wanted to road trip Once lockdown lifted people in WA were basically stuck here so everyone bought 4x4s and caravans and the prices went up a TON so were grateful for me making that call!,whatisevenrealnow,16204517250,1

gvdaj0k,mvicaw,ER doc The biggest problem is that even though Covid is an enormous health issue statistics are that most of these people will do just fine So they end up with "a cold" or "the flu" just like they have been saying and it just reaffirms their position Some got really sick or had a family member get really sick and it changed their tune Overall I have enough to deal with during my day that I am not going to spend time arguing with idiots It simply isnt worth my breath and debating with unreasonable people is an exercise in futility The biggest slap in the face is all these people who will be in their room coughing with their mask under their chin and when you ask them to put it on they tell you how they cant breath with the mask I just point to their oxygen level on the monitor and ask again to put their mask on if they would like to be seen today,sailphish,16190385370,65

gvds9le,mvicaw,Sort of related but I felt the need to chime in Im a new ICU nurse that started working roughly 8 months ago We had a young patient (<35 years old) that wasnt admitted for COVID but we were all pretty certain that they had it previously and their lungs were significantly damaged resulting in their admission This patient was on high flow nasal cannula for a while but progressed to 100% BiPaP (a mask you wear which forces air into your lungs basically the closest thing you can get to a ventilator without having a breathing tube) This patient would routinely desaturate to less then 30% with their mask off I am not exaggerating here Normal pulse ox sats are 92-100% Incredibly sick patients in respiratory distress coming into the ED can be in the 50-60% range Again LESS than 30% perfect waveform and everything Unbelievable Regardless the conversation of intubation (breathing tube) was brought up multiple times to the patient and family The family refused every time claiming that putting the patient on the ventilator was just the hospital trying to make money off of them During one of the final conversations with the family it got so heated that our hospital security had to come and escort the family out after the team pleaded for them to try the ventilator as it was basically the only chance they had in saving the patient Family didnt budge A day later the patient coded (heart stopped) and the patient had to be emergently intubated They were able to bring him back but less then 24 hours later they coded again and passed away I didnt directly work with this patient but it was incredibly frustrating to hear about Us nurses often joke about the "big nursing bucks" that we make Granted I feel fairly compensated most of the time but no one in their right mind in the hospital is in it solely for the financial incentive I have met some absolutely brilliant people working in the ICU who likely could have made 10x their salary working in another field People dedicate their lives working to hopefully be able to save someone elses The idea that healthcare workers are out here to make money related to the horrific situations of others is absolutely ludicrous,tozli,16190467900,30

gvd3n23,mvicaw,Not to digress too much but I got accused of being a covid denier by doctor at my HMO I cant stress this enough: just because you are NOT freaked out about covid doesnt mean you are a denier Im in great health Was under 50 and yes always wear a mask and only ever left the house for groceries Last April (wow one year) half of the police department i worked at eventually tested positive We were deemed essential workers It turns out all the social distancing in the world did not keep me from assisting at risk people homeless junkies and people down on their luck who were in fact positive for covid Believe me; I have so much empathy for the people I serve and help every day And if I had to do it all over again I wouldnt change a thing I was and am very cautious But I never lived my life in fear Please dont mistake that attitude with being a denier Mr Doctor Like most people with common sense i made sure my elderly parents were hunkered down and away from people I feel so bad for the many people that lost loved ones As for me I still dont think my sense of smell has been the same since But its still better than dying,RandyRhoadsLives,16190356050,1

gvdon71,mvicaw,I am a physician and regularly care for patients with diseases far worse than covid so maybe my perspective is warped If anyone would like a different perspective here it is Just like in others areas of life there are varying attitudes amongst physicians and I have many peers who agree with me The data in the effectiveness of cloth masks preventing the transmission of a partially airborne highly infectious respiratory virus in the community is weak at best And even if they did work It is curious why some are so desperate to believe they dont work both ways (they only prevent the virus from getting out not getting in which from a biophysics standpoint is highly dubious) so asymptomatic bystanders must be mandated by law to conform to the neuroses of those afraid of a virus with a survival rate well over 99% for all comers that mainly kills the morbidly obese and those near the end of their life who would die from a variety of infectious causes should they contract them We should be able to discuss what the value of liberty is in this society and make individual risk assessments about what is appropriate If you are scared you might die from coronavirus the solution is not to make everyone on an airplane wear a marginally effective (at best) symbol that you can see to calm your nerves the solution is to not get on an airplane because that is something you are personally uncomfortable with Its an incredibly selfish and dishonest way of thinking The retort is that X amount have died dont you care about people dying? The uncomfortable truth is that people die from all sorts of things that is the nature of life and when we leave our house and engage in normal life there will always be risks If this virus had a 25% death rate wed be having a different conversation But it doesnt No one wants to think about this rationally and lets be honest there are plenty who love the masks because they are a visual symbol to identify what you believe and they love the fact that they can force other people to wear them in public because they know they hate it This kind of thinking all goes together Only the government can determine how you should act what you should wear where you can go and how you should be able to protect yourself and your family etc It is disingenuous to boil this down to "if you question the efficacy of masks or the constitutionality of mandates regardless of efficacy then you must be a rather stupid person and we should shame and make fun of you" It is much deeper than that and what arguments like that really are are ad hominems that try to shut down debates and bully everyone into agreement There are plenty of my physician colleagues who agree with me and up until last year when masks became politicized because of mandates based on weak/no data it was well understood in the scientific community that only fit tested n95 masks conveyed any meaningful level of protection and that surgical masks offered little benefit outside of a healthcare environment and certainly not homemade cloth masks What changed? Politics Was there a study that suddenly showed people can safely engage in normal activities with masks on? No but there was a randomized trial from Denmark the Danmask study that at the very least cast doubt on the efficacy of mask mandates but it is verboten to discuss it yet we routinely cite far weaker studies on a daily basis The fact that Dr Fauci is wearing his cute masks with cartoons on it after receiving the vaccine speaks volumes Yes you can still get the virus after receiving the vaccine but the vaccine reduces the odds by orders of magnitudes and significantly lessens its severity of you contract it So your already extremely low odds of death from the virus are now even more extremely remote There is no level other than zero that will satisfy Dr Fauci and the fear mongers because they know there is a decent chance this pandemic will be endemic and the virus will not go away Does that justify permanent suspension of liberty for the rest of our lives with the government telling you where you can go and what you have to do and wear on public? We lived with smallpox a far more deadly virus for a very long time and it was one of the few infectious diseases we were able to eradicate completely with vaccines Yet we did not shut our societies down and isolate everyone during the process People died from smallpox Lots of them That is the nature of life The whole thing is pathetic And its especially sad when highly educated doctors tell people they need a vaccine after recently recovering from covid (they dont) and that we need to keep wearing masks despite having immunity (we dont) Its obvious there is something else going on If you want to wear a mask in the community nobody is stopping you By voluntarily wearing a mask you are basically saying that you disagree that this virus has any significant aersolized component (it does) as the aerosol cannot be contained by non n95 masks So if its droplet only then just stay a few feet away from people without masks on if you are going to be around them for more than a few minutes Problem solved Or just get the vaccine and live your life normally without ever worrying about masks or distancing again Once you get the vaccine the pandemic is essentially over for you Period So stop,RangeOrnery,16190450240,-20

gw7yuwq,n0jxcp,Ok so after the Cold War a bunch of Russians and Russian families came over to the US After the 80s boom in animated series had basically spread worldwide there became a larger market for independent cartoon studios especially overseas for some reason Those same Russians were basically just itching to draw and happy to take crap pay for those jobs too! We started to see uniquely styled stuff like Rugrats Ah Real Monsters etc Not to mention a bunch of movies like Jumani Dumb & Dumber and The Mask started getting animated pilots some of which got the green light for airing and more episodes Well The Mask did Jumani had like a handful of episodes the likes of which were kinda scatterbrained if you ask me The movies werent a surprise but being that at the time the only thing running in the US were 80s reruns Looney Tunes and typical Saturday morning kid blocks some networks were willing to try out new content Unless you count Disney which frankly were beating their old barely technicolor stuff into the ground at that point So youd get all these tiny studios with Russian independent artist some of which barely new English at these pitches But some had an interrupter fumbled their presentations or were (kinda) lucky enough to have been snatched up by an exec willing to give them a shot but wed see an influx in those unique styles or there were the REALLY lucky ones who went to college not like just a degr- OUCH hey wait arent you going to call my home and demand a ransom?

gyhzis5,nehqa9,So this rule doesnt sound very stupid until you understand the context Our school had a front gate and a back gate and until late 2018 students could enter and exit the school through either gate to go home In like September 2018 a random woman walked into the school through the back gate to speak to a teacher about a football that the students kicked over the fence into her garden and she wanted to return it They told her to get off the school property and threatened to call the police The woman went back home promptly and the school told us that back gate would now be closed because a stranger entered school grounds and it posed a threat on us We would only be allowed to enter or exit the school via the front gate So that sounds fairuntil you find out what happened in late 2016 Our school was in a gang-occupied area in that it wasnt particularly dangerous if you werent involved but a fair number of students were part of some gang by the age of 16 Well in 2016 someone in my year got into beef with a local gang (rumours were that he lost a very valuable stash and couldnt pay up) So about 8 gang members jumped over the fence and broke into our school with animal masks and carrying knives They ran into classrooms causing panic trying to find the guy who crossed them Luckily for him they didnt find him and they ran out of the school police had no follow up After this incident the school just moved on as if nothing happened and there were no changes in safeguarding rules I should probably add here we had a rule that we couldnt use our phones in school There was a girl in my class at the time of the break in who was checking her Snapchat story to find some of her friends in other classes recording the men running in the corridors She showed the teacher and we managed to lock the door and barricade it in time She then got a detention for using her phone in class,captaincurry11,16212896940,2

gzxhssx,nns8ge,Not what I was told but what I was *asked* I worked at a lab that makes microchips for several different things One day my other co-worker isnt in so they brought in a new hire to take over her shift for a bit so he could learn the ropes **Within a half hour** of working with this guy he proceeds to tell me that he was dumped by his girlfriend hes lonely and then he proceeds to ask me questions escalating from "Do you have a boyfriend?" to "Do you and him like to wear masks and roleplay sexually in the bedroom?" I have c-ptsd and anxiety from past sexual trauma so this shit just made me freeze up (and being alone in the room with him made it worse) I just kept shaking my head "no" to everything after the first few questions and he just *kept asking more questions* with this creepy fucking smirk on his face Luckily my boss came down and pulled him out of work just as it started to get worse Im extremely glad I worked at a place that had a great HR department+boss Within a few hours the guy was fired and escorted out of the building and then my boss escorted me out of the building and gave me the rest of the day+the next day off Talked to my other co-workers and turns out hed also touched a co-worker inappropriately and she was in the process of reporting it to HR *while I was working with him* which is why my boss came to pull him out of work,forestfluff,16223372440,3
gzxr69d,nns8ge,I used to ride to work every day with a guy Honestly I think it was my first day with him that he started telling me his bank robbing stories He robbed 11 banks on the same stretch of road in Lakewood Ohio How he liked to do how liked using that road because it was mostly stop signs or at least turned into roads that were How he liked to tie a pillow case around his shoulder with a rope then tie a sawed off shotgun to the other one then wear a coat to cover them both How he once put a 44 to a woman face and very politely told her that he would much rather not blow a pretty ladies brains across the wall but he would if he had to And how he always kept a lead pipe and a Halloween mask under the seats of his car just in case he ever needed them He was quite terrifying to say the least yet surprisingly polite We worked at a recycling plant and he had a deal with the boss to take any steel he came across Used to make $75-100 a day just scrapping steel on top of his check,Ardent_Gunner,16223429570,3
gzy6la6,nns8ge,This kind of situation literally became my job We were a nexus point for people without much to do or no place to stay and also when you meet hundreds of people per shift you are 100% going to encounter people just not in the right state of mind that day We were supposed to be open friendly and appear inviting/welcoming And for years people would just spill their guts at a hello Probably meant that they really really needed to get something off their chest but still it can be really uncomfortable So many stories Their whole family died a couple days ago in a wreck/accident/fire A family member or child just committed suicide and they didnt know what to do or were going to kill themselves too People who broke down crying because they dont know how theyre going to pay their bills Or crying because they had bills with us and couldnt take the items they chose home that day (Since I was full time and had been doing it for years I could usually lower the price or just wipe the slate clean if certain criteria were met) Also people who broke down because they just found out they were dying Or a loved one/friend was dying Illnesses and the bills they would cause were one of the most frequent we encountered Blind rage was also frequent Screaming at the top of their lungs losing their shit and throwing the chair they were just sitting on etc Thank god I left before COVID and the mask mandates And its never not uncomfortable when someone casually drops the fact that they were raped the other day Or on a regular basis Mostly women prolly 10-20% were men Or regular beatings Witnessing a beating or death Insane amounts of drugs Powders pipes needles little things of tinfoil lighters elastic bands straws long and narrow strips of paper cotton balls - sometimes with black splotches sometimes red Just everywhere get spilled because they werent careful lifting everything they checked-out or were out in plain sight as they opened their purse or old packs reused We were basically library staff and now randomly made into a social worker And it went on for years and years Turnover got really high especially in part time Some women refused to work the desk anymore which either ended up with them quitting or me and the one other male staff member spending most of the day out front while our own work piled up We were eventually allowed to tell people who would brag to us about their sexual exploits or conquests that we would refuse service if they didnt stop This sometimes led to rage A lot of BDSM people loved having a captive audience before we got to that point People also loved to tell you how big something was that they could fit inside their rectum Men and women Personal achivements were usuall women could fit someones appendage or something of a certain size in select orifaces Mostly men liked to brag about a certain feature of a relationship The hottest the biggest of certain body parts BBW race fetish etc The kids would often drop bombshells without realizing they did so Then wed have people from Youth Services come up and comfort them while we called the police One coworker quit on the spot as soon as a family member came to pick up the kid She tossed her lanyard on our bosss desk and said she couldnt deal with that and left Couldnt blame her though it left me alone to close Youd get real bad burnout Youd just kind of stop feeling anything You still stick a smile on your face to do your job but goddamn There were times where weeks were kind of a blur For me Id go to work and remember the first little bit and then kind of snap back to being aware of being in the moment at closing time exhausted and sad I know sometimes a victim of something horrible just cant help it and they just spill everything thats happened to them But sometimes I would really resent being told all these awful things Because it was the 4th time that week and I was feeling exhausted and numb again About a year or so before I left our desk drawers were stocked with color coded cards about the size of a business card that we could give someone if they started talking about a difficulty they were having Homelessness waw blue abuse was green illness was pink sexual assault/crimes/rape/abuse was yellow not being able to afford anything to eat was red and I dont remember what orange and purple were We could give them that card that would have phone numbers appropriate for the situation A free health screening a low cost or free counciling session survivor hotlines that could put someone in touch with what they needed most CODA etc Apparently we were far from the only place juet overwhelmed with people just unloading themselves because those cards went to us and all our branches fire stations the Annex the Courthouse the BMV etc,Terranrp2,16223539860,2

han19tp,pbzt5b,I stopped masking my autism as much as i used to do Im more open about it now and Ill ask people for clarification rather than desperately trying to read micro expressions Im 56 so autism was largely ignored in girls when I was young and my family was appalled and ashamed of it so masking was expected of me By my early 50s I began having panic attacks I didnt want to leave my house and only did so to go to work I live alone and home was the only place I could be myself and just be autistic One of my coping mechanisms is to rub my right upper arm with my left hand and people sometimes would ask about it and Id immediately stop Now I just say that it helps me cope when Im overwhelmed I love that I accept my autism now and even celebrate it There are some things I love about it and I am finally able to slightly like myself,loridee,16301196870,3
hatiduk,pbzt5b,Buying a bluetooth sleep mask and a Youtube Premium subscription At the beginning of the pandemic I basically stopped sleeping I was too anxious to turn my brain off effectively I spent \~$20 on a sleep mask from Amazon that has bluetooth speakers in the headband so you can listen to sleep music meditations whatever and still block out light The Youtube Premium subscription was worth it because I can listen to 8 hours of rain sounds without ads -- but you can also make a playlist that will play without ads so I can set up several different videos in the order I want to listen to I start with a 10 minute sleep meditation then an hour of binaural sleep music then the rain starts Im usually asleep after the first 10-20 minutes and if I wake up at all at night (thank you cat) I get the soothing sounds of rain to help put me back to sleep This has completely changed my life I get 8 hours of good solid sleep most nights which then makes me less stressed less likely to overeat more likely to get exercise in etc I wish I had been willing to spend money on my sleep sooner,fireworks90,16302544750,3

haj75d8,pbzt5b,Buying a hearing aid Throughout my childhood teenage years and my twenties proved to be rather difficult for me I have several hearing issues suffer from severe tinnitus and get ear infections quite often I am \~25% deaf in my left ear and \~80% loss in my right ear Ive had 2 tympanoplasty surgeries in attempt to avoid having to fix my hearing loss - with no success(one might argue they caused more harm than good) I always felt that someone that young shouldnt have to have one and I almost felt ashamed to imagine myself with one All of my different health insurances policies deemed hearing aids "cosmetic" and they get rather expensive fast (but for whatever reason they would cover surgeries that cost tenfold more) Fast forward to a few months after I turned 30 - I was in a pretty good financial spot and tired of having to rely on lip reading and having to ask people to repeat themselves Not exactly the most "professional" to constantly ask that considering my position at the time was lead community education manager for a large corporation I caved and bought some - and to this day I still consider it to be the single most important purchase Ive made in my life To those of you that dont know what tinnitus is its a constant ringing in your ears Mine is almost the sound you get when you stand up too fast on a hot day - ya know when ya get a little dizzy and think "whoa" I lived with that 24/7 for the last \~25 years Not only am I able to hear a lot better my hearing aids have a tinnitus therapy module that helps "block out" that sound Masking It doesnt stop it from happening just helps me ignore the sound Nonetheless I wish I had broken down and figured out how to get them \~20+ years ago If youre reading this and also have hearing problems do yourself a favor and get one - dont be ashamed It is no different really than someone with eyesight issues requiring glasses or someone needing a cane/scooter/wheelchair Youll thank yourself the sooner you get it trust me,ImNotSoClutch,16300530570,2

gxz92z2,nbaar5,Not necessarily ruined but was a terrible planned wedding that annoyed the guests Back in 2015 I was a plus one with a now ex friend and we traveled to Waco Texas My friend had went to college or something with the bride but had said that she hated the groom because he cheated on the bride but she is forcing marriage out of co-dependence issues Nice Flew into Dallas rented a car and stayed in super sketchy motel in Waco Ga-ross The morning of we drove out to farm lands and when I saw the crops I thought where are we? We pulled up to this trailer / small hall and when I got out I saw there was maybe a small lake nearby When we walked in the bride and groom were getting dressed in front of each other with the grooms men and brides maids I was like uh? Did we walk in by mistake? The bride goes hey! Come on in People were running around in street clothes boxers and the such She hugged her friend but the groom nor his friends never said hi So we walk outside and there was a small setup under a metal patio My guess was it was a mobile hall made to do weddings There was a few people there so we congregated Someone walked out and said OK everyone the wedding is about again please walk down yard to the water down there As we were walking I saw a little awning with some flowers but as I got closer to the water I realize there were cows in it and they were starting to exit to the property across the fence The water was brown and the bank was muddy We were literally in somebodys farm property We and the rest of the guests walked up and saw metal brown chairs (the kind you see in high school assemblies) just randomly placed next to the awning We all started to sit down but then shot right back up because the seats were super hot from the Texas heat I could hear a few girls starting to get pissed because of the short dresses Some just decided to stand Asses burnt The ceremony begins The bride and the gang starts to come down Kind of random themes and music Then the groom comes down with his friends and they are all wearing storm trooper masks Mind you Im down for a Star Wars wedding but nothing else with Star Wars themed so it seemed a little out of place Some people looked back and giggled but most people thought OK? So when the groom came up the ceremony began and while the pastor was talking they laughed the entire time When it came time to pull the rings out the bride and groom were laughing so much that I think they almost dropped the rings or some thing The vows were a joke I dont remember in detail but the grooms went something like "yeah I think youre coolhaha Id like to marry youhaha" By then people in the audience stopped laughing and started to whisper to each other asking what is going on? So once they did the smoochy face someone from the family announced OK everyone time to walk back to the patio and grab yourself some food So we all walked back and there was some Qdoba with some Budweiser being served The first dance came up and the bride began to dancing with her father which was the most awkward dance Ive ever seen There was no emotion between the two They didnt look at each other didnt say anything just seems like they were like OK lets just get this done And then while they were dancing someone else came up and started dancing to near the end of the song I said to my ex friend what the hell is going on? She said I have no idea This is a mess I could see the faces of the other guests and they were so lost Everything else about the reception was awkward as balls The speeches from the grooms friends were about him the entire time didnt mention much about the bride but said something like good luck you too Love and shit Anyways after all the things were said and done the groom and his friends never came to thank us for coming or introduce themselves in anyway Not that I care personally but if someone traveled half the country to your wedding it would be at least courteous to acknowledge them and thank them for coming So it was time to go and that was that The trip wasnt an entire bus because I got to see my cousin who I had never met Shes awesome But Ill never forget how shitty this wedding was TLDR - Shitty planned wedding in Waco Texas In the middle of farmland and some mobile trailer hall No consistency Bride and groom getting dressed in front of each other and friends and guests Burnt Asses from metal chairs next to a poop brown lake with a muddy bank with tons of cows swimming Star wars masks on groom and his friends Qdoba food and awkward reception Groom was a cheater and bride co-dependent,HeyTroyBoy,16209146260,4

gx4frc7,n5mj47,my friend found out after her grandmothers death that she was a total hoe (her words not mine) and none of her family were actually related to her grandfather she found the entire thing very funny on the less funny side of things I found out that when she was younger my own grandmother had been admitted to a mental hospital and was given shock treatment because she had severe anxiety and depression and went into a full meltdown after giving birth to my dad and his brother she hadnt been expecting twins and couldnt handle the stress and the financial burden my dad and uncle were pretty much raised by their older sisters for the first couple years of their lives she got out by pretending to be well again and then internalised everything for the rest of her life I lived with her for a while to look after her and boy howdy she was a very different woman than when I was just visiting her I had to give up about a year and a half later because being mentally ill myself I couldnt handle her when she had psychotic episodes and the PTSD and trauma she suffered from the psyche ward really fucked her up when she went into a nursing home she settled in really well at first until flu season happened and the staff had to mask up she went into full irrational paranoid delusion after that hospital visits were so much worse it was a rough and ugly history thats for sure and it explained a lot about why depression and anxiety run so wildly through our family it was how I learned that mental illness can be genetic,send-borbs,16202829870,3

h0vmnmw,ntofxm,Best I can think of is the Battle of Osowiec Fortress AKA the Attack of the Dead Men On August 6 1915 Osowiec Fortress was under siege by 14 battalions led by Paul von Hindenburg and defended by 900 men Hindenburg decides to use chlorine gas on the fortress Depending on who you ask the Russians hadnt developed gas masks yet or this specific group hadnt yet been issued them so the best they could do was wear a urine-soaked rag like a bandana IIRC the Germans then put on their gas masks and advanced towards the fort only for 100-150 surviving Russians the rest all having been killed by the gas to charge at them The gas hadnt killed them but it had certainly afflicted them Their eyes were bloodshot and well you know how the phrase "coughing up your lungs" means that youre coughing really hard? The chlorine was dissolving their lungs so they were also literally coughing them up as well as their blood They managed to force the Germans to retreat probably more because they were shitting themselves and burn the fortress down before they died,VLenin2291,16230431030,3
h0umplo,ntofxm,The owner of a home healthcare agency where Im from decided to vacation in Florida with her husband daughter and her daughter friend (both girls 16) They were having a great time and a few days in they were walking along a busy boardwalk looking for expedition companies that would take them out jet skiing It was busy and the companies were taking appointments for the next day The girls were impatient and wanted to go now so when they came across two Hispanic men stating they could take them then they jumped at the opportunity The men wanted to only take the two girls and said they had to take them out in their speed boat to the place where the jet skis were The parents insisted on going of course so they all piled into the boat and the guys steered them out into open water After quite awhile of speeding into the open sea all four of them start getting very uncomfortable They all have their phones and begin texting loved ones about where they are etc without being too suspicious Finally all four begin looking at each other and the girls are crying- these men are stone faced not talking to them driving further out into the ocean The mom texts emergency services and explains the situation shares her location etc Finally the boat slows down and the men put on masks with skulls on them Just then several coast guard and police boats surround the boat and apprehended the two men and take the family back to the main land They told the family that they were extremely fortunate- the men were about to shoot the parents and take the girls as they were sex traffickers and this MO had played out several times recently Its easy to look at their situation in hindsight and see all the red flags but honestly the thing that scares me most is how easily these guys were able to pass off as completely normal to tourists on vacation eager for adventure They just blended in Equally chilling is how absolutely lucky that family got because several werent so fortunate My daughter says I shelter her too much but I remind her of this story often,Karmasuhbitch,16230225660,2

haulxj2,pdzzrw,I work as an anaesthesiologist Ive put people to sleep in an emergency situation knowing that they will almost certainly not survive the surgery These are generally situations where without surgery the patient will not survive but even with surgery the chances of survival are still small In most of these instances the patients are too obtunded or arent conscious enough to be aware of the gravity of their situation but in a number of instances the patients have been conscious talking although clearly anxious I try to reassure and tell the person that we wont leave their side that we will take care of them and that they will be fine It kind of fucks me up a bit to say this to someone but I always include the last part because I just dont see the point in telling them the truth I had one guy tell me he felt like he wasnt going to make it I told him he would make it but knew he wasnt going to I put him to sleep knowing that the last human face he would see before he died was mine as he stared up at me as I held an oxygen mask over his mouth and nose Id consider myself quite a resilient person but knowing this stuff is a bit of a load to carry around,shandy_p,16302711940,54628

hauvqnm,pdzzrw,In just the past 50 years that the Baby Boomers have been in charge of the planet and its resources: - Humans eliminated 68% of animal species on the planet - Humans cleared 30% of all forest cover on the planet - The Arctic has lost over 70% of its summer sea ice - Over 17% of the Amazon rainforest has been clear-cut and destroyed - Over 50% of Australias Great Barrier Reef has died On top of that: - 2010-2019 was the hottest decade in recorded history - Animal and plant species are now going extinct at 1000x to 10000x the natural rate - 90% of humans worldwide breathe polluted air and air pollution now kills an estimated 7 million people worldwide every year - Earths glaciers are losing 390 billion tons of ice and snow every year - Greenland lost 329 billion tons of ice in 2019 alone - The "Dead Zone" in the Gulf of Mexico was 8776 square miles (the size of Massachusetts) in 2017 - 225 million people were displaced by climate change between 2009 and 2015 - In 2019 Indonesia announced plans to move the capital city away from Jakarta home to over ten million people because the city is literally sinking into the ocean due to rising sea levels - We consume all of the resources Earth creates over the course of a year in only 6 months now because of deforestation monoculture farming and overfishing In a single generation we have been pushed out of the 10000 year Holocene period of unprecedented climate stability The Holocene was declared dead in 2016 and we are now in the Anthropocene age where the finely-tuned natural systems that Earth benefits from will become *highly* unstable ###But thats not even *close* to the worst part The UNs International Panel on Climate Change released their 6th assessment report earlier this month and it was [the most sobering report card yet](https://theconversationcom/this-is-the-most-sobering-report-card-yet-on-climate-change-and-earths-future-heres-what-you-need-to-know-165395) on climate change and the dire future of the planet However what is even *more* terrifying is what was in the [leaked version of the report](https://wwwfrance24com/en/live-news/20210623-crushing-climate-impacts-to-hit-sooner-than-feared-draft-un-report) before it was heavily edited and officially released Remember every UN nation gets a veto on the language of IPCC reports Even Russia and Saudi Arabia That means every prior IPCC report has neutered the voices of the scientists soft-pedaled the urgency and subsequent events have always outpaced predictions of even their "worst-case scenarios" The last line of the *leaked* report literally said: ###*"If we act now we could feel positive effects in the second half of the century and may avoid human extinction"* *May* avoid human extinction For the UN/IPCC to even consider putting such language in their report is shocking and unprecedented Why such a dire warning? The original Paris Agreement temperature goal was to keep global temperatures under **2C** of pre-industrial levels preferably to **15C** However in the press conference announcing the report the IPCC admitted that we need *every* country to *perfectly* hit their Paris Agreement emission goals to prevent going over ***25C*** of pre-industrial levels by the end of the century **[No country is doing enough to hit the targets set in the Paris Agreement](https://wwwindependentcouk/climate-change/news/paris-agreement-climate-change-policy-tracker-b1766928html)** The authors of the 2021 IPCC report now believe that 15C will be reached within the next 10-20 years ***in all scenarios*** And if we dont take extreme measures (we wont) a realistic estimate is closer to 5-10 years Again 15C was the original Paris Agreement temperature goal 25C is now our **best-case scenario** (read: impossible) The effects of going over 15C will be catastrophic but even at 2C: - Severe heat events will become 26x worse - Plant and vertebrate species loss 2x worse - Insect species loss 3x worse - Decline in marine fisheries 2x worse Rather than 70% to 90% of coral reefs dying 99% will die Many vulnerable and low-lying areas will become uninhabitable and refugee flows will *radically* increase At 25C (our new **best-case scenario** if everyone everywhere does everything *perfectly*) these effects become considerably worse and climate change will be absolutely devastating for large swathes of the globe ###Were talking about a scale of destruction and a body count that our limited human minds cannot fathom right now Human civilization will have to be fundamentally rebuilt Thats how our world will look by the end of the century in our *best-case* scenario Reality is far far worse than the media is reporting ###It gets even worse though Even if there *was* a meaningful reduction in emissions were about to reach a tipping point with the Amazon forest where weve clearcut so much of it that it will no longer provide the CO2 mitigating effects the planet so desperately needs Experts warn that soon the water cycle will become irreversibly broken locking in a trend of declining rainfall and longer dry seasons that began decades ago (a positive feedback loop of destruction) **At least half of the shrinking forest will give way to savanna** With as much as 17% of the forest lost already scientists believe that **the tipping point will be reached at 20% to 25% of deforestation** even if climate change is tamed At the current rate of deforestation 27% of the Amazon will be lost by ***2030*** In addition as the Arctic ice sheets melt away completely in the summer massive amounts of CO2 that was trapped deep within that ice will be released (along with the likelihood of releasing all kinds of unspeakably horrifying pre-historic viruses we know nothing about and have no defense for) creating yet another positive feedback loop that kicks this shit into 4th gear even if we *do* somehow find the will to curb our own emissions in a meaningful way The oceans absorb 1/3 of humanitys CO2 emissions and 90% of the excess heat generated by increased greenhouse gas emissions In addition the oceans hold about 60x more CO2 than the atmosphere Caps of frozen CO2 or methane called "hydrates" contain these potent greenhouse gases keeping them from escaping into the ocean and atmosphere But the ocean is warming as CO2 emissions continue to rise and scientists say the temperature of the seawater surrounding some hydrate caps is **within a few degrees of dissolving them** Our leaders have a plan to get this all under control though *Right?* Most policies to prevent climate collapse are planned somewhere in 2050 the more progressive ones in 2030 It turns out according to an IPCC report due out *next* year [that leaked a few weeks ago](https://wwwtheguardiancom/environment/2021/aug/12/greenhouse-gas-emissions-must-peak-within-4-years-says-leaked-un-report): ###We only have until 2025 (less than 4 years) > Current investment falls below what is needed "by a factor of five" even to hold warming to the higher limit of 2C according to the report Heres the thing that theyre not explicitly stating: ###The true warming of the planet is already 19 C *at the very least* The IPCC says weve had 11C of mean change but [TS-29 says that "aerosol masking" caused global cooling of up to 08C](https://wwwipccch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_TSpdf) which is the smog were putting out from burning fossil fuels **Ironically our own pollution is keeping us cooler (for now)** Yeah This is that earth-shattering "OH SHIT" moment you see in every disaster movie when the scientists realize that things are even worse than their worst-case scenarios predicted Were not fucked **Were super duper fucked** As soon as we switch to greener energy sources we get that debt repaid and fast like a rubber band snapping back We may already be seeing this The sudden warming record high temperatures and massive wildfires we experienced this year could be due to a reduction of aerosols *last* year (largely due to the pandemic and related shutdowns) But its important to realize that the IPCC and others have kept moving the baseline forward If we were still going by the 1750 baseline **we are already at 2C** even without factoring in aerosol masking Its only if you use 1850 or 1880 as a baseline that you can get some of these delusional numbers like 11C ###But wait It gets even *worse* The climate models [in the IPCCs own report](https://wwwipccch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPMpdf) from 2014 predict were currently on track for a heating of somewhere between 3C and 4C by the end of the century But even these projections are all far too conservative optimistic and simply do not align with reality [The IPCCs own data](https://wwwcarbonbrieforg/what-is-a-4c-world) shows that in their conservative "worst-case scenario" (the A1FI scenario) we are absolutely headed for: - A 15C world within the next 5-10 years (were nearly at 12C already according to their math) - A 25C world in 30 years - ***A 4C to 64C world (read: guaranteed human extinction) in 80 years*** The scientists know this The IPCC knows this (which is why they admitted as much in the draft of the 2021 report) Id be willing to bet a large percentage of policymakers know this ###The Bottom Line If were going to actually face reality we have to acknowledge that were actually heading to 8C and above to whatever the equilibrium will become once we are dead and our emissions stabilize,ThePriceOfPunishment,16302755810,15

Ill edit to correct it later But they really dont serve those anywhere over here with an Indian meal - Calling every new season of a TV show a new "series" We dont have "series 4 of Friends" for example That would mean they made a whole new show or spin-off or 3 sequels and this is the 4th mew version of the show - Cheers is not just a show or toast - We bitch about gas prices even when its actually a practical steal compared to your petrol Holy moly the first time I was with a friend who filled up her Ford Puma (a car we dont have here btw) I seriously couldnt believe it could honestly cost that much -Roundabouts which are freaking terrifying (especially those massive multi-roundabout ones like in Hertfordshire that all my UK friends called The Magic Roundabout) -Ground floor first floor You tell us first floor were going inside and stopping right there We wouldnt dream of thinking you mean the floor above the one we entered through -Sweets instead of Candy Another thing they taught me at my English retail job I kept having to upsell candy at the counter and I worked there months before someone told me everyone was laughing because I sounded so American and over there you just call them sweets -Countdown Yes I know the main bloke passed away several years ago God rest his soul but what in the name of all that is holy compels anyone to watch that bonkers show? From the math problem in the middle to the fact that they only win a teapot (right???) Its like the anti-Japanese game show Instead of being so outrageous and over the top you cant believe its for real its so dreadfully boring and low-tech it seems like something my great great grandmother would have watched back when the television was first invented -Before the game Fortnight rose to popularity many Americans would not have been able to tell you the length of time of a fortnight -Courgettes instead of Zucchini fringe instead of bangs -Chavs and how they think theyre some really tough badasses with street skills Id like to see a chav survive one day in the inner city or even a mildly tough neighborhood in Nebraska -Trainers instead of sneakers - Nobody gives AF about some of your celebrities like Lily Allen or Katie Price or that Cheryl whatever who was on our failed C-a factor before they canned her No one has heard of them no one cares,AllyRue91,16187080710,3

h0abyru,nq9fjc,Not 5 stars But 3 stars hotel needed a house keeping temp so I showed up Gross I am never coming back I found clothes blankets and junk outside hidden behind the trees and bushes People live out there This place is shady There was one 1 housekeeper for a place of about 44 units Management expect 30 min per room No longer than that because they need things turn around If we cant get things off we leave it For extended stay guests they get one crappy towel per week The nice towels are reserve for new guys to make an "impression" I seriously saw some of these guys took carts from your unit and go down to the highway (we are next to the highway) Maybe they got hotel voucher but even the when I was cleaning out I was getting hit on by a guest driving in but those guests started asking the guys for money and he drove off upset Damn just overall a shady place The week before was a hostage situation across the lot The view is of white pipes and grass (used to be a landfill site) The housekeeper only has so many sheets and 1 blanket on the cart Most of the time we dont change the sheet or blanket unless it smells like crap (through our masks) or has blood stain The housekeeper knows she is the only one left working so she aint trying too hard to haul blankets from downstairs Clean means bare minimum I have decided that for $60/night hotel this is the quality I get Now I know why the last hotel I stayed at smelled like crap/urine So gross The only good thing is they give different for bathroom room kitchen area etc but when time are limited I am sure there is shortcut She told me this is industry standard of work (not changing sheets/blankets if you dont need to)The previous housekeeper was also a hooker and got fired for not showing up The housekeeper still standing thinks there is prostitution here but doesnt have proof Anyways it is was the most disturbing experience for me If your sheet or blanket smells ask for a new one The chance of them changing it at 3 stars hotel is slim,sweethomeall,16226162380,13

h46b2ne,oe5uja,This comment is way too late but whatever I had just moved across the country and rented a house with two close friends I was waiting at a bus stop coming home from a late night shift Someone else in scrubs and a nurses badge was also waiting We were both burried deep in our phones when a man came up talking non stop about how phones were taking people over and various nonsensical hints that the government was to blame I shouldnt have glanced up but when I did I noticed he had a pair of gloves and ski mask tucked in his back pocket He noticed I had looked and immediately fixated on me demanding I look up from my phone My brief relief when the bus came soon subsided when I realized he was boarding too Grimly I noticed he was staring and making faces anytime I happened to look in his direction; wild eyed goofy ones obviously meant to rattle me It worked I pulled for my stop too early and he noticed immediately stepping up to leave as I step through the folding doors The bottom of my stomach dropped the minute I realized he was following on the other side of the street cartoonishly mimicing my movements Panicked I called my roommates first They were close had a car and could come and get me in minutes They answered but when I explained they said they were too drunk to come and get me but that they should probably get me pepper spray soon and hung up Reeling I realized the person was now laughing at me visibly having heard my half of the conversation Part of me wondered if calling 911 would only prompt him to close the gap and cause me bodily harm I was in an unfamiliar city had absolutely no one else I could call So without much thought at all I called my Dad I dont know why I didnt say what was wrong but instead asked how my step mom was doing after her recent stroke That I loved him and was thinking about him Part of me knew this person was feeding off of my fear and that if I calmed myself and had someone "with me" even if it was just over the phone that would be my best defense I stopped at another bus stop that was well lit and in front of several store fronts that might have cameras and called a Lyft The man turned around and walked away the minute I reached the bus stop suddenly unable to meet me in the eye as I continued to talk to my father staring him down My Lyft came quickly and the conversation with my dad came to its natural end I explained to the Lyft driver that someone had made me feel unsafe coming home and asked if they could please make sure I step through my front door before they drove away They agreed and we spent the rest of our short trip talking about what had happened When I finally stepped through my door I at least expected my friends to approach me and ask if I was okay But as I got ready for bed and eventually encountered both of them they oddly avoided any attempt at conversation or eye contact This followed a pattern of engagement only when they needed something from me but complete refusal whenever I needed support in return I realized years later after reaching out to other friends that their lack of attempt to even call me a Lyft/Uber or follow up the day after should have been a major red flag And Im sure its no surprise I had to buy my own pepper spray tl;dr - I was followed home after work after moving to a new city with two close friends who only offered to buy me pepper spray and hung up when I called for help sighting that they were too drunk to drive,AlternateAlbatross,16255241980,2
h4b4xna,oe5uja,"Alex" and I were friends for 20+ years - through college boyfriends moves careers and career changes Through her multiple surgeries where I cared for her each time and through my ACL replacement surgery where shedecided to completely ignore me when she had promised to help I stayed in my apartment alone instead of going to my parents a few hours away for help because she had assured me shed help me and bring groceries etc While I was recovering alone without her help she called and said I was expected at her dinner party I told her I could not attend as it was icy and snowing and I was on crutches and could not drive She yelled at me to figure it out because if I didnt go it would screw up her headcount I told her she was being a bad friend and she hung up on me She ignored me for weeks and then texted me saying she needed a couple of weeks to cool off Then I started to get angry/irritated texts and phone calls from our mutual friends telling me that "Alex" had been bitching about me and had told them things I had said about our mutual friends in the confidence of our friendship I never even said those things she did!!! But I knew she never valued me as a friend if shed betray me like that and it hurt After 20+ years it hurt bad A lot of our mutual friends stopped talking to me some telling me they were sorry but it was just easier than dealing with her wrath if they kept hanging out with me That also hurt but I had to learn and accept that they chose her over me and we werent as close as I thought The fallout from standing up to her one damned time was heavy and severe I really thought I was through the worst of it after all the phone calls and confrontations and realizing how many friends I never had Then our mutual friend died suddenly He had dropped me when she dropped me and he told me that we never had a falling out he was sorry it was just "Alex" He had talked of reaching out to me again weeks before he died It hit me pretty hard that he was gone I always thought we would reconnect as we had just clicked and it took me by surprise that hed dump me just because she did and he didnt want to go against her - shit look what happened when I did! I realized "Alex" was a fake friend when she refused to help me after surgery Also when she blackballed me with our mutual friends But most of all when she didnt tell me he died I found out from an acquaintance months after the fact He didnt have family in our state so she has decided to control the narrative on how he died and what lead up to it - other mutual friends did the hard work of moving his belongings out of his apartment and shipping them to family across the country Other friends are the ones who called the police for a welfare check when they couldnt reach him for days not her Shes just pulling the strings and having others do all the work for his memorial and she refuses to tell anyone how he died or the circumstances surrounding his death - most likely because it is speculated it was suicide after a period of deep depression How would it look for her "image" if people asked her how long he was depressed or was he seeking therapy - she didnt have a clue and didnt know he was unreachable and refused to help clearing his apartment with the police welfare check or even at the very least informing people of his death She has instructed other friends to send out a FB invite for his memorial but hasnt given them peoples email addresses - there are many of us finding out months later that hes gone we dont know what happened and she is withholding the information for her own reasons and denying us all closure I heard through the grapevine that I can come to the memorial - she has graced me with permission and has said she is open to talking to me again After years of repeated slights jabs lies and pain; it brings me great peace to say "NO THANK YOU" to her oh-so generous offer of "friendship" after everything she put me through No No thank you After the horrific way she has dealt with his death those old mutual friends are reaching out and saying they were wrong to believe her and dump me especially if she trashed her best friend like that how would she treat them? One said they were proud of me for leaving my abusive relationship with "Alex" and another said that "Alex" considered me as a minion not a friend I was blind to her narcissism for 20 years and couldnt see behind her mask Now everyone trying to grieve and get closure sees the real "Alex"and she is not pretty New rule: if you are the reason your friends cant talk to each other then it is your job to inform them when one of them dies AND you are required to be honest about the circumstances too What an asshole,NuclearTurmeric,16256238380,2

h0rgk9s,nt3y49,Choking! I think lots of people who wouldnt consider themselves particularly kinky or particularly sexually extreme will put a hand completely a partners mouth or on their throat The foremost experts on this subject a former EMT legal scholar and a marital artist lays out convincing arguments that those acts a)can cause unanticipatable death within seconds no matter the technique because of the parasympathetic nervous system and the valsalva effect b) most judges and juries hand down harsh penalties for people who harm or kill partners through choking in sex because it has zero perceived benefit to society or the individuals well being and c) that arguments about the documented safety of chokeholds in martial arts contexts (and lays out his reasoning that this also applies to things like gas masks devices techniques for "safer" choking) doesnt apply to sexual choking This is a honker of a read but I think everyone who wants to engage in or defend choking/suffocating a partner during sex or defend it should read it first I found it very well reasoned and convincing Or tl;dr a little light choking of your girlfriend can result in much more death and much more prison time than you would have imagined http://wwwjaywisemancom/SEX_BDSM_Breath_Closing_Argumenthtml,AbaloneHo,16229537920,2

gy4q2vl,nc8fis,Because a bad day isnt an excuse to threaten or attempt to murder assault or imply some sort of harm to someone because youre not getting your way Ive never once had to drop an N-bomb or start wailing about trans people in a bathroom or ANYTHING even on bad days like my dog dying my parents dying etc Its your job as an adult human being to not melt down like a toddler throwing a tantrum You need to learn to deal with disappointment and sorrow and grief and annoyance and even hatred And in a way that doesnt just vomit those feelings as violence on people you see as "below" you So I dont care if you just got your dick chopped off by a transvestite prostitute wielding an electric chainsaw with a weak battery that doesnt mean you get to do whatever you want because of your own fucked up situation We film because most people have not learned how to be adults This includes millennials but also baby boomers and everyone in-between Its not an age problem its a "half of all people are of below-average intelligence" problem We also film because we have seen what happens when you dont film Its he-said vs she-said Film is irrefutable You can say "hes just making that up" if theres no video But if you catch someone say coughing on cancer patients without a mask in stores to protest mask wearing and you film it thats undeniable accountability Its something this society hasnt ever had and were still struggling to adapt,old_man_snowflake,16210178260,1
gy4rjqh,nc8fis,I mean this seems like a really snarkily worded question as if we all know exactly why whatevers happening is happening Ive never filmed anyone in public but if it was a situation where someone was being antagonized or abused or whatever I would film it Not to upload to Reddit but to provide proof of what happened if its needed If I can help someone not be wrongfully accused of something I will I guess it sucks if someones having a bad day but its their fault for taking it out on others We hopefully learn not to do this when were children and in some cases there needs to be consequences for that behavior That said I wouldnt just record and bounce if I could help it and I definitely wouldnt upload it to the internet unless it was an antimasker or a sovereign citizen or something,sam_hammich,16210184670,1

guc0ag4,mpnsdn,My husband was trying to play the nice guy when we met Invited me to a party at his house I never went to (There wasnt a party but he made his roommates have one because he told me there would be one) Anyways after a few weeks of heavily perusing me and me dodging his every attempt we found our way on MSN one night while he was drunk and staying at some greasy hostel The convo went something like this : "Why dont we go go-carting sometime?" "Maybe but its not really my thing" "Ok well how bout I take you out when Im back in town?" "Ill see what Im doing Message me when youre back To be honest Im not really dating rn" "I call bullshit" "" "Why cant you fucking just come to dinner with me? You literally dont have to do anything but show up and you get a free fucking meal out of it!" Me shocked (Meh he had a point) "K fine lol See you wed night" He never remembered we had this conversation (Remember the drunk part) Wed came I didnt even get a message I didnt even want to go till I realized I was hearing crickets I ended up calling him out and he felt AWFUL He started desperately apologizing I being socially awkward and 20 was totally relieved But since I was all dressed up and had worked myself up for hanging out with this dude I ended up going to his house to (Netflix and chill circa 2009) We smoked a bunch of bowls in his basement while his buds were upstairs using their "real" TV So we watched "Halloween II" and "The Mask" on VHS passed out at his house and Weve been together for 125 years We have 2 kids and we game together all the time Edited for grammar*,RubyRuby_Soho,16182846490,4
gud2vzx,mpnsdn,A heated debate about PS3 vs XBox 360 (his argument was innovation mine was backward compatibility I did end up with a PS3 eventually) The kicker is that I totally tried to get with him (and like Im fairly blunt) and he never seemed down so I moved on Come to find out later that he was pining and moping to mutual dude friends over me without picking up on my pretty non-coded signals And like they had really tried to get him up to speed on the sitch too The moral here is to be on the lookout for the people who are ALREADY trying to get with you And since my friends and I regularly talked about how sweet and sexy this dude was it may be more people than you think Im not saying assume everyone wants to bang you Im saying get out of your own head a little and actually be aware of whats happening around you without your own (often destructive) inner monologue Get in the moment Post writing edit: This ended up being kind of long but heres my take as a formerly fat lady gamer recently diagnosed with ADHD and suspected autism who studied theater as a job social interactions as if it WERE my job and is a pro-level masker And whos also got a decent body count and is happily married now: The sexy things from a fat gamer are the same things that non plus-size (and on rare occasions non-gamer) dudes have told me But its not a specific secret password that unlocks sex/attraction When a person is confident funny and interesting and make me feel confident funny and interesting - that creates a joyful chemistry that I naturally want to take to the next level That next level is shared tenderness and vulnerability btw After that sex becomes the physical roll up of all those good feelings Do your part to create a happiness positive feedback loop After that youve got a very solid stack for a relationship if everyones into it Heres the thing: Potential partners arent looking for reasons NOT to bang you I know and have known far more sexy overweight short dudes who I can wax poetic about Fallout 3 with than sexy cut tall dudes Like by several country miles But Ill say this with all the remaining associated hang ups of being fat: I realized pretty quickly that I wasnt going to be everybodys cup of tea and thankfully had a chained epiphany that I didnt want someone who wouldnt choose me AND that I wanted someone (whether for an evening or a lifetime) who would make me feel good about myself and that I could return that energy to I think a lot of people disregard kindness or confuse it with nice when practicing their bonding stack Thats where the "nice guy" gets such a deservedly bad rap Whether youre looking for a one night stand or a relationship always be simultaneously be looking for a friend I remain very close with my top three partners (married to one of them) and even though the romantic/sexual aspect faded away with the other two I still love them They continue to add joy to my life Their happy marriages make me happy and I know mine does the same for them See how that feedback loop hangs on throughout the relationship? Isnt that beautiful? Bonus advice! This comes down to the kindness quotient - Dont yuck their yum Dont settle for someone who yucks your yum Good-natured teasing is one thing but most people are VERY BAD at that Unless youre absolutely positive that youre particularly skilled at that VERY COMPLICATED AND NUANCED social gambit dont do it The amount of people who readily admit that theyre lacking in social/emotional acumen but think they can speed run to the "being mean in a nice way" level is staggering If thats the only kind of clever banter that can be come up with its a North America-sized red flag It doesnt feel good Dont fall into the PUA trap of withholding good and turning it into a scarcity complex Thats abuse We shouldnt be judging people for what makes them happy we should be taking an interest in their happiness and actively trying to increase it Whether or not youre going to bump uglies because to look at it in a more calculated fashion all of their friends are also watching you And women talk Good luck out there!

Thats not to say that that is how all female trump supporters feel or that stay-at-home moms or wives or whatever actually feel that way yall are bad ass But there are women out there that fundamentally believe this And if you dont believe this and support trump then my next question is: how can you support a person who is completely willing to use you abuse you and thinks its funny to grab you by the pussy? Politics aside how can you support a man like this to represent our country? Furthermore how can you support a person who openly lies to your face? His term has passed but I have a customer who is perfectly nice and is a carpenter for a living But she still flies trump flags and wears a trump mask that says "f*** your feelings" And sure I may be a person with a lot of feelings but I just genuinely do not understand it,Bitch1919,16191256620,2

To which the DM replied "Why not" The player then proceeded to wear the mask and go to the local barracks where the cult leader worked and while wearing the face of their friends dead wife asks for child support from the town since her husband died while in service The DM then shoots him one of these faces :I before saying "roll a charisma die youre gonna need a good one" Needless to say this mother fucker gets a nat 20 and now receives child support once a month upon returning to that village,hazza987,16230950590,36

"Walking Its cold so I needed to cover up Im literally out here every night" He goes on to tell me thats a good way to get shot and I probably should get a gym membership instead Needless to say I got a gym membership the next day,Rocky_Rockford,16265645330,10
h5jy73r,olspwd,I go for two thirty minutes walks between the hours of 12 and 4 am every night and have for years I live in a decent UK suburb full of semi detached houses and old people Not the most dangerous place lmao But on one side there is a council estate and on the other a rather vast woodland These are where Ive had a few experiences One was a few months ago I was walking through a path in the woods leading back to my residential area in the dead of night It was completely black everywhere except for what was illuminated by my phone torch A person walked past me heading back into the woods wearing all black and a mask that covered his entire face It wasnt a normal mask youd see during the pandemic none of his face was visible at all I am 100% sure because I pointed my torch right at him He walked in an almost robotic manner and his head stayed straight without flinching at all Nothing happened to me but it was really odd Another was when I bumped into someone on a street corner in the council estate who had recently got out of jail for killing someone He beckoned me over to his group who were drinking I did because I have intense anxiety and didnt want to be seen ignoring him Turns out he was pretty sound though gave me a few cans of beer and was all round really nice and friendly Offered to sell me weed and I said no and left The scariest one was a few weeks ago This occurred on the main road that runs between my area and the council estate I joined up to the main road whilst smoking a joint and I saw a guy standing still on the street corner Normal but I did wonder what he was doing there at around 3am especially considering he wasnt even using his phone to anything just standing doing nothing Again Im awkward and anxious so I crossed to the other side of the road as to not have to walk directly past him Upon doing so I noticed he did the same following around 10 feet behind me I kept walking I then crossed back to the other side as to avoid him and I noticed he did the same again He was around 10 feet behind me this entire time matching my movements I crossed back over again and he also did the same Hed now followed 3 of my crosses which is what convinced me that it was beyond a coincidence I was definitely being followed The oddest part of it all is that I was getting faster the whole time By the end I was almost in a jog But he maintained the same distance In retrospect I assume he was just waiting for a drug dealer he was unfamiliar with and thought it was me Maybe he thought he was to follow me into a less public area I think this is more likely than him having sinister intentions Im sure Ive had some other scary things happen My memory is terrible I doubt this will get any attention but Ill try remember if it does My walks tonight are gonna hit different after reading this thread lol oh also side note none of this is fake or embellished You can check my profile I never answer these threads or tell any stories this is my first opportunity to write about an experience of mine lol Also fox noises are scarier than all of this combined Near enough shit my pants every time because their range of sounds is so huge and so human,cryforabsolution,16265544950,6

h5jrsgt,olspwd,I was walking back to my hotel while traveling in Colombia in what I thought was a safe neighborhood and maybe about a block or two from the police station I got that feeling when someones staring at you and instinctively turned to look over my right shoulder to see a guy about 15 feet up the road wearing a hoodie and mask At this point my adrenaline slams the gas peddle and my mind is racing "The guy is like a small build (57-58 and 160lbs) relative to me (6ft 250lbs with decent muscle which means hes either got a weapon or friends" For a few seconds I get ready to have to fight but then remember my stepfathers advice to always run if you can as nothing is worth risking life I calm myself and reach for my phone to get ready to give it the guy when all of a sudden I hear footsteps quickly coming at me and its the man demanding for me to give him everything with a giant chefs(?) knife Unfortunately I threw my phone at him in a panic and it hit him on the chest He got angry and tried to slash me twice I dont know but I managed to lunge out of the way and say in my broken Spanish that thats all I have and to just take it He was saying something but between the panic and the mask covering his face I couldnt understand or register (now I realize he wanted my wallet-duh) so I just ran like my life depended on it I didnt look back for a good 100 yards or so and by then he was gone Looking back I shouldve have just given him my phone and wallet It was so easy to lock to my iPhone and in my wallet I had a few credit cards that I could easily lock and barely any cash (maybe $40),Hot-Boysenberry4591,16265512510,4

Something like that and I opened the house and ran up the stairs to my room we have 3 floors i am on the 2nd floor Didnt even bother to turn on the lights Just ran as if I saw a murderer well probably wouldnt have ran like that if I saw a murderer lol After that I told a friend that was at the party with me (we live in a small town) and what he told me just fucking infuriated me I wanted to kill him The same friend that I wanted to give the knife to the one who was the organizer of the party had sent one the guys at the party to follow me and scare the shit out of me I forgot it was April fools and I didnt talk to him for a month lol,Pupica2007,16265568990,3

I was still used to having to deal with curfew and felt like I was doing something wrong just being out so late on foot It was also so unusual and sudden I asked him to repeat himself So he yells the same thing again After looking confused I yelled "No sorry" and he floors it and turns the corner The second he floored it everything clicked and my jaw hit the floor As I lose sight of the cop it clicked that this Jason imposter might have seen me talking to the cops and I was probably the only person he saw It was one of the longest walks home in my life I have never looked back more than that night,Cujomenge,16264967120,1

STOP? WHY?"

h8h0mt2,p1f1gn,Im typing this while angry at this man who has passed 40 +yrs ago but I will say this once and I will say it again Hans Aspergers!! That man deserved his spot in hell for what he did to those on the spectrum (like me with PDD NOS) For those who dont know who he was Hans Aspergers was an Austrian pediatrician was said to have discovered Specific ASDs (autism spectrum disorder and had one named after him) and was falsely deemed a hero for years for saving children from Nazi killing programme He actually was involved of the killing of children (he deemed to be unintelligent) with disabilities and encouraged therapies to bring these intelligent children back to normalcy that were often cruel and unusual This led to many therapies and treatments for those on the spectrum to be set on turning these people normal to live in our society as well as ableism and cruel treatments to be normalized The foundational ideas of autism emerged in a society that strove for the opposite of diversity and encouraging neurodivergent people to be themselves Theres more that he did but as someone whose about to graduate college with a teaching degree what Hans did to those children will never leave my mind He reinforced ablest ideals to the point where they came the norm Its the ideals that many "fake" autism support groups encourage It makes me sick I will always treat my students with fairness regardless of what is happening in their lives or conditions they have Masking shouldnt be the normal or encouraged (unless your safety is compromised),AriessunTaurusmoon44,16286386250,2

h8fmfr8,p1f1gn,Someone had already stated my original answer of Andrew Wakefield eloquently enough I am going to go with another more recent person Donald J Trump 45th President of the United States of America This isnt going to be a statement on his awful economic policy driving up the national debt while making the rich richer or his responsibility for the rise in explicit xenophobia and white nationalism This is in response to his action and inaction to the COVID-19 pandemic He received information in late January of the worry of a new very infectious virus appearing i Wuhan China He sat on this information and chose not to disseminate it to the public for fears the apprehension would tank the stock market Trump had for the entirety of his Presidency equated the stock market to his economic success He also made no effort to rebuild the emergency supplies that were depleted during the Swine Flu epidemic As cases appeared in the US in March and early April He public downplayed the virus saying the US cases would be zero symptoms were not much worst than the flu and that the virus would diminish with heat Again he privately was receiving information that COVID-19 was more contagious and more severe than the flu He chose again to sit on the information because he knew that it would drastically effect the stock market By May as many cities were being hit he formed a task force this task force specifically chose not to act in aide because at the time the most impacted cities were the densely populated Democratically run cities As experts were asking for mitigation efforts like masking social distancing and remote learning Trump politicized the issue He refused to acknowledge how masks would help intentionally made sure photo ops of him were without a mask because he felt it made him look weak propagated the narrative that only those who are afraid are wearing masks and intentionally fought against remote learning because he knew it would take some individuals out of the workforce potentially hurting the economy He talked up BS treatments of COVID including the malaria and RI drug hydroxychloroquine This created a large run on the drug as hospitals scrambled to get product just in case disrupting the supply chain and hurting patients who needed the meds Hydroxychloriquine was subsequently found to have no effect on COVID treatment After he tested positive for COVID he continues to downplay his symptoms despite needing to be flown by helicopter to Walter Reed because his oxygen dropped to concerning level While at Walter Reed he received the experimental monoclonal antibody treatment Regeneron which reduced symptoms but was not available to the public After this treatment he continued to downplay COVID seriousness and masks making a huge show of removing his when returning from Walter Reed Despite pushing the vaccine as a huge accomplishment when in office after he lost the election he made no significant statement towards recommending the vaccine This would have gone a long way to convincing his supporters it was the right thing to do It is also despite being vaccinated himself Seizing on to Trump fervent fan base and the already politicized mask issue many Republican Governors have now banned mask mandates in their state With mitigation efforts being thrown out vaccine hesitancy and the delta variant our hospital systems are once again being taxed This time however it is effecting the unvaccinated and the young more heavily Thousands of children have been hospitalized so far from the delta variant Over 600k Americans have died from COVID-19 Trump decisions during the early stages of the pandemic politicized mitigation efforts that could have prevented a majority of those deaths The death toll is still rising as over 700 Americans are dying daily and that rate is steadily increasing,DelirousDoc,16286166710,2

h8fl4mj,p1f1gn,Im going to say Donald Trump Heres why Trump didnt cause COVID-19 but he is directly and 100% culpable for all of the idiots across the entire world trying to pretend its not a thing If there was no Trump this would have still happened but nobody would have thought twice about taking a vaccine or masking up Thus hes directly responsible for severely debilitating the entire world economy The real key for why I think this is the most damaging thing any single person is responsible for in history is because it happened *today* For most of human history we didnt actually advance all that much Pick any random human over the course of history and their life was likely damn near identical to their great grandparents lives That changed with the industrial revolution Ever since we havent simply been progressing quickly the *rate* of progress has been growing as well In essence the modern progression of humanity is similar to compound interest Lets say youve got $100 If you invest it in an account that gives 10% today that means in 5 years youve got $161 and in 10 years youve got $259 If instead you wait and start investing *next* year then 5 years from today youd have $146 and in 10 years youd have $235 So from skipping one year of interest youre $15 poorer in 5 years and $24 poorer in 10 years And that deficit is just going to keep getting larger and larger over time And thus because of the setbacks of COVID-19 the gulf between where humanity *is* and where we *should have been* is going to just keep getting wider and wider as time goes on,Asmor,16286161270,0

hszgspk,s5m4up,School board has announced a public meeting to discuss switching from 5-day to 4-day per week school there is already one "teacher work day" per month (either a Friday or a Monday connected to a holiday) where there is no school Rich parents think its going to lower property taxes --- it will not because the school board will just find another place to spend the money (like the fancy baseball stadium and sports complex lighting they just added) Poor parents think its going to break them to have to arrange child care for 3-4 additional days per month -- it likely willthere is no infrastructure for it Grandparents are worried that 40% of the school kids qualify for free or reduced lunches and that means that those kids will miss two meals per day for 3-4 days more per month The "buddy pack" weekend food bank program is not prepared to add an additional days worth of food for the kids receiving the backpacks Students think theyll get 3-4 more days a month to play --- theyll really have 3-4 weeks per month where learning is squeezed into less classroom time and there will be fewer class-units per semester so fewer electives for the high schoolers Teachers know theyll get screwed either way --- just because the kids arent in the classroom doesnt mean the administration wont require them to be in classroom doing other tasks including deep-cleaning their own classrooms to prohibit the spread of covid The same classroom where they are legally prevented from enforcing a mask mandate The lunch ladies dont give a shit because theyve already contracted out feeding the kids and none of the food is prepared locally --- just dished out by increasingly bitter part-time-working retirees The bus drivers are the only ones who will "win" except theyll have to pick up another side gig to off set the loss of 6 hours of minimum wage work per week The good news? Both faith-based schools in town have announced that they will continue to schedule all classes 5 days per week and our state legislature wont let go of opportunities to vote in school vouchers that will take money from public schools and give it to the faith-based private schools Prior to this debate/debacle and covid the school districts standardized test scores were higher for a five-year average than theyve ever been ---- kids were actually being educated and going to college and trade schools instead of McDs or the factory I guess they figured it was time to dumb-down the populace again and start with the next generation of voters,Lybychick,16423856160,28

hplfa7c,rm3qcl,This is a follow up to my original post about my middle school teacher This one happened in my 2nd year of high school I had transferred over to a new high school after an incident happened and had to get adjusted to new teachers and kids In my history class The teacher was all right he wasnt the best but he wasnt the worse The kids in that class however were awful They were constantly heckling and messing with him they were constantly getting on his nerves and they kept pushing the envelope every class At 1 point the teacher had enough and we did not see him for the rest of that school year We found out that he had had a mental breakdown and I didnt see him again until late junior/early senior year This school I went to was also notorious for kids breaking shit The bathrooms were always messed up any new equipment any classes/buildings got would get ruined within weeks the books were trashed etc On day Im leaving campus with my then girlfriend and we hear the fire alarm go off but dont think much of it because it was a regular thing to happen since kids kept pulling it Turns out it was serious cause the next day all bathrooms were monitored and some locked It was cause a kid decided itd be funny to light the fucking trash ablaze,MaskedMajora217,16402024040,3

hpmcu1f,rm3qcl,We used to tease one of the kids in our year Always did I dont think it ever got to the point of actual bullying seeings as there was no malicious intent aside from a small handful of people who were bullies He was different and easy to get a ride out of We knew to a degree he was autistic but it was something we all forgot about because he wasnt the autistic kid he was just Declan whos funny when he gets mad at you for calling Star Wars Star Trek I would also tease him but then other times Id be good friends with him so I think the very mixed signals fucked with him a lot He also had a crush on me at some point which I hate to admit I was a little mean about (though I did apologise for that behind closed doors with some sort of Im just following the crowd sort of explanation) It was so normal back then and we all just saw it as banter but now I feel really bad for him looking back I was such an awful person in year 7-8 and Im disgusted in the way I treated some people him included Id love to get in touch with him and apologise properly and to also explain that I now know Im autistic too which is why we got along so well why I wasnt pretending and aggressively masking in front of everyone else But unfortunately I moved away in year 10 and when I recently spoke to an old friend I asked if they knew his number Instagram etc and apparently he has no social media and nobody ever got his number :( if somehow you see this Declan I hope youre doing well and still rocking the guitar!,PirateOfTheStyx,16402165460,2
hpkm98s,rm3qcl,Not high school but middle school Had a friend try the "classic" pull the chair out from under someone as they go to sit prank The kid landed in just the worst way and his lower back got fucked up Everyone thought it was funny for approximately 30 seconds then he didnt stand up Ambulance had to be called my friend was suspended and the school had to talk the parents down from filing a suit (I assume against the school and maybe my friends parents given that everyone actually involved in the incident was like 12) And yet people still kept trying to pull this prank Now this one was high school but not a classmate We had a teacher who would annually "prank" his home room around Halloween by running into the class in a mask with a (chain-less) chainsaw Usually just meant the class would jump a bit then have a chuckle but my sophomore year one kid went full fight or flight jumped out of his desk and fell into a grouping of desks/students fracturing parts of his leg and hip (iirc) He had just tried out and made the football team was big into the other athletics too and was hoping to use that to propel him to a scholarship Spent a few months on crutches and a couple years in physical therapy any hopes of high school sports pretty much smashed Teacher and school administrators got sued but the students were pretty split (some saying the teacher was just trying to have fun and shouldnt be blamed for the kids reaction) The school settled with the family my senior year undisclosed payout but the teacher wasnt fired Last I heard the teacher resigned abruptly and fled town when a female student came out claiming he had propositioned her,CThayer1996,16401906910,1

She said I should sign up online So I did They had open appointments so I scheduled one for 10 am The mask mandate had just been lifted but I still wore one because I figured itd be required Showed up and over and over I was asked ;"did u fill out the rapid pass?" No idk what rapid pass even is  Waited and waited probably an hour People that were arriving early were being told they couldnt wait inside They had a device that looked like a kindle that you looked into and took ur temperature It was set pretty high up most of the potential donors were too short for it to work One of the volunteers adjusted it and another woman came over and really bitchily said " pleeeeeeeeease dont touch that only I am authorized" After over an hour the same bitchy woman called me back to her area and I gave her my info Im at about the 1 hr 15 mark by now "You didnt do the Rapid pass?!!" I peeled off the little sticker I had saying I was a donor and told her I didnt realize what a bureaucracy their organization was and Id come back sometime when I had 6 or 7 hrs After researching online I found that my experience was far from the exception When I later saw my friend she said they turned her away I guess they already had enough of her blood type Nothing worse than trying to do something altruistic and it turns into an ordeal Never again,Plenty-Object1853,16270515190,54

hdrblvq,psin9a,I had a baby right before the pandemic hit mid 2019 She doesnt know a world where people arent wearing masks When we go outside she tries to put one on even if we are just going to the mailbox She has never been to the park the beach the mountains the zoo the aquarium shes almost never seen another baby in her life except on screens shes never seen a restaurant or a shopping mall we had to cancel every trip every vacation every birthday party for the last year and a half we even had to cancel our trip to Disney that we had been saving up for since I got pregnant with her I cant even take her shopping because people here refuse to mask up (AL) and every day her older brother goes to school theres a risk he will bring covid home (hes too young for the vaccine) and if my kids get it I dont want to think about it The schools are under reporting covid cases theyre not mandating anything to prevent the spread and theyre not offering *any* sort of virtual or hybrid classes to deal with this Oh and my husbands mental health has taken a massive hit since he got laid off in 2020 He was suicidal a few months ago which was fucking scary Also I lost 3 loved ones last year and I may as well have told people my fish had died My brother in law died in November and my managers were thumbing through manuals before I even finished my sentence to see if I should be allowed off to attend the funeral Thankfully it was on my day off But still how fucked is that that your employer can tell you which family members are worth a day or two of bereavement and which ones arent? This shit has been going on so long that I feel like *everyone* is suffering from compassion fatigue Twenty years ago we collectively stopped everything and mourned over 2000 people who were killed in a single day during the world trade center attacks But that number is every day now and we are too burnt out to even acknowledge it After 18 months we hear the numbers on the news we sigh and we get back to work The callousness of it all is overwhelming Youve got millions dropping like flies and we are all just going about our business like its a regular Tuesday And theres no compassion for those who are struggling Even with the vaccine coming out nothing has really improved our situation because not nearly enough people are taking it We have needed help for so long this has been an emergency for *so long* that the alarm bells that have been going off for 18 months have become white noise in the background of society You cant even get done reading one tragic article before another one is published with an even worse tragedy "the virus is killing people!" "Child abuse cases skyrocket!" "Someone did another mass shooting in a shopping mall!" "Hey look the virus mutated *again* and *this* strain makes your eyeballs melt and your tongue swell to the size of a grapefruit!" "Were running out of food! Were running out of clean water!" "Homelessness is at an all time high!" "Look how this natural disaster fucked up this area!" "Rent is going up and the minimum wage still hasnt budged!" And of course: "Climate change will take us all out very soon but *what about the economy?*" Its like we are all working in a burning building and management is telling everyone to stay calm and keep working and half of the company is yelling "are you crazy? Put the fucking fire out youre gonna get us all killed!" And the other half is yelling "the fuck? We cant stop *everything* just to put the fire out do you know what that would do to our production schedule?!" And then management is saying "ughh if youre SO concerned with the "fire" then just keep a fire extinguisher on your person" And then youve got half the employees saying "I have a fire extinguisher and a big bucket of water but WE SHOULD REALLY PUT OUT THE FIRE" and then youve got the other half saying "you cant make me tote around a fire extinguisher all day! I have rights!" But then the fire gets on THEM and they start spreading it around more and begging for the fire extinguisher but its too late,SourBlue1992,16322543020,311

hdst40v,psin9a,Collateral damage We talk a lot about people who die OF covid but not much about the people who have died BECAUSE OF covid My husband died because of covid not from it He had been battling colon cancer for almost 4 years when covid hit They had removed part of his colon and did radiation and chemo and was fine but it ended up going to his lungs However the plan was to use what they call cyber knife to attack any of the nodes in his lungs that started growing One of them started growing and they did three of these super targeted radiation treatments on the node and it didnt exactly get rid of it but it shrunk remarkably in size and stopped growing entirely None of the other nodes showed much in the way of growth so the plan was to do CT scans every 2-3 months to check on growth and if any of them started growing they would attack it with the cyber knife All was going well then covid hit He became too afraid to leave the house and go to the hospital for the CT scans I knew his immunity was compromised so I was the only one that went out and I wore masks limited my time out and everything was disinfected before it came into the house His oncologist cancelled his appointments but he was free to call if he needed anything Everything was fine at first but by May of 2020 he started coughing He would occasionally cough up blood but he refused to go to the hospital or doctor He got to the point where he would cough so hard he would gag then throw up anything he had eaten He was getting weaker and weaker Finally in August he was feeling so bad I finally convinced him to go to the ER They did a CT scan and told us to contact Hospice He died August 25 2020 I am sure many people with health issues did the same thing Put off healthcare for fear of contracting covid only to have their other health issues spiral out of control I know my husband was going to die eventually but I have the feeling if it hadnt have been for covid he would have lasted another year or two,anamoirae,16322789310,77
hdqbjgi,psin9a,It will be decades until the effects on the psychology and economic chances of current children come to light In some countries children missed 2 school years with only barebone online and TV options to catch up Children have been growing up with constant warning to not get too close to other people sanitize everything and wear masks Do they learn how to read a strangers mimic? Do they focus on the eyes instead of the whole face?

hdpxlwr,psin9a,As an ICU RT I have had the unfortunate privilege of watching COVID pts literally lose their minds and try to kill themselves Typically while having to wear bipaps for extended periods of time Some literally rip the masks off and scream like animals while writhing in their beds Others rip them off and say how much better they feel even though their O2 saturation percentage drops like a stone down into the 20s and 30s (normal is around 95% to 97% but with COVID were lucky to keep them at 88%) They literally fight us to put it back on By this point the only option left is intubation and being put on a vent which they will probably die on It only happens to maybe 1 out of every 15 pts that wind up in the ICU with COVID needing high levels of supplemental O2 Its completely insane (in my book anyway) and yet most people dont know about it,cold_art_cannon,16322336630,1886

The endless 12-hour workdays? Being forced back into schools without mask or vaccination mandates for slashed pay and benefits?

hdsiwhn,psin9a,Delayed or ignored justice State Attorneys Generals offices are overwhelmed HUD is overwhelmed Police and social services are overwhelmed Lawyers are overwhelmed Courts are slammed if theyve even reopened I experienced traumatizing situations at my last workplace where I was a temp in the months running up to the first Covid shutdown Extremely traumatic sexual harassment by a full-time employee threats by another full-time employee heavy surveillance a lot of punching down by other full-timers and HR was the worst bully of all They ignored all of our states covid protocols and I was teased and harassed when I took them seriously and remained 6 feet from my team/wore a mask I fell into a very deep depression I couldnt find a therapist and didnt even have private space in my apartment to do online sessions if I had So I did Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation instead because thats all I could get The TMS center was basically a massive for-profit insurance scam The staff were very manipulative which was difficult for me to figure out in my depressed state The treatment caused a psychotic episode When I asked the staff they said there was no way it could be the treatment I was so scared and confused Legally and ethically they should have shut down my treatment But they treated me like I was "being dramatic" and the nurse practitioner prescribed me an energy work podcast I was still driving I could have hurt myself or others Months later I discovered that TMS can cause manias and centers are warned about this when they buy the machines I also discovered that they were breaking multiple state laws including their treatment of children for autism spectrum - which isnt medically sound or approved - and advertising it which is definitely against the law Then I moved into a slumlord property where they had lied to me about the apartment it wasnt safe it had black mold it violated a ton of laws In all three of these horrible situations Ive tried to reach out to my state attorneys general to therapists to lawyers via my countys bar association oversight orgs the press Everyones too busy or dont care All of the responses I get are kind of half-ass or auto-messages The traumas themselves make me feel like I have an invisible hand over my mouth and a chokehold on my brain I struggle to find the words and to even talk about it Everything just shuts down Trying push through it and report it all and get help over and over to no response its exhausting and so awful The whole thing has made me feel so worthless and hopeless My SO has noticed how different I am ("angry all the time" "sad all the time") and they think I have ptsd I dont trust doctors anymore I dont trust people not to manipulate me or take advantage of me I have a lot of anxiety about finding a new job made worse by the time gap and lack of references Legally speaking I think too much time has passed to actually get any justice I dont feel like I can tell anyone I know because I just hear "why dont/didnt you get a lawyer/therapist/tell someone/report it to X/why did you wait so long?" I think this is what people say to feel like theyre being nice or dont know what to say They have this nave blind trust in "the system" and in "justice" It hurts though because I tried so many times to so many different people - the people you go to and got nothing These are people who have never been there or maybe they have the privilege of access to a good lawyer The trauma of the unavailability of justice is possibly more traumatizing than the incidents of trauma Im trying to get justice from I feel like Im the figure in [The Scream](https://enwikipediaorg/wiki/The_Scream) This is a time and environment in which scammers and criminals and crooks and bullies and abusers thrive It scares me what horrors others must be experiencing and the emptiness they must be experiencing if they also have tried to get help (Edit: and the dealership tried to scam me when I brought in my car for maintenance and Im pretty sure my dentist dermatologist and my sleep specialist intentionally overprescribed over-treated and over-tested me (but I cant trust that Im not just paranoid?) all of which would have been a bigger deal to me before Covid At this point I feel manipulated into submission) Edit II: Thank you to everyone who read this and upvoted That someone took the time to read this it actually does mean a lot to me I feel heard and validated Maybe Im not "insane" but the situation it "Hell is a place with no reason" Thank you for making me feel like Im reasonable I wish we (and everyone else who added on this post) could meet up for a really good soda or lunch or ice cream (virgin because of the number of folks reporting their self-medication struggles This post is proof of how desperately we all need each other Alone together together alone I hope we learn how to be better at connecting than we were even before the pandemic,SnooDonuts8963,16322739490,6

hdqz2g3,psin9a,general empathy towards others seems to be running low for a lot of folks which is somewhat depressing like I think the writing was on the wall early on in the pandemic when we saw people refuse masks and social distancing - lots of people were going to expose themselves and the people around them to COVID this was cemented when people decided that the vaccine was also a matter of debate now? well a few years ago I fucking couldnt **ever** imagine that a community like /r/HermanCainAward would or *should* exist but well I understand that it does people have been trying to get folks on board with things like "science" and "stopping all this needless death" for more than a year now and people are just tapped out on giving a fuck again its sad to see but I cant deny that theres a lot of legitimate emotion behind it Im in the Midwest and was talking to a friend about HCA - she said she couldnt bring herself to read any of those stories because they show off almost exactly the same Facebook feed as the ones her family keeps its insane that so many of these people are dying of COVID - all they leave behind are deathly ironic Facebook memes and a grieving family its just strange that weve had to become normalized to this shit,extralyfe,16322491440,2

h9gupwl,p6qb47,This ones a bit tough to write out buried the memory in my Lockbox in my head Happened about 15- 16 years ago was about 14 years old my dad got a new girlfriend who was super adventurous & highly illogical We had a family beach house that we shared with our cousins - 3 hours from our hometown But she didnt like it So naturally she finds a new one Which is a 75 hour drive away on shitty African roads Being a teenager I had no choice but to go a long with it & my dad had bought a new van since she had 2 kids & easiest way to transport 5+ people I used to love getting my hands dirty with car stuff when I was younger & had taken the van around the corner to make sure the tyres pumped lug nuts tightenet water full oil etc I probably was more attentive to that car than I am to my own car today Anyways we leave at 5am Strangest thing though 2 of the lug nuts came flying off & we lose a bit of stability & hit a massive pot hole & tyre is wrecked We crawl to nearest 1 horse town find a spare tyre & new lug nuts & get the car in decent shape but the sun is going down now Great The roads pitch dark full of potholes sometimes floods & dangerous so we settle with going in the am My dad parks the car outside this motel & they get 2 rooms for the night I was on first night shift duty until midnight then he would swap with me We had all our stuff & it wasnt entirely safe to leave the car unattended Im pretty happy in the van Was super comfy & spacious & I had my phone & Gameboy Batteries in my Gameboy go out Brand new batteries too Strange So I start looking out the window at really nothing Roads dead & only light coming from other side of the car from the motel Africa doesnt do street Lights in the middle of nowhere But I see this guy sitting on a rock around this fire can see his siloutte but no face looks like he had a mask on & glowing red eyes I got uncomfortable looking but I couldnt look away Theres a tin toilet hut nearby Another guy exits the hut drops his cigarette into the fire & says something to him I saw them start arguing & he takes the guy down without much effort & grabs a rock & starts beating the cigarette guys head Now Im absolutely terrified I drop to the floor in case hes seen me I have 2 options Fight or flight I have my dads gun but Im not prepared to use it unless he comes to the car I feel my cellphone In the seat & text my sisters *& dad "SOS lets go" No signal Message wont send Fuck! I could exit from the other door but the lights in the motel room are off I hear knocking on the window & reach for the gun I packed it so I know where to find it Velcroed under seat of drivers seat Problem is I never leave the mag with the gun & I cant find the mag As the knocking gets louder I find the smaller spare mag chamber with 5 bullets loaded & slot it straight in ready to fire I look up to see my sisters peering into the car from the side of the strange red eyed man who was beating another guys head moments before Terrified for them I unlock the car & tell them to get in They see the fear in my eyes & the gun & start asking whats going on I point at where I saw the man No ones there Only thing left is the fire and stone he sat on This is where it gets weirder I dont say anything to them as Im not sure they would believe me So I play it off like I was trying to scare them My dads girlfriend though had a "feeling come over her" that something bad would happen if we stayed the night She insisted on getting everyone back into the car from the motel As we were getting ready to go 2 of the girls needed to wee so they went to the nearby tin toilet I walked them there to check the ground for blood but with the sand & wind & lack of light I didnt see much except the embers in the fire still going & the cigarette But They saw the man with the red eyes out the window on the other side of the toilet & screamed running back to the car We left at midnight on the dangerous dark (0 street lights) pothole ridden road due to her "bad feeling" I dont think I ever liked her more I couldnt sleep properly for weeks after & I eventually told my family a couples nights later what I saw The only one to believe me was my dads weird girlfriend,tdog701,16293292890,5

h9h5q4n,p6qb47,One night both my roommates werent home so I was alone in the house It was nothing unusual they both had girlfriends and often spent the night out That night I had the most vivid dream ever You know they say that you forget most of your dreams after you wake up? Well this dream felt so real that I still remember every detail of it today as if it actually happened Heres what happened in my dream: I woke up to a loud banging noise outside I got out of bed and went to the window to see what it was There I saw a man wearing a black mask banging on my neighbors glass sliding door He was holding one of those tactical knives the ones you see in movies He clearly looked like a burglar and was beyond suspicious I found it strange that he was not trying to be discreet at all Anyways I decided I would call the police However as I turned around to get my phone from my bedside table there he was the burglar suddenly in my house and standing in my bedroom doorway as if hed teleported there the instant I turned around from the window Before I could react he rushed at me with his tactical knife and cut my throat At first there was no pain or should I say that I was too shocked to feel any pain I clutched my throat with both hands and stumbled onto the bed There was blood everywhere I could feel it spilling out between my fingers I could feel it filling up my lungs and drowning me I could feel the warmth slowly leaving my body I supported myself with one hand on the bed to keep myself from falling backwards I could feel my hand sticking to the bed sheets as they were soaked with blood With the other hand still clutching my throat I looked at my attacker He just stood there watching me die staring at me straight in the eyes Then the pain hit me and I blacked out When I woke up I just lay there in my bed trying to process what happened in my dream trying to figure out which part of it was real Obviously there was no blood no cut on my throat and no masked man holding a knife It felt way too real to be a dream It felt more like a memory an experience that is hard to describe with words But it was definitely a dream and I will remember it for the rest of my life,sushizn,16293345020,1

When I asked him if he was allergic to bees and thats why he was so scared he said "Well no" I was so confused why somebody would react like that unless their life was in danger He kept doing weird shit like muttering to himself behind the closed door when he would use the bathroom snooping around my parents house without permission and opening the door to the basement apartment (which was occupied at the time) being horrifically awkward on social media and absolutely exploding with temper tantrums at work We dated for three weeks Two and a half of those was me trying to figure out how to break it off It was after he tried to initiate sex with me for like the sixth time (I refused every time for religious reasons and he had zero respect for my boundaries) He managed to get me out of my shirt that night and I started crying because I was NOT into it I felt so violated After I did break it off and blocked him on social media he found my email after I moved away and started dating a different guy about six months later He sent me an absolute brick of text that said nothing but "FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU" and made my scrolling finger sore He was an embarrassment of a human being,Eternity_Mask,16218761670,2
gzaxdv1,njrvgm,I was living with my ex up until a few months ago We met during a pretty confusing and painful time in my life not long after Id moved to Berlin in earl 2019 She seemed very sweet and very helpful when we met kind generous caring empathetic In early 2020 I had to go back to Australia (Im from Oz) for family reasons and got stuck there for 9 months due to C We did long distance and though I was dealing with a lot of family issues at the time we seemed to be doing well I got back to Berlin last November (2020) and the city has been heavily locked down ever since This lockdown was really hard on our relationship as my ex had lost her job couldnt be fucked with her uni had lost her grandma to C you know she was having a hard time The years end rolled around and we were having some small drinks with some friends over NYE My ex was nervous to be there which I thought was strange as shes met my friends a lot and my friends are very warm and welcoming people My ex ended up getting way too drunk and vomiting around 11pm so just before midnight struck we got out of there I was tired and happy to be gone and of course I had to take care of her We got back to her place and she started having a panic attack as soon as we walked in the door Ive supported friends through things like this before but this was something different She was erratic sobbing speaking gibberish it was really unsettling and went on for a couple of hours I tried to play it down to the difficulty of the year but it just felt so off For the following week she was like a completely different person She gave me cold nothing answers when I asked how she was doing kind of like an angry child She looked at me as though I was evil with so much hate and accusation in her eyes She started making spiteful little jokes about the fact that I was working too much (I do music work and have worked really fucking hard to get to where I am shouldnt she be happy that Im keeping my shit together throughout the pandemic?) She started blaming me for little things like when her pants would fall from where they were hanging or saying that I was saying things to be mean to her on purpose (all with this newfound venom in her face and voice that Id never seen or heard before) She started picking fights and accusing me of things like cheating (Ive never cheated before and never could Im far too loyal) This went on for a couple of weeks and scared the shit out of me (unfortunately Ive got a history of a few different forms of abuse in my childhood as well as adult life) I was so fucking confused Who was she? Who was this new person who seemed so off? Ive been trying to figure it all out ever since this started in January of this year and to be honest it feels like a nightmare which is similar to someone I used to live with and be friends with who gaslit me a lot and who I now know is a rapist/child molester - she with the way she was acting towards me reminded me of him As I began to confront her about what was happening she told me that she had been acting really cold and distant to me to see what I would do This really sent my head spinning Who was she then? Was she the person I fell in love with? All of a sudden other little things started to freak me out such as when she said that she would hold onto my stuff and care for it while I was in Australia so that I would come back to her or the joking ways she used to accuse me of cheating early in our relationship I thought all of these things were just jokes I dont know what really sealed the deal for me but the fear I felt in seeing how paranoid and willing to be sinister she was scared me as I couldnt fall back into the insanity of an abuser who tried to gaslight me I broke it off and moved out in a really dramatic fashion as I still dont know many people in Berlin and its really hard to find a room here Then after the breakup I tried to confront her and ask her why she had been so awful to me and why she would accuse me of cheating on her? As I said this she looked horrified as if I had accused her of some unfathomable crime and played innocent How could she ever say that? Would she really say that to me? Was I just making it up? She stuck to this hard I then felt the insanity of being gaslit that Ive felt a lot over the past 10 years due to this other person I was living with and it scared the fuck out of me As she said this I felt fucking terrified and I put my phone on voice record so as to have some form of protection if she really tried to fuck with my head and then I got out of there I still feel bad for her I think she is in love with her own self-pity Its helpful for me to write about this as its taken me a long time to really see with almost complete clarity that she was beginning to gaslight me in earnest even though I still kind of doubt this :/ And I still feel bad for her like I did something wrong Thank fuck I got out The moment that I made the decision to leave committed to it and then walked out into the living room and told her that I was doing it was one of the scariest moments of my life - like something from a horror movie but real cos the fear is in your skin not a screen Almost as scary was the sheer look of terror in her face a sick deranged look of fear and insanity which was masked in a split second of course - that switch was also so terrifying I feel gross writing about it Ive played it down in my head in the 4 months since I left its still quite confusing I dont know exactly what made me nope out but Im really fucking proud that I had the strength and self-respect to get out &#x200B; Edit: apologies for the essay I havent really been able to tell anyone about this in such detail thanks reddit,DoctimusLime,16218820930,2

hhj4jmg,qcqv9v,I dodged three nukes with one bad decision that saved my life my sanity and my future In the 90s I had my heart broken by an ex I had rescued from a bad relationship and moved back to my hometown with After my stint in the USN she had started contacting my grandmother I had little money but a decent job and an apartment I left the job to help her She was being terrorized by a guy she had met after we were separated by me being taken by CPS and moved away from an abusive family She contacted my grandma to ask for my help Grandma was the only person in the family that I spoke to I called her and agreed to help her get her things back We ended up together for 6 months before she called it off after reconnecting with her trashy hometown friends and hooking up with a guy at the E-club in San Diego I tried to contact her a few times She told me I was a stalker then swore I had broken into her car I had not She made it impossible for me to keep my new job by calling and complaining about me to my boss so I gave away all my non-portable possessions and took a job selling magazines all over the USA I was waiting for my GI Bill and financial aid to start school but why sit there and wait a whole year? This was a bad decision but it saved my ass The reasons for this decision being bad was the crew life We went from city to city state to state selling subscriptions in parking lots and door-to-door It sucked but I was good at it and had some fine adventures Everyone else seemed to be into meth or cocaine or heroin except for two kids from Oklahoma who I instantly got along with I kept copies of every subscription I sold which included the addresses and names of the people involved This quirk (and my habit of keeping every piece of paper for years) would later save my freedom and my future The first nuke I dodged came in Wisconsin Sometimes crews would send a team with a car handler to a separate location (a "spur") I did not get along with the car handler who would lead the spur I told him I didnt want to head out with his spur and he said "Get on or get beat" I had been on the road for almost 7 months by this time and never gotten into any scraps I just didnt feel like half the shit they argued and fought over was worth it But this was and I wasnt going to head out with a hard-drinking idiot who drove like a maniac in the best of times Short version of the dodged nuke: The car handler tried to beat me up and got a busted nose a raccoon mask and a sore set of balls for his trouble The POS tweaker who usually helped him "assert authority" in the past did not wish to join in Three days later the crew manager picked me up outside the Harley factory (after a rad day selling to assembly line workers) and said "Well theyre gone and I wanted you to know before you turn on the TV" The car handler drunk in Minnesota had rolled a van with 10 other young adults inside killing them all Two of them were close friends and the rest were just lost souls that liked things I did not (mostly drugs) The crew manager who was in some ways a decent guy couldnt handle the guilt and offered to get us hired on with other crews He was done with the business But it was time for me to go home and start school in a month so he paid me out thanked me and drove me halfway to CA (to TX) and got me a plane ticket home Along the way we hit a lot of strip clubs bars and pretty amazing restaurants he had discovered near hotels over his years in the business We became good friends on that last road trip Back home I had just settled into an apartment and called a friend to say I was in town and wanted to go buy some furniture I didnt know that the whole time before I returned my ex had convinced everyone I was stalking her harassing her husband-to-be/E-club sleazy hookup While I was gone she had filed for protective orders (which they never served and were thus dismissed) and had regularly filed police complaints about new "incidents" She told the Sheriffs who were trying to serve and find me that I was "hiding out and selling drugs to get by" Within an hour of that call to a friend who truly thought I had gone rogue and underground and was terrorizing my ex my door got kicked in and I was arrested I had no idea what for What I did have was receipts; 7 months of them all over the USA from WA to NC to Michigan What the police had was 5 reports one every month and a half of me assaulting menacing calling or burgling her I was shocked but I was innocent and knew it I kept my mouth shut and demanded a lawyer My Public Defender tried to sell me a deal which I was not having one bit of She demanded I explain how I would defend myself and I mentioned my magazine sales receipts and gave her my crew managers home phone number Two days later the charges were dismissed After that hearing her squid guy served me with her fresh DVRO 10 days later the fresh attempt at a DVRO was dismissed with prejudice when I showed up to the the hearing with receipts and a written and Fedexd letter from my former boss and now loyal amigo Nuke dodged She left state with her POS sailor who had finished his enlistment They apparently had a rocky relationship after the first kids were born She cheated on him often and he has hung in there I have seen pictures of their kids (we still have childhood friends in common and people always want to know about that time in my life) She looks haggard too Two of her kids look like a guy she cheated with from MySpace something I was made aware of by one of the same trashy friends (who is friends with one of my sisters) who took her to the E-club and now gleefully spreads news of her shitty existence She has filed multiple restraining orders against her cheat-exes and a couple against her husband is diagnosed as having a BPD and suffering from manic depression The Nuke I dodged there was that I loved her and I might have even taken her back after she cheated She contacted me on FaceBook and I immediately quit the app completely when I started feeling sentimental Holy crap No lady!

hhjc6g3,qcqv9v,Happened very recently I toured a garden level apartment in Chicago (standalone 3 flat) and it was filled with the at the time current tenants furniture and items Everything seemed nice and the apartment smelled good as there was a diffuser of some sort running Everything seemed good and I applied to get the apartment Everything came back and the Landlord said I can have the keys a day early as the previous tenant had moved out a day earlier Go to pick up the keys and spot check the empty apartment To my dismay the apartment wreaked of mold Check around the apartment and eventually found mold growing on the baseboard in the living room washer/dryer area and the *bedroom* All the mold during the showing was masked from a scent diffuser AND was being covered by the tenants furniture I had called and cancelled the lease right away since I still had not moved in The landlords leasing agent called me right away and attempted to quell the situation with "having someone come in and paint over the mold with mold killer" and "the apartment hadnt had the power on for a few days so thats why it has mold" Thankfully I got out with all my money invested Had to cancel all my services but was able stay back home for bit longer I found a much nicer and bigger apartment as well My rental agent had let me know that they had a similar situation from a coworker but their tenant had stayed and then was diagnosed with asthma 3 months after moving in Definitely feel very lucky to have gotten out when I did,jonoR34,16348488780,2

hhir3zg,qcqv9v,I was touring a college about two years ago and ended up in the health and safety building which just so happened to be the building I would primarily be in based upon my interest of study (nursing) I got to talking to the head teacher of the nursing department Its important to mention that this college operated way differently than most as there was only one teacher per department which is possible because of how small the school is Anyways the teacher was SUPER nice and helpful and I thought at that moment I would decide to go there Flash forward a month later and Im going down to the college to conduct an interview with the head of admissions Although I was already accepted I was meeting with the head of admissions to confirm my acceptance and to fill out paperwork I decided to swing by the health and safety building again to tell the teacher that Ill be seeing him a lot more and that Im excited to start studying under him This is when it gets interesting: The teacher left his job because he got an amazing job offer at another university I got to talking to the new teacher and THE FIRST thing he says to me is "did you know the moon landing covid and all STDs are fake?" I laughed because I thought "this guys the head of nursing at a university Surely hes joking" He then told me to "shut the hell up" and went on this 20 minute rant about masks the government and how his wife left him I dont mind people having personal beliefs You cant believe in whatever you want but as long as your a good person your good in my book however; this guy just came across rude and demeaning It totally turned me off from the university I ended up going into the admissions office and filed a formal complaint against the teacher I left and now attend a WAY better university If I didnt swing by that building I wouldve been in a WAY different scenario,Drinking-Ducks,16348403950,1

hsjjfub,s34d9b,Employees cut corners or dont comply with policies The best company I ever worked for treated their employees better than any job Ive ever seen The result: nobody cut corners nobody bent the rules nobody there didnt take their job seriously The reason: people lived their jobs People said "this is the best company in the world" without irony If you truly feel that kind of gratitude for your job you wont be piggybacking on other peoples badges you wont be walking around wearing your mask like a chin diaper you wont be deviating from procedures outlined by the company I just started a new job with a new company and after my last job Im shocked that people are piggybacking on me every day People dont follow procedures and say its pointless anyways Those were the first kinds of things I noticed and it shows me that the company has poor internal control because people dont care that much about this job Thats concerning to me right off the bat but it has only led to more observations that after these first 90 days make me feel that this company isnt a good fit and Ive resumed my job search as a result,Darth_Monday,16421100910,2
hsjp9kp,s34d9b,When in uni I was looking for something between the holidays in a call centre They told me it was customer intelligence research advertised it as back office admin and statistical work The interviewer explained the role as contacting customers who did not untick the "open to contact" box They got very defensive when I outed it was cold calling Basically the rebuttal was its warm calling to which I claimed semantics and that warm is such a subjective term and lets face it those tick boxes usually go without notice I left the interview after that explanation Basically anything that ends with cold calling gets the cold shoulder from me Job roles that arent what is advertised is a massive red flag They try to mask it with a lot of jargon which is a red flag on its own,EveningZealousideal6,16421122670,2

Hacking computers Simply not communicating in a way that would end the whole story like bad communication thats near unrealistic and feeds the whole plot The most obvious straightforward answers to things being ignored Nobody apparently has money problems either unless its a plot point Everyone has McMansions or the best cars etc Stalking lots and lots of creepy stalkerish behaviors masked as romance Fighting/assault or being hit by something treated like normal everyday things and people arent instantly injured or winded from it The only time someones unavailable is if them being missing is for the plot otherwise theyre always on the other side of that door or phone Friends Family you dont hate Zero miscellaneous life issues getting in the way of the plot unless its a plot point itself like having cancer or needing to poop Waking up looking amazing and also not completely disoriented,counselthedevil,16195418880,1
