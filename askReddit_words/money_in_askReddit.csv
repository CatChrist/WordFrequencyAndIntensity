hfe1o22,q18zrj,Reddit sucks Most people on this site are insufferable pseudo-intellectuals who lack the ability to think for themselves They cheer on censorship and discourage any kind of meaningful dialogue by downvoting anyone who dares to express an opinion that has not been deemed acceptable by the woke masses The site has been taken over by political interests who brainwash users and turn them into little keyboard warriors for the Elitist Democrat Party The front page is totally curated to help mold the minds of its users and create loyal little leftists At one point the "progressives" on Reddit were totally anti-Corporate and rightfully cheered for the separation of corporate money and politics Now those same "progressives" go to war for the likes of Pfizer J&J Google Twitter etc and support a president who was literally bought by billionaires (how much did Bloomberg donate to Bidens campaign in FL again?)

The couple we share a wall with are insanely sweet and try to feed us like all the time Its great because theyre wonderful cooks! And the building across from us I help one elderly single lady with her groceries because she stubbornly lives on the second floor and the man who lives under her well Shoot Ill sit on his front patio with him and talk for *hours* Hes an amazing storyteller Its been really good for me too Ive lost both grandfathers (one during covid) and Im no-contact with my moms mother and stepmother so I dont have very many older family members Im close with Its been really cathartic and Ive made some really good friends If you get the chance choose the old people!,3opossummoon,16193895580,2
gvvc4hl,myeqin,I work in a senior residence for mentally sound - yet physically frail - elderly people and living with them would be fine Fun in fact They are funny and dry and twisted They all have money and half of them have fully-stocked wet bars in their rooms When the pandemic started they discovered they could in fact order just about anything off Amazon and surround sound systems and flat screen TVs started showing up They someone learned about weed delivery (were in California) and it was game fucking on I tell my friends to remember all the shenanigans we got up to in our early twenties These guys are doing the exact same stuff just slower and with more money They drink smoke and fuck around with each other and no one has a job Its like working in a college dorm where no one ever goes home for break So yeah sign me up!,kadyg,16193921220,2
gvvev9b,myeqin,I did this for 2 years 18-20 but I also worked there I hated there Not because of the old people they were sweet my coworkers were spawns of satan worked there for so long they stopped seeing them has humans but bags of money Oh X person died clean up same day tonight we have a new person Tea time " here 1 hard biscuit and tea with no sugar nothing" fruit I took my time cutting apples in small pieces so and other hard fruit and I would get scolded for taking so long I staying longer than 5 min with a person I would get scolded I wanted to work in a nursing home since i was small I no longer wish that Because those 2 years gave me depression Im just to scared to end up like them I cant stand it,KatokaMika,16193936430,2
gvvfd65,myeqin,no because its not free clearly its transactional and you cant just have "free housing" you must do things to keep yourself able to stay so whats the point work make money get my own place its all me,Pkoch101,16193939130,2
gvvkz09,myeqin,Yeah absolutely You mean to tell me that I get to live for free somewhere thus saving a lot of money AND making some old peoples lives better by just being nice talking to them and being there? Hell I would be extra nice just for the fuck of it This is a no brainer I would even ask them about their stories make songs out of those and then sing them back to them,LightbulbBill,16193970060,2
gvvu2xf,myeqin,No I pay fairly high rent because I want my home life to be as enjoyable and comfortable as possible Imo its one of the best things to spend money on,TonyEisner,16194020780,2

gvvz4j0,myeqin,Absolutely Old people are awesome They tell the best stories and as a service man who often goes to retirement homes to set things up for the elderly residents I can say that their places are usually pretty damn nice That and in my area a ton of them offer duplex homes so its not just a cramped apartment I would LOVE to know how much money theyre bleeding out of those old folks retirement funds Its probably a horrifying amount,Prikkasaurus_Rex,16194049720,2

gvwkc2o,myeqin,I dont have the option This is my life I moved in with my parents because my father was diagnosed with a terminal disease I came to live with my mother to help her take care of my dad when I was 18 I am now 31 years old She doesnt have the financial ability to keep our home no matter what she does unless she wins the lottery We keep my father living with us in our rental home for many reasons but a stupid reason is because the state charges us an insane amount of money to have care givers He has full Medicaid but they need you to be full on poverty to help you at all My mother makes nothing but its still too much to have state help She makes $1200 a month but they will barely help pay the $2500 a month it costs for his care Yup This is my life,Mathews2121,16194199430,2
gvwmywa,myeqin,I dont even have enough time for my kids And if I had no kids Id have enough money to live comfortably travel and have fun so no need for rent-free flat So in both cases - no,scheisskopf53,16194222850,2
gvwpqp7,myeqin,If the free rent lets you save money you could use your savings to rent a second place,tutunka,16194249370,2
gvwx6yg,myeqin,No way I already found it difficult to live with my grandmother for a year when I was 18 to save money I couldnt imagine what a nursing home would be like Moving out as soon as I could was probably the best decision I made,shrinkyD123,16194321580,2
gvx26pr,myeqin,The cost-benefit analysis doesnt work out in my case "a few hours a day" lets say that means two hours a day every day 60 hours a month minimum (If "a few" means 3 then the math gets even worse) The amount of value Id earn per hour from this arrangement (cost of monthly rent / 60) is less than what my salary currently is So it would be better for me to just earn my rent money the normal way at my regular job Plus I am not in any way interested in hanging out with random people like that nor living among them I prefer my actual job and the freedom to choose my own apartment So this is a no all around for me Hard pass Obviously the cost-benefit analysis will depend on how expensive your rent is and how high your salary is But I think youd need to have pretty darn high rent relative to your salary to make this worthwhile,Syric,16194363660,2
gvvida5,myeqin,No Im just about to finish my 20s so its a good thing to reflect on Over the last 10 years me and my gf have gone from broke students in a 1 bed shithole to renting a few small houses struggling with renting/saving got a few pets with adds extra responsibility and make the saving grind even harder to now owning our first house and about to get married and start a family Having to overcome that meant I had to accelerate my career it was the only way to feasibly save and rent in the UK when one person is on minimum wage So Im in am earning bracket tha teenage me thought Id have in my 50s or something Trade all that for OPs offer? Saving would be faster but not being able to struggle and stress about money would deprive us of a significant amount of development Not being able to look after pets would not be the trial run of parenting that is has been Living in a room even a nice one in someone elses house would make us feel like kids and not grow up Id probably be earning 1/4 what I am now My 20s have felt like an adventure out in the wilderness making mistakes having close calls surviving developing If I had OPs offer Id be stuck in the comfy nest still basically a teenage 29 year old That sounds like an actual nightmare Hanging out with the seniors would be cool I like to cook so it would be cool to share exotic food with them and Id enjoy their stories but its not worth it due to the massive downsides that comfy rent free living would curse me with,Screen_Watcher,16193955720,1
gvursci,myeqin,Save Money and Getting Older Folks into one of my favourite hobbies sounds like a complete Win! Many of them already spend most of their days sitting and/or watching tv so Im certain many of them would make amazing gaming buddies and honestly I enjoy just sitting around watching docs and movies so if I have companions who know how to stay quiet (maybe fall asleep haha) during them and get to discuss series/movies with them after would be awesome!,Isaacest,16193820440,1
gvusnri,myeqin,Nope If Im required to spend a few hours a day there then this is not rent-free This is a job but instead of money you get a place to stay,Isario,16193824680,1
gvut8o8,myeqin,Great deal! Save money plus older ppl have a ton of wisdom to learn from Could be a transformational experience,Agitated_Elephant469,16193827500,1
gvutiuy,myeqin,Yes but only if I could choose to leave The reason being living rent and utility free you could probably work and save up a lot of money Then when youve got enough saved you could head out and get your own place,EasilyForgotten1,16193828860,1
gvuvt1x,myeqin,I would try but the issue is that my busy season is ~4 months long and requires 12+ hours of work 6 days a week If im gone from 7 to 9 (one hour travel) i doubt id be able to put in those hours to talk Sounds like itd be a great idea to help save money (for the individual),Dead-HC-Taco,16193839850,1
gvuw1an,myeqin,No I wouldnt Never! A few hours is a lot and no matter who you are a certain amount of time spent with the elderly is fine but daily that can hurt you mentally Grandmothers will try and overfeed you regardless of what your weight is so debating anything semi-serious is out of the question I have worked IT in a hospital for 1 week and noped the hell out immediately Surrounded by death age smells sounds endless hallways the general lack of life and joy its mind numbing! Even just talking to doctors and sensing how inferior you feel then fixing their issue and feeling even worse The other staff being underpaid stress smoke breaks all the health workers take Fuck no I wouldent even take money to do that I have worked in the bar and restaurant industry doing 12 hour days and would take any day there over the hospital! Money is important but my own personal well-being is more important,legice,16193840900,1
gvuw5bi,myeqin,It would depend on a few factors 1) Depends on the home Retirement homes and nursing homes at least where I live are *very* different - retirement homes are for those who can live pretty independently (ie can wash themselves feed themselves toilet themselves etc) while nursing homes are for people who need more care such as washing dressing toileting medication administration etc Therefore interacting with people in a retirement home would be vastly different from those in a nursing home 2) Depends on the expectation of hours and types of activities expected of me I work 12-hour shifts On working days I dont have "a few hours" to spare However I could drop down to a part-time job or one with less demanding hours if I didnt have to pay rent Also am I just expected to hang out and interact with the residents or do I actually have to do work like washing people or cleaning? 3) What are my living arrangements like? Can I bring my cat? Can I expect a reasonable amount of privacy? Can I lock my door? People with dementia tend to wander and I know some can go into the wrong room and rummage through other peoples thingsor worse 4) Is it only rent-free or am I provided other things such as access to amenities meals etc? If I dont have to pay for most of my food or pay hydro fees then that would just sweeten the deal further and make the arrangement more appealing OVERALL Id probably go for it as long as I only had to hang out with the residents (and NOT have to do actual work) especially if it were just a retirement home I work as an RN I dont mind the elderly I can deal with most behaviours (but as I said as long as I can lock my door) Death? Sure it can be sad but death is not the worst thing in the world For a lot of people especially the very old its a relief A lot of older people have so many stories to tell I once volunteered at a nursing home and there was one lady who would carry secret military information in WW2 She would tell us of all the interesting people she met too One nursing home resident I looked after was a former nurse As a nursing student (at the time) she would tell me what it was like to be a nurse when she was younger - a far different experience than mine I love hearing what the world was like decades ago Not technically a nursing home resident but my dad has told me things that fascinate me He remembers going to school before ballpoint pens were the norm He said they would take turns refilling the ink wells at everyones desk in the classroom He told me how they practiced handwriting intensively and the teacher would correct them on things like the slant of their letters He said getting his COVID vaccine brought back memories of him waiting in line for the newly-released polio vaccine He watched the moon landing and gave money to Terry Fox as he ran through Toronto All of this happened before I was even born Obviously this would not be something I would do forever - it would just be for a couple of years perhaps while I saved some money to move into my own place,duckface08,16193841440,1
gvuwvnj,myeqin,Yes 100% Id be saving loads of money plus theres gotta be at least a couple of old people who have some interesting stories,Bloo-shadow,16193844950,1
gvuyfnu,myeqin,It depends on the time Im currently going into the military for the first four years The next six years would be great cause I could be saving money and doing college work so that would work out perfectly,MrNubbyNubs,16193852230,1
gvuypnb,myeqin,I wouldnt take it Id rather pay rent and continue to live in my flat and have the freedom to choose what to do with my time Several hours a day adds up to a lot of hours of my life and not being paid for it would mean I still have to keep my job so although I live rent-free I have to trade that for my leisure time I would maybe take this opportunity for like 3 months as a volunteer kinda scheme but only if I wasnt losing money in the process,Jypahttii,16193853530,1
gvuz69p,myeqin,Fuck yeah I would Id work get home and chill the fuck out with my roommates play some spades rummy chess watch some tv and live like a fuckin boss with my roommate making sure to take him/her for crazy trips in their golden years listening to their stories And when the experience was over Id have all the saved money to go live my life with so many stories from so many lifetimes I can cherish my lifetime with,i_play_withrocks,16193855790,1

gvv07af,myeqin,I mean theres a fine line between this and a job You know one day the workers cant help but ask for help moving them or feeding them ect Then it just becomes a job Plus I would need money for food and fun stuff so I would have to get a job outside of spending time with the elderly so then Id using up as much time as a full time job So why wouldnt I just get a full time job and pay for my own place with more privacy? Really thoughtful idea but it would snowball into just another full time job scenario,jibabadebadido,16193860770,1
gvv0pxz,myeqin,hum maybe depends on how many hours and when if it has to be in the middle of the day that might make it hard to have another job in there so as to have spending money If it was something where I could spend a whole day or two to fulfill those hours that might be easier would depend a lot on the details the room any other perks of the living space where this nursing home is lots of things to consider,TONKAHANAH,16193863310,1
gvv0sl5,myeqin,A retirement home yes A nursing home no If its only 2-3 hours a day during the week and flexibility on weekends and depending on how my living area is set up Id jump on it on a heartbeat Not just the financial savings but think of the stories and viewpoints youd get from that generation Wouldnt agree with everything but anything that makes you think and self reflect would only improve your life and grow as a person Also ten years of saving rent money and investing? Your financial future is so much more secure Ive visited and enjoyed time with older relatives and friends grandparents living in retirement communities A lot of them in the late 60s to 70s are still extremely active physically and mentally Even some of the early 80s are still very active socially and mentally They just dont want the hassle of maintaining a home and want the security of medical and nutritional staff nearby It would be a blast picking their brains chatting about various topics getting their perspectives and many of them are curious and want to learn more about current issues Theres a lot of life lessons learned on both sides,MoarGnD,16193863680,1
gvv0zqh,myeqin,A lot of people in this thread are failing to see the opportunity cost The top comment says that one could see these few hours a day as an easy part time job that pays for their housing The problem with this is what this means for ones lost earning and investment potential Suppose your tent is $700 a month (low but not unreasonable for a young person with a roommate) That amount divided by an estimated 30 days per month is about $23 per day If you had to spend minimum 3 hours per day to earn those $23 dollars you would be getting paid a maximum rate of $766/ hour which is a miserable hourly rate Whats more you would have no days off from this part-time job and none of your housing money would go towards an appreciating asset like the purchase of a home Im in my 20s own my house pay $700 a month for my mortgage and make several times more than $766 / hour so I would absolutely not do this especially given how my home has appreciated by nearly $35000 in the last two and a half years,TAI0Z,16193864660,1
gvv15dj,myeqin,I volunteered in the dying/dementia ward in HS where I spent my weekends with visiting old folks that would give their left leg for company but you would also see clients who throw feces at you for no reason if you came to their door randomly Saving money is great but your mental health matters too I wouldnt do it as Im in my 30s and my grandparents have Alzheimers and dementia and it gives me an obscene amount of anxiety You see very often the longer theyre in the units the less their family visits and when they do its a whole lot of bickering over money and wills and Power of Attorney and the client is usually just silent about it or very upset because they literally cannot understand People who would do this so they can hope to weasel their way into someones will are the slime of the earth,inadequatelyadequate,16193865420,1
gvv186c,myeqin,I am going to assume that there is no payment involved and meals are also included I would probably say yes but that depends on how is the living situation Do i have my very own room and a bathroom? If so then yeah Saving money on rent and meals for some time while also trying to make the lives of older people better doesnt sound bad at all,TheArtOfVEL,16193865780,1

Imagine you can earn 2-3k Dollar with a full time job Or you can only work half the time for 1-15k Dollar That means you are missing out 1-15k Dollar per month Is the home worth that much money per month? Its like renting it for 1-15k Dollar,HappyBengal,16193866540,1
gvv1qat,myeqin,Damn straight I would! Id consider it my job and responsibility If I was living rent free I would only need to work part time to get money for other expenses so Id absolutely have the time to spend with elders who likely are pretty lonely,grosselisse,16193868210,1
gvv1ztg,myeqin,Old people are the best They have stories about thing you couldnt even think of On the other hand its a huge thing to think about When I was 20/21 hell yes no hesitation I wanted to just make money and have fun spending it Now I would have to weigh my options Theres probably rules they have about guests so youd have to be a single person Who is ok with having your only friends and family being old people who are only going to be there a few years,moonzilla87,16193869500,1
gvv29ar,myeqin,I would love this but unless Im getting paid money to do this its not worth my time I have a full time job I have personal interests I have to maintain my relationships with my friends and family With my atrocious time management abilities I wouldnt be able to devote few hours everyday to spend time with older people I wouldnt mind volunteering for something like this when I do have the time I wouldnt even need the free housing,Alexexy,16193870810,1

gvv2p77,myeqin,So I guess ill make a thread asking "If you got free money every day and just had to hang out with cats for a few hourswould you take the money?" and collect 10k internet points?

gvv2pdn,myeqin,There are several initiatives doing stuff like this - living in apartments in the homes living on the same site living on adjacent sites mandatory interaction voluntary interaction quid-pro-quo interaction Theyre all really good ideas However the best idea is making the move to retirement living before you are *forced* to do so by your health or by your circumstances The earlier you move the longer and healthier you live With this particular option Id be tempted but ultimately Id have to pass Im not an extrovert and spending *hours* per day around other people outside of work would probably kill me Although if I saved enough money through non-payment of rent I might be able to go part-time Ok maybe Id suffer for a year or two to build up a nest egg then switch to part-time Id survive,Musashi10000,16193872980,1

Sign me up Most homes have been overtaken by greedy shits who fail to provide proper care leaving the care providers overwhelmed and underfunded Ive met alot of careproviders that are underpaid exhausted and overworked But we could easily have a better system What if you signed up to take care of the elderly like you sign up to join the Marines?

gvv3ghw,myeqin,I used to deliver pizza in an old money town so there were 5 nursing homes there I would rather die than be a resident of 4 of those There was only 1 were I would consistently find employees present AND the employees would actually know the names and locations of their residents The others were just boxes to stuff old people in until they die staff didnt even know names most of the time,Amusei015,16193876630,1
gvv3ja8,myeqin,When I was about 10 my parents introduced me to an elderly woman in the neighborhood and told me to visit her twice a week Tuesday and Friday to take out her garbage and get her mail She paid me a dollar each visit which for a 10 year old in 1983 was good for a few video games at the arcade At first I didnt want to do it but I did it and a few weeks in I found myself sitting in her living room listening to her tell me stories about her life before during and after the depression I ended up checking on her more frequently and getting her mail and taking out her trash but not wanting any money I quickly grew to adore this woman About a year later we moved and I said goodbye to her Never seeing her again I think about her from time to time and I look back now and realize I was a surrogate Grandson and she my Grandmother who I hadnt seen since moving away Im not in my 20s and I wouldnt live in a nursing home But if you have the chance you should visit one Its not that easy these days with security But you will find some will encourage someone to just come visit some of the lonlier people who dont get visitors,sebrebc,16193877010,1

gvv49he,myeqin,Yes Its not like it would be a permanent thing I assume A couple years to save up money Would the meals you take with them be free too? Id be there with them breakfast lunch & dinner,Black_Magic_M-66,16193880600,1
gvv4c5g,myeqin,Absolutely! 1) you can save money for a home down the road Real estate is stupid expensive and you have to have a substantial amount of money for a down payment 2) elderly people have so much to offer They want to have someone around to hear their stories and there are so many stories that should be shared I recently lost my last grandparent and I had the privilege and honor of hearing her tell me stories she never shared with the family When I presided over her graveside I was able to share those stories and it brought so much joy in spite of the circumstances,Sweet-Lady-H,16193880970,1
gvv4cyp,myeqin,I probably would not have done this when I was 20-30 but knowing what I know now if I could go back to that age Id accept that deal in a heartbeat and Id do so for several reasons First the amount of money that could be saved and invested in housing or retirement later would be pretty significant Second the stuff that you can learn from your elders if you have sense enough to pay attention and heed their advice is immeasurable And Third it would be a simple kindness to spend some time and listen to these people and a little bit of kindness is never time wasted,Adddicus,16193881080,1

gvv51nm,myeqin,1000% No Rent-free implies I still have some expenses Even if I had no expenses Id still have desires that cost money like buying cool stuff and going out for dinner on trips etc So I go to work to make money then I come back to hang with some old people (which is a job some people get paid to do) Wheres the time to do my own thing? Even if I only have to work part time the hanging with old peeps is basically a second job for an introvert like me I fail to see how that is worth saving a thousand bucks or so,Stupid-comment,16193884570,1
gvv52g7,myeqin,Hell yes! I could save so much money if I dont have to pay for rent And its kinda interesting when you hear stories from the elderly! I would love to talk to someone or hear the experiences of someone who was born 70 or 80 years ago It would probably humble me as well,those_silly_dogs,16193884680,1
gvv5cep,myeqin,Totes I like playing crib and saving money Whats the downside? Plus fishing and hunting buddies that are likely to be highly chill and lots of old folks are getting into gaming So yeah it could be great,thunderchunks,16193886100,1
gvv5dgd,myeqin,Absolutely I would have saved so much money back then Plus I like old people anyway so thats just a winning situation all around,pineapples330,16193886250,1
gvv5e24,myeqin,So saving my money and having company for free? i really dont see the downside here,kingsofheaven,16193886340,1
gvv5rwo,myeqin,Not a chance I used to live in an apartment Never again Theyd need to pay me substantial money to combine that with also needing to work every day,Fissionlight,16193888300,1
gvv60e1,myeqin,Just rent free means you still need another job So it would be equivalent to having two jobs one with no advancement/raise opportunity It also depends on what "with the other residents" means If it is all residents or a rotation then definitely a job But if you can pick specific residents then it would just be up to finding/making friends that share your interests Of course since this question requires capitalism/homelessness then we can go the cold capitalistic route of exploiting them for money Other old people that you dont have to deal with are found cute by our society so putting together a number of the interested old people in a minecraft server filming everything and hiring editors to put together good you tube channels for each is a great way to make plenty of cash,UnfortunatelyEvil,16193889520,1
gvv6hwd,myeqin,No Why would I do that when I can get paid substantially more money to work in a retirement home and go home to a house or apartment away from all that?,Mitch_from_Boston,16193892080,1
gvv6ijo,myeqin,Pros: -I would be saving a lot of money -Even though its out of obligation than charity spending a few hours a day with senior citizens (whom are often disregarded) could be me giving back to the community -I could write a book or at the very least a blog about my experience "Living among the elderly" I may feel attached to them They were once young Pass on their wisdom from experience Cons: -It would dampen my social/dating life bringing people over to my place Especially if I have to live by all of their rules and share a room with somebody -I would be surrounded by death all the time -The retired residents may start to see me as extra help and treat me that way Would I take it? Probably for a few months and see where it goes from there That is if I have a room of my own and the rules do not apply to me I would probably try to make the best of it I would most likely either have an early morning walk/breakfast with them or give a class on how to use modern technology,GyaradosDance,16193892170,1
gvv6q4x,myeqin,ABSOLUTELY Id do that for at least a year just so I could save money but after that Id need my freedom back since Im basically 30 lol If I had this opportunity post-college I would have jumped on it Prior to college I was homeless for a bit I have no family to fall back on My savings are small because being poor makes it hard to become *not* poor Im finally escaping some debt but its very hard with no help or safety nets from family Instead I sometimes have to help *my mom* pay her bills so she doesnt become homeless even though shes the one who originally left me in a homeless shelter as a teen in the first place :),Ehloanna,16193893240,1
gvv7a7f,myeqin,I would take this no question Not only could you stack some money you could learn so much from the elderly and their experiences People love to talk about themselves,Daznice01,16193896100,1
gvv7bxv,myeqin,Hell yes not having to pay for housing and meals in exchange for eating meals and hanging out with old people for a little bit each day is completely worth it You could really save up a lot money doing that and also learn a lot,MaizeNBlueWaffle,16193896350,1
gvv7fgq,myeqin,Absolutely! Ive always had a soft spot for the elderly I enjoy listening to their stories and I love old music movies and fashion Spending time with them would be no problem for me Id gladly do it,yagirlbmoney,16193896820,1
gvv7jur,myeqin,Fuck yes especially if you can still work a job and save money Paid housing? Early retirement,DocPeacock,16193897400,1
gvv7uoi,myeqin,Ive seen something like this as an option for student housing in London Its win-win really as long as both get along The student saves on housing and gets the perspective of someone who is not exactly like them in terms of age and life experience and maybe some adulting lessons their parents may have not taught them (cooking etc) The senior gets a a little money and a minimum amount of care and company They also get the perspective of someone who is not exactly like them in terms of age and life experience,Lucia37,16193898830,1
gvv80ta,myeqin,Definitely not First off unless you live somewhere with super expensive rent this is already a bad deal We will assume "a few" is at least 3 hours because thats the minimum that can be a few Thats 3 hours per day Lets say a 30 day month just to go with the lower amount Thats 90 hours per month 1000 divided by 90 hours is only 1111 per hour which is a pretty damn low amount Now you may say "but it isnt like work so it is different" Well I really dont like being around old people so it isnt different at all to me Hell I dont think Id want to spend 3 hours a day with almost any group of people for 11 dollars an hour much less a group of random retirees Not to mention that even if you loved being around old people you would essentially have a ton of roommates that are constantly getting sick and/or dying Have fun dealing with that So no Im good Id rather either just have that time to myself or if I needed the money that badly get a part time job,Gewurzratte,16193899630,1
gvv886i,myeqin,Ive heard of this being done already Its with University students that still pay for rent (highly discounted though) and help with some chores and time spent with the senior in their home Ive heard too of living rent free in an actual retirement facility too - exchanging their time to do so As a student I would be more inclined to do so It sure would be a quiet place to study Im thinking! And being a student with not much money I wouldnt be spending lots on going out/having dinner parties etc anyways However I probably wouldnt want to live in one if I was working Id most likely be going out lots and not wanting to spend my time just hanging out at home,Shartran,16193900620,1
gvv888c,myeqin,I would do it short term to save money,avidsdead,16193900630,1
gvv8bg2,myeqin,Um hell yes I would definitely take it! So would my SO Id work use all of that extra money Im saving on rent for savings and to pay off student debt and every night wed have dinner together and movie / game nights Sounds like a dream honestly,Lifegoeson3131,16193901050,1
gvv8c98,myeqin,Yes because after those few hours with the residents I can just relax and not have to worry about money I could also help out in the kitchens since Im a good cook,Snapdragon_Arts,16193901160,1
gvv8roo,myeqin,A retirement home probably although Id have to see how much I actually save Its where people with enough money to retire go to and the people there at least to my knowledge are happier and healthier Not saying its be great but itd let me save money and shit like that A nursing home absolutely not I dont want to spend time with a bunch of dying people who are often just put there so their family doesnt have to deal with them (sometimes for good reason),Y-draig,16193903390,1
gvv8tvn,myeqin,I worked in a nursing home Its horrible Rent free doesnt make something desirable in any way Its on par with living in a shelter Thats rent free too Id rather have my own place and do visits So no I wouldnt but its not because I wouldnt want to hang with the elderly its because those places are terrible unless its a super expensive one which most cannot afford The best part of the job was hanging out with them but it was heart breaking and my job was low level so I couldnt make much of a difference I felt The was a sweet lady named pearl who just an angel Her son stole her money and they sent her to that place that was absolutely a garbage place The staff were horrible there People got ignored I had been a caregiver in another state but didnt have licensing so while waiting for the next class I was a janitor and I wasnt allowed to help people People who needed help with buttons or someone just to talk not even medical stuff I got in trouble a few times for helping but staff would strait up ignore calls When pearl died her shitty son didnt even call on her birthday that was three days prior let alone visit when he lived close They were gonna throw out her belongings She had all these cards from her husband and friend both who were dead so I saved them I had to be the one to clean up her room and throw all her precious stuff out because her garbage son didnt want or even look at any of it He did have them save her wedding ring tho He convinced her to sign over her assets to him so he could sell her house to get her care Her husband was some fancy Hollywood guy who worked with celebs in the 40s and she actually was well off but he put her in the shittiest cheapest place possible and bought himself a house and boat with the money This place literally had 4 residents to a bathroom It was mostly for medicaid users and impoverished elderly so the quality is terrible No one deserves that but she could have bought herself a nice place It was totally messed up She would always say if her husband knew what her son did he would roll in his grave Never brought the grandkids by to visit or nothing Broke my heart I legit got in trouble one time for helping a woman who had her shirt stuck on her head because she called for help and no one came so she did it herself and got stuck till I found her They left people in urine for way too long Another lady fell and stayed on the floor for hours Her face was all super bruised and then she slept for three days before dying There was also an old dude who super sweet but come to find out he was actually a murderer and they arrested him and he went to court n stuff Pretty sure he killed his wife too It was in the news and stuff He was a total flirt and super sweet so that was a shock,waydacookiecrumbles,16193903710,1
gvv8z55,myeqin,No I like doing things other than staying inside and those things require money So I have to work in a nursing home and do the work and yay I have housing but no freedom? As a 20-30 year old? Absofuckinglutely not Edit: Just realized the actual meaning of your question I think Id live with some retired folks for free any day if it didnt disrupt my normal life Our elders are awesome! They have some of the wildest and coolest stories And they tend to love people in their 20s-30s Sounds like a better time than living alone as a 25 year old just saying When I first read the question I thought the posit was that Id be trapped in this place lol,dasHeftinn,16193904490,1
gvv9ri1,myeqin,I think multi-generational living will become more common and less stigmatized in the US given economic realities Imagine youve got the dad whos about 65 His wife has died and he lives in the house he raised his family in Hes still capable of staying there and keeping it up but its a lot and its also lonely His daughter is 35 she and her husband have a two-year old and despite having good jobs all their money goes to housing and daycare His son is 32 and single and lives in an apartment thats both expensive and crappy Everyone moving back in together would solve a lot of problems as long as they got along and had strong ground rules,KatJen76,16193908590,1

gvvaiep,myeqin,I dont particularly like this question Its a question dont get me wrong even if I dont think its a particularly good one You ask this to a homeless person obviously they will do it Ask this to a mormon you might think theyll obviously do it Thats the problem though If someone already has a place maybe even a great place why would they live there? In fact I dont quite understand what being 20-30 years old has to do with anything anyways Is there a reason older people cant volunteer for this? Why cant you give a 50y/o the same opportunity as a 20-30y/o? It just doesnt really make sense I think the real question here is would you go to a retirement/nursing home just to get the opportunity to spend time with people who may not get to see others outside often Even then I think this question is contradictory because (unless someone is actively trying not to fit in) most people would say yes to the proposal of it But Im almost certain no one would actually go out and do it themselves (unless there is a caveat like money already have someone living in a nursing home someone reminds you youre bored etc) Bad question bad sub,LunSaper,16193912500,1
gvvaw3l,myeqin,I would absolutely do it no hesitation I have grandparents that were born in England before Wod War 2 who I talk to pretty often and the conversations I have with them are some of the best most interesting and informational Ive ever had Listening to them talk about what life was like when they were growing up to when the war started and how they did their part to aid the war effort is simply fascinating to me as both a family member and history nerd My grandfather joined the Merchant Navy which was an extremely crucial job in the defense of Britain The Merchant Navy were the people supplying raw materials arms ammo fuel food etc throughout the war The Merchant Navy had a higher casualty rate than almost every other branch of the armed services I would love to hang out with and talk to people about their life their history or whatever else they wanna tall about even if there isnt anything necessarily extraordinary about it Plus I would be able to save a lot of money on rent and all that!,rapture189,16193914500,1

gvvcbw0,myeqin,It sounds enticing but I have *extreme* reservations about this from a legal standpoint I am not a lawyer and my personal viewpoints on labor law and landlord-tenant law are though the lens of only having ever lived and worked in California (USA) I know that it is permissible under CA law to offer rent free living space as compensation for work but its pretty fraught and should be avoided There must be ironclad contract terms that assign dollar amounts to the value of the employees labor and the rent even though no money is exchanged Those dollar amounts may be subject to minimum wage regulations as well as withholdings for social security federal state and local taxes etc *even though no money is exchanged* The tenant also has rights that may make it hard to fire them since they have to be evicted at the same time Its such a complicated needle to thread that I couldnt just give the employer the benefit of the doubt that they are scrupulous and diligent about avoiding practices that are technically labor abuse and/or tenant abuse On the contrary as a prospective onsite elder-care volunteer I would be very suspicious that the facility management might actually be using this system to get away with abusive practices on purpose and I would want to see some kind of proof otherwise before I seriously considered it Even if my suspicions in that regard were completely satisfied I would still have questions about what other corners they might be trying to cut Beyond that elder care is **medical care** I totally understand the benefit of increased socialization for the residents - better quality of life better neuroplasticity less likelihood of depression and more It would be one thing to provide that kind of social engagement with system of trained but unpaid volunteers or interns A system like that would attract young people who aspire to medical field careers and would help the volunteers build a strong and unique CV The training part is important because you have to consider whose face-time with the residents is being "supplemented" (ie: replaced) by these unpaid workers - Nurses Doctors People with other types of degrees and qualifications in professional elder care The kinds of people who have serious investment in their careers and who know better than an average joe how to actively look for symptoms of stroke heart attack cognitive dysfunction signs of elder abuse and more People who are familiar with the residents medication schedules and arent likely to look the other way if a resident tries to say sneak in a six pack even though they are diabetic Or even something even more benign like a resident asking to have a glass of grapefruit juice from the lunch buffet Im not saying that everyone who even visits a retirement home needs to have gone to a high-falootin medical school I just mean that even an unpaid volunteer position in a facility like that should be filled by someone who understands the importance and seriousness of their role explicitly and that recruitment for such a position should be undertaken in a way that attracts very high-quality candidates Using rent-free onsite accommodations to attract applicants would probably work but it would muddy the waters with candidates who just dont have better living arrangements for whatever reason There are lots of reasons why a rent-free apartment would be attractive to lots and lots of people and weeding through all those people for the best possible candidate would be a nightmare From the viewpoint of a prospective resident or the child of a prospective resident knowing that the facility attracts unpaid staff by letting them live onsite for free would raise questions about the quality of medical care available there Not deal-breaking questions but questions,RealDanStaines,16193922360,1

gvvcz0z,myeqin,Well calculating it out 3 hours each day adds to 21 hours a week Or bout 90 hours a month on average Assuming you make 15 an hour which is pretty low in my area you would make 1350 with that time spent It barely comes to a net even with rent being about that much a month in my area for a one bedroom All in all I probably would as though it is in effect a second part time job it would require less effort than a real job and not be taxed That said if you make much more than 15 the math would no longer support it as well as the extra money wouldnt be as big a deal,Puoaper,16193925910,1

gvvfrs6,myeqin,No because I have money,anoldradical,16193941200,1
gvvfurw,myeqin,It depends on the prevailing rent in the area and the required number of hours Discounting whether one actually likes spending time with geriatrics (tbh I actually do) one can simply calculate the time-value of that required time and compare that to ones earning ability For example if you get a nice 1BD "apartment" in a nice area of SF from that deal and you are obligated to spend a minimum of 10 hours/week then its almost $60/hr at $30k annual rent ($25k average monthly) for 520 hours/yr to "make rent" Now $60k/hr is equivalent to >$120k per year annual income so some 20-30 year old person may find that to be attractive because they would have to work longer hours for the same living space This benefit can further provide them flexibility in choosing jobs and making decisions without the burden of ensuring they have enough to cover rent I know of a few people back when I was in that age group who would change professions if money wasnt an overriding concern There are still other outstanding considerations however For example well still need to factor the tax implications of such an arrangement; just because you live rent-free doesnt mean the IRS will consider that as a zero-value gift (even if you do provide services in return) And for some young people living in a retirement/nursing home may be enough of a mental block that its unlikely theyll agree to it regardless of the terms,MrFantasticallyNerdy,16193941660,1
gvvg5ho,myeqin,I would not I hate feeling "obligated" and some days I just wouldnt want to see anyone Since only rent is free Id still have to work for everything else I pay for which also takes away a lot of my free time too Itd be better to just work and have my own place with privacy Im not greedy for money anyway just want enough to not have to think twice before buying that $15 burger or pizza,CelticDK,16193943310,1

gwp6cpv,n34b7f,I once had a patient tell me they liked to touch at least 10 different ceilings per day He kept a ladder in his vehicle Every business or home he went into he would try to touch the ceiling He would disguise himself as a Handyman and pretend he was fixing a ceiling tile or replacing a light bulb When confronted by business owners he would tell them that he was called in by corporate When he went to church on Sundays and Wednesdays he would wait until the entire congregation left then he would haul in his ladder sometimes using the pews for his ladder so he could get high enough to reach the ceiling Once the pandemic hit and nearly all businesses and churches shut down he became very anxious He knew he had to find a different way to achieve his goal of 10 ceilings per day Anything less than 10 ceilings per day was just not acceptable He considered grocery stores but knew that most of the ceilings inside of a grocery store were too high He considered breaking into businesses after hours but wanted to limit his criminal liability He even contemplated buying 10 outdoor sheds to place in his backyard but quickly realized that his backyard was not big enough because he lived in an apartment So what did he do? He quit his job as a Taxidermist and started an appliance repair company Working 10 hours per day he was able to visit 10 different homes He once told me that the downsides were that he was making much less money and working around 70 hours per week He told me that the upside was that his wife divorced him because he was never home After his divorce he stopped seeing me I guess he no longer needed the therapy,klondikeblizzard,16199825560,66

gwocyni,n34b7f,People are really afraid to admit theyre depressed and have had or currently do have suicidal thoughts The mental health system weve set up here in America (where I live) causes patients to think theres a big red button waiting to be pushed if they admit that When in actuality theres going to be a series of questions we ask if someone admits this Theres nuances to suicidal thoughts and professionals know that We arent just going to push the button Theres the series of questions we have to ask first And after the questions such as "how often?" "do you have an actual plan?" "do you want to hurt others?" "have you ever or are you self harming?" "do you have vivid visual thoughts about your death?" "do you intend to carry out any of the plans youve made or are these just thoughts you wouldnt act on?" "in the past 6 months have you taken any steps at all towards ending your life?" Most of my patients dont actually plan to kill them selves This isnt to say the statement shouldnt be taken seriously But most of them are just having thoughts they dont plan to act on The most common answer I receive is "I just want to sleep Im so tired So sometimes I think of if I sleep forever all of my problems will just go away But I dont really want to die" Its usually the sheer responsibility of life and all that has to be done weighing them down New patients or reoccurring patients are terrified of being committed to a psych ward (especially ones whove already gone) Its for a good reason honestly Unless you have a lot of money to go somewhere nice state hospitals are terrible People come back to me more traumatized than before and we have a whole new set of problems This setting is not really meant to heal anyone Its kind of just strictly there to baby sit you unfortunately In serious situations this can be what someone needs when there are no other options The point is suicidal thoughts are normal to a degree with certain mental illnesses Obviously the greater of lifes pressures my patients face like death illness or losing a job the more serious the thoughts can get In those cases well pay closer attention if theres bigger red flags But patients who are experiencing depression even to a minor degree may ruminate on death and we know this We dont want you to be afraid to tell us because of the system thats been created It makes me really sad that weve created this environment where patients dont want to be honest about these thoughts because of state hospitals or the "red button" fear Please dont suffer alone Whether youre just ruminating or actually planning tell someone preferably your therapist This could be a huge piece of information were missing in your treatment and we need to know whats triggering it Theres a good chance we could be making changes in lifestyle and meds And on the other end theres a chance being in the hospital sucky as it is could save your life But before thats decided we need to hear it to know what you need,ImaginationWitty2524,16199715530,15

I glance around nervously Not shockingly the place doesnt have security cameras or safety measures of any sort I ask her to elaborate Apparently a customer had taken a liking to the girl and begun to stalk her Since she was always there alone easy target (sad irony since the place worked for the womens shelter) One day he came in and decided to make a move pinned her in a corner and was groping her She fought him off and ran As someone who is a domestic abuse survivor and having had a stalker ex myself this makes me very uneasy Im new to the area but even I know the police presence doesnt count for much and if you catch the wrong methhead on the wrong day its gonna be a bad time I ask if anything had been done was there security or cameras had the guy been caught? Nope "Oh also" she rambles on "if anyone comes in asking about the hats they arent looking for hats The last girl who got fired sold drugs on her shift and that was her code Every now and again I get an old junkie coming back thinking she still works here" Okayyyy Im rapidly rethinking my career choice Before I had time to ponder too long the boss lady from the office (whom Id filled out paperwork with this morning) makes an appearance So much for never coming in She indicates she wants to talk to my coworker privately so they go to the front of the store and I awkwardly stay in the back with the cash register hoping to God no one comes in Coworker returns looking like shes about to burst into tears Shes the quietest shes been the whole shift (about 4 hours in at this point) and quickly goes to her purse She excuses herself and says it was nice to meet me before breezing outta the store Boss lady comes up and I ask her about my coworker leaving so distressed is she ok? The boss lady hardly batted a lash and told me "Oh I fired her" Im shocked She didnt want to give details but apparently wasnt happy with how my coworker had been handling the money She tells me I can go shes gonna close up early Stunned I gather up my things and left As Im leaving she hollers that shell email me my schedule tomorrow Obviously there was no tomorrow I didnt even know where to begin to explain why I wouldnt be back but that was the wildest 4 hour shift at a new job of my life If that was day one what the hell else was in store if I stayed??

gxus01p,n9jyqk,I got a job at a makeup counter in a local department store for a little extra pocket money on top of my 9-5 job It seemed like it would be a good way earn a little extra money in a low stress position and the discounts were a nice bonus I wasnt there to make a career out of it The first hour there I was given a run down of our products shown where everything is etc the manager on duty was young and friendly So far so good After the initial tour she started to go into my daily job expectations I was to sell a certain amount of dollars per day The number was quite high and if I didnt meet expectations I wouldnt get certain commissions or bonuses and could be written up It didnt matter how long my shift was or how busy the store was If it was slow I was expected to try and accost customers outside the entrance in the mall There were lots of targets to reach: sell a number of products they were promoting dollar amount per shift number of customers to approach etc The commission scale was confusing and looked like I would be earning a lot less than advertised I had to approach a certain number shoppers and offer them a free makeover - never mind that I wasnt a makeup artist This interested me so I asked about what tools I could use the makeup we could sample what the sanitization techniques were and where I could wash the brushes between customers She looked at me like I grew an extra head She gestured towards the makeup display "Everything you need is there" "there" was crusty unwashed brushes and makeup that had obviously been sampled by dirty finger tips I asked about cleaning the brushes and sanitizing makeup (like that big brand does) And I was told that I could if I wanted to but they didnt really have any brush cleaner or sanitizer and I had to use the sinks in the public restroom since there was no running water at the counter Gross After a bit more training it was time to clock out She then showed me where to find the staff schedule She explained that she put the schedule up every Friday for the following week I was booked to work just about every weeknight from 5pm to close and a full shift Saturday and Sunday Ummm In the interview I explained that this was a second job and couldnt start until 6pm and would be willing to work 1 day a weekend I was lead to believe that it wouldnt be a problem as a matter of fact they explained that they had a lot of students on staff and it was likely that I wouldnt get more than a few shifts a week When I brought that up the mangers attitude changed and I was told that I would be expected work when scheduled no questions asked and I was to make this job a priority and I should ask my full time job to accommodate their hours (I suddenly realized why I left retail in the first place) I simply thanked her for her time handed back the product samples she had given me and told her that I would not be returning She was honestly confused as to why I wanted to leave,JoBloGo,16208283840,15

gxosmyr,n9jyqk,Technically day two but still a good one Took a job (actually through a Reddit posting lol) that they said was a Tech/Customer support position Day 1 show up and the place is just this tiny office rented out in this crappy (mostly empty) building Group of about a dozen of us show up for training First off we get told that the week of training is "Unpaid with a Sign-On Bonus" So at the end of the week you would only get paid for your time if they wanted to keep you on Heres Red Flag #1 Next were told we will need to purchase our own headsets that meet a certain standard But of course "Weve got some here that you can purchase from us" for like $90 conveniently Now on to the meat were told the position is pretty much PC Tech Support People will call us because something is wrong with their computer We would have to guide them to a specific website to run a *special scan* for viruses and shit We will attempt to sell them on a "Remote Repair Service" where they would have to give a "member of our Tech Team" remote access to their computer for up to 48 hours to "fix it" and then try to sell them on a multi-year license for an Anti-Virus program for hundreds of dollars Of course the whole pitch was scripted Also our pay would be largely based off of commissions from these calls and we would also be required to make so many sales per week to stay employed I am completely suspect at this point so to put the nail in the coffin I ask why it is that people are calling *US?* Were not a well-known company and we dont have ads anywhere so where are they getting *our phone number* from? **"Oh its just a little prompt that appears on their screen"** So just so were clear: ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT THIS "JOB" IS LEGITIMATE This is 100% a scam right down to lying to the employees about what the "job" is The entire idea is to swindle old people who arent tech-savvy Theyre only calling this number because it was on a pop-up Sell them on some fake bullshit and convince them to give over remote access so all of their shit could be stolen Went home after Day 1 knowing it was all bullshit Came back the next day gave them one more opportunity to convince me it wasnt a scam by telling me where they were getting our number from Got the same bs answer about it being "a prompt on their screen" and I walked out But I then went for a walk through the neighborhood About two blocks away I saw a big "Now Hiring" sign outside a large building Walked inside Found out it was a Staffing Agency They asked why I was looking for work Told them I just quit my job after one day because it was a scam They just said "Come back tomorrow and well find you something" Came back the next day and ended up getting placed in one of the best jobs Ive held to this day I did some digging in the years after and found out the "Tech Company" was shut down later that year having not paid their employees for more than 2 months Also found out the guy behind the whole operation is now working in Real Estate so surely hes not screwing people out of money anymore right? /s TL;DR - "Tech Support" job ended up being a scam to steal money from elderly people Immediately quit and was instead immediately hired at possibly the best job of my life,Synth-Pro,16207027880,13

gxr8v4z,n9jyqk,After graduating high school in Boston I took a "gap" year to go live with my mom in Brazil--because when youre 18 and from Boston who wouldnt want to be a beach bum in Rio de Janeiro for a year? That was my plan but my dad said nope at the very least you must get a job No idea wtf kind of work I would find down there my Brazilian family always spoiled me when I visited so I was just a clueless noob only real work experience was a summer at McDonalds and Id be damned if I worked at McDs in Rio! Anyway I answered an ad for a jewelry store in Copacabana that wanted people fluent in English and got the job on the spot since theyd never met a dual national natively fluent in both languages The gig was weird because I wasnt working at the store They sent me to one of the big hotels on the beach where I paired up with a private car driver who gave tours to visiting Americans The deal was that I would act as interpreter and somewhere along the way we would bring the customers by the shop and I would get commission on whatever they bought On the first day my partner explained that the jewelry shop commission was just the tip of the iceberg He had all the hook-ups If they were hungry he knew restaurants of every type that would kick back a cut If they wanted to drink or dance he knew bars and nightclubs with the same deal Its not like it was illegal per se because this was during the military dictatorship; there were NO civilian police--just didnt exist--and the Military Police the only semblance of law & order back then really couldnt care less (hell they were even worse shaking people down for money left and right) But even that was still just the tip of the iceberg My partner could literally get the customers *whatever* they wanted Drugs? He knew a pusher Whores? He knew a pimp Everyone paid commission--the sketchier the want the heftier the cut But I figured sometimes you just gotta say: "What the heck? Make your move" (*Risky Business* was my only guide for the situation) So little suburbanite mostly-American boy-child me puts on his Ray-Bans and goes into the lobby at what is now the Fairmont Hotel and I just stand there waiting for the concierge to send me a customer Not much later up walks this rotund ruddy-faced American in bermuda shorts and Hawaiian shirt with his straw hat and Docksiders smiling a big friendly smile and pumping my small hand with his giant paw so excited to meet me They told him I was half-and-half; boy was he impressed! Couldnt get over how lucky I was to grow up like that! "I just love it here! The city is so beautiful I come here all the time on business you know" He was from Texas first Texan I ever met "And the people are so wonderful! So happy all the time so carefree" Hard to argue with that it was all true Things were going well so we headed to the front entrance facing the beach Back then Copacabana was a really amazing place to be more so even than now and it was a beautiful day with plenty of people enjoying themselves lying out on the sand swimming strolling the wide sidewalks "And I mean look at how beautiful everybody is!" he continued "I just love Brazilian people These women! I bet you know what I mean"--he laughed and literally nudged me with his elbow and winked "They are so beautiful and free--and young! I mean you couldnt hardly tell by looking but some of those women out there they look all grown but some of them are just like fifteen sixteen And you know its not like back home They dont have the same rules its not the same morality here you know? Its just do what you like!" This was taking a grim turn I was barely eighteen myself I had plenty of cousins in Rio and Sao Paulo who were fifteen or sixteen and all with super puritanical Catholic morality "Well son this is my first trip here without the missus and you know Im gonna take advantage! Yes sir before I go back Im gonna bang me a fifteen year old!" Looking back now all these years later--almost four decades gone by--its hard for me to even believe my own recollection but I remember it vividly Those are literally the very words he said to me I had no idea how to respond I felt ill so I said "Excuse me I have to go to the bathroom" and I walked straight out the back got on a bus and went home Didnt call the store didnt bother telling anyone that I quit I just went home and lay there thinking about being both Brazilian and American and how that could possibly work,thelionslaw,16207561920,9

How is this in any way a comparison for your fuck up buying the first place you looked? I spent three or four hours in total cleaning this old sign up to re use it then fitting the new vinyl on the Saturday I had a window of about an hour on Sunday to help install the new sign on the building between visiting family and working my second job The minute I hesitated by text about being able to help the abuse and reverse psychology started It put me in a shit mood before my 7 hour shift and to top it off we parted ways with him saying After I paid X for the vinyl but Ive seen it elsewhere for Y how about you go back to your boss and ask for some money back and then well split the difference? The cunt didnt even pay me! I completely cut ties with him after that I told my dad about it and it made him see this guy in a different light one that he knew about but had never really witnessed before or chose not to A few months later my dad saw him and he asked how I was and why he hadnt heard from me and my dad bluntly replied because he thinks youre a cunt!

gyb0q9f,n9jyqk,I did an interview for a bakery (big chain actually) with a friend and it was alright Only in the middle of it a girl from my school that I knew came in with her mother to talk to the supervisor and she just left us during our interview to talk to her We sort of overheard that the daughter had worked for them unpaid 3 times and still hadnt heard back about the job For some reason when she asked us to work a shift the next week (unpaid of course) both my friend and I still said yes and I was scheduled to start in the morning Turned out that they only have a few people working there regularly and try to save money by having "possible new hires try out unpaid" and they just fill the missing shifts up like that Anyways I get there and she wants me to prepare the pretzels (this is in Germany by the way) and shows me once how to do it You just spray them with lye solution and then put them on the baking tray with one very swift movement of the rack and they are on Well I sort of overdid it and the pretzels fell behind the counter and landed in DIRTY FUCKING CLEANING WATER that had been used to clean the floor She told me it didnt matter I should just pay more attention next time and proceeded to take the pretzels OUT OF THE DIRTY WATER put them back on the tray and in the oven because "they were getting baked at such hot temperatures no one would even know" During the rest of the shift she continuously cleaned the counter where the food was with the same hand brush she used for the floor and touched all the food with her hands after SNEEZING into them and not even washing her hands My friend had the same experience we never asked about the job again and also never went back there to eat It was absolutely disgusting!,just_anotherartist,16211549380,7
gyhpm5v,n9jyqk,My boss was a criminal and he wanted to pin the blame for his crime on me I had been out of work for about a year because my father had a stroke and Id moved in with him to care for him but he was at a point where he was mostly autonomous again and could do pretty much everything himself just not quite as effectively So I started looking for work One day I get a call from the Job Centre about a placement a local business they tell me It might be "local" but it was still nearly two hours by train Whatever The business itself is one of several run by a guy in Gravesend Far as I can tell this guy does just about everything; builds and then rents out houses owns a mechanic shop wants to get into owning a corner shop There are only about four people there besides myself; the boss-man himself his main mechanic who I only met once and who doesnt feature much his IT guy who I will refer to as Hairy because he was and a girl about my age who was also on a placement So I turn up on monday and the main building is split into two large rooms; the main office and the back office The back office is filled to the brim with random storage there were bikes and random bits of furniture and obsolete electronics around There were two desks in the main office with PCs and one in the back office Immediately the boss asks me if Im any good at fixing computers First warning signs came when I took a look at the PC in the back and its full of viruses pirated music and porn I figure he just picked it up at a boot fair or something I clean it up as best I can and decide the next day to dust out the interior if I can get a can of air I dont know what the fuck Hairy did he clearly wasnt doing much pc maintenaince there though I learned later he was sent out to other peoples homes to fix PCs he didnt maintain the ones at the office I was only actually "at work" for as long as it took to do that but the monday was only meant to be a trial My actual first day would be the following day The second day is when shit got serious Today Im in the main office taking cash from tenants Like actual handfuls of cash for rent payments and updating one of the front-office pcs as these payments come in Theres a bludgeon under the desk What the fuck? Why is there a bludgeon under the desk? Whatever Gravesend is kind of shitty I guess but the safe is right next to the window and you could probably heft it out in the middle of the night if youre determined enough Before I go on lunch the boss-man opens the safe counts out about a grand and writes out the details of a bank account "Here take this go down to the Barclays Bank and pay it in" he tells me Its all rent-money butI have no job Im coming to work in a ratty matalan clothes and he wants to trust me with a grand? Weird butokay I get the feeling this guy is secretly loaded anyway I do that and come back In the afternoon the Boss-man introduces me to his son and asks me to write a letter he said hes been getting hounded by a Solicitor for doing something and he wants me to write an official reply that is to use his word "ballsy" "I live on the internet I can do ballsy" "Great were gonna go out and check up on a construction project well be back in an hour or two call us if you need anything" So I read these letters this Solicitor has been sending and they talk about how the deposit for the properties was meant to be stored in an Insurance fund The boss had not been doing that So I look up the law the Solicitor is quoting figuring maybe it had been repealed or amended and I could bring that up in my reply Nope Still on the books this law is in effect So I have half a typed-out letter written in a combination of the formal businesslike tone I was taught in sixth-form Office Skills WP1 and standard internet asshole and I have no idea how to actually rebuke this guy so I call up the boss figuring maybe he can give me some pointers "Hey so Im writing this letter" I say to him "and Im doing some research so we come across as knowing what were talking about andyou realise this is actually illegal right?" "No no its not its not something anyone actually does" "It doesnt matter Illegal is illegal Can you not just open a security fund now with the money?" "Oh the moneys gone" "Well can you not open one with some other money? I watched you take two thousand pounds in rent yesterday and their deposit was only five hundred and just a few hours ago I paid a grand into the company account" "Oh that moneys gone too" "Huh I see thats why you wanted ballsy" "Now youre getting it Oh and when you finish sign it" "Do we have like a company signature or-" "No you you sign it" "Me? Why?" "Because you wrote it and I want it to look like were all one cohesive team Say we did this say we know the law but its outdated and nobody follows it so its not something that will ever stick I have to go" -click Write a letter wherein I essentially admit that breaking the law is nothing and to personally sign it? It sounds like hes asking me to create evidence incriminating myself He had given me a thousand pounds early in the day and told me to go down to the bank and pay it into an account There was security footage of me at the bang with a handful of notes and he wants me to admit that their deposit money is gone? Hes gonna blame it on me in court Fuck that Hairy is in the office with me I havent seen the girl again I hope she had more sense than I did and got the fuck out of dodge on day one I tell Hairy Im leaving "Where are you going?" "Home I quit Fuck this Im not admitting to a crime for a job where Im not even getting paid" "What do I tell the boss?" "Stop pirating MP3s and dust out the computer in the back" "About you I meant" "Whatever you want I dont care but I kept note of the details of the couple coming after him if I so much as smell his aftershave Ill go to their solicitor with everything I know about this place and the ability to testify under oath that the boss knew he was committing a crime Bye" Hairy must have called the Boss because Im barely at the train station when I get a call from him I repeat the threat tell him Im done and tell him never to contact me again I go home call the job centre get myI want to say "providors" e-mail the person I met with to sign on every other week and I sent them an explanation of why I was quitting this placement They never questioned it or sanctioned me for it but they never put me on a placement again,Veridas,16212851500,8
gxok9we,n9jyqk,Worked the nightshift at Strack Van Till Grocery store Not because I needed the money but because I was a night owl and had nothing better to do My assignment was overnight shelf stacker The process involves pallets of food to be staged at the end of the aisles We would take the food and stack it in its appropriate place in the aisle My first task was to take the small cans of cat food and stack it Easy enough until my supervisor inspected my work and took all the food and put it in the box and retrained me it seems the Purina whiskers needed to be aligned perfectly Fair enough I re-stacked the cat food My supervisor once again inspected my work She proceeded to inspect every can I did to ensure I did it correctly She found one slightly askew but overall I did a good job She then took all the cans and made me restack it again I was upset but it wasnt the end of the world The end of the world came during our 15 minute break Everyone congregates in front of the store to smoke cigarettes or drink some soda or water I wanted McDonalds so I started to go to my car to make a quick run My supervisor saw this and asked where I was going I told her and she responded that I am not allowed to leave the premises I told her I am going to McDonalds because I am an adult A coworker sensed what was going on and asked if he could finish my soda since he knew he would never see me again I went to McDonalds and then pulled into the parking lot looked at my supervisor ate my burger and then drove off Best Job I ever had,SilvercoreLegacy,16206982110,28
gxookv5,n9jyqk,EMS company First job after getting my license I had to meet up with my ride-along in a parking lot He was late and the boss was calling me grilling me for not already being on the ambulance I kept telling him I couldnt find the guy Maybe I could check inside the hospital? He kept yelling "Dont you go in there Dont you dare" Eventually the guy showed I had to help him get new tires for the ambulances They were $17 a piece because they were second-hand tires from a ridiculously home-grown looking tire garage Essentially truck tires for $17 dollars They looked worse than the ones we were taking off almost The whole time this down-to-Earth EMT was telling me how depressed he was The job was killing him It wasnt the patients it was the company the boss the environment He kept telling me the other guy we worked with was super-loyalist to the company and not to share any of this so I respected that when I got to ride with the other guy Went with other guy for a fast run dropping someone off Then we came back to the EMT room wed be spending the rest of our 24-hour shift in We were in an abandoned wing of the hospital very sketchy looking and smelled moldy and disused Our room had two bunk beds with mattresses with literal holes in them and old stained hospital bedding He talked about all the times an ambulance had broken down how he had to fix all the mechanical issues himself how there wasnt a better company This was it If youre an EMT youre like this and you enjoy it I bailed after the first night I wasnt sure I wanted to do this anymore for a hot minute but I applied some more places People told me to go back there and get that job back chew through the fat etc Literally the next day I got a call and another company told me to show up at 3am Wasnt sure what fresh hell this would be Stayed there for almost a year until I got a way better paying job but this one was already several $/hr better pay and my partner was actually my tablemate from EMT school Way better ambulances better boss chill crew every day Some of the patients were a riot others heartbreaking cases but some of them we did a little extra for and it made a big difference Id say it colored my whole healthcare worker experience and if I hadnt tried to become a hospital admin Id probably still be in healthcare Hospital admin was too depressing Going from caring for people to pushing caregivers to hit quotas is a feelbad move I learned that I dont actually care that much about money beyond a certain point but I do care about how I spend my day,Carpaltunnelsnake,16207005220,6

gxqi20b,n9jyqk,Technically not quitting a job more like walking out of a scam It was a giant waste of a couple of days so Ill throw my story in here/ Circa 1992 when I was a college sophomore a friend of mine and I were invited to interview for a marketing position at a job fair on campus Day of the interview we went to the address which was empty office space above a strip mall in town Maybe 20 other people were there as well to interview I went in for the first interview which was with this college-aged student about my age It was like 30 years ago so its hard to remember but it was very low-key No though questions people skills type of stuff She was very sweet and bubbly After we all interviewed she comes back out of the "side office" and we found out who got second interviews which would be commencing immediately My friend wasnt called for a second interview but I was I told him Im more than happy to leave We both agreed something seemed really sketchy so at the very least hed stick around while I did this interview to find out the scoop So I go in This tine its a dude in his early 30s Although they were vague at the job fair and at the first interview I find out about the "job" Dude pulls out a set of kitchen knives The infamous Cutco knives and says Ill be selling these Im like what do you mean like in the mall or something? No its would be to family friends dormmates Classified ads in the newspaper (this was before the Web was a thing) Im sort of pissed at this point as he explains how he sells his knives but the kicker was that he said in order to "accept the position" I had to buy a set of "demo" knives myself for $150 (in 1992 thats like almost $300 in todays money) So I said no and just left I remember my buddy sitting there when I walked out of the room and telling him it was basically a pyramid scheme and that they probably saw me as a rube TL;DR - Wasted two days of my life pursuing/interviewing for a Cutco "job" without realizing it,SmokyDragonDish,16207450790,5

gxxcgui,n9jyqk,I was fresh out of college looking for a marketing job I had just quit my last job due to a harrassment issue and was desperately needing money for rent I applied to a job that described itself as "direct marketing and advertising" for a charity I thought cool I can finally put my diploma to use and make more than minimum wage I get there for an interview its in this swanky modern office downtown The company was a small start up by this young guy from another province and he wanted to grow the company to have another branch in my city This area only had maybe 7 employees They had me do some bonding exercises with them which isnt abnormal but they were VERY enthusiastic about it They were very enthusiastic about everything Everything was a reason to be excited Even the fact that my pen matched my shoes This made me a little weirded out but I thought they were just /really/ into their work They take me out on a trial run Im shadowing one of the younger guys who has been there for a couple of years Its not advertising Its going door-to-door in "rich" communities aggressively trying to get people to sign up for monthly charity donations using a pre-written script that is NOT to be deviated from And not taking "no" for an answer even if it means you have to stand there for an hour saying the same shit over and over again We went to one house where it was clearly a single mother with three kids She opened the door and was obviously stressed and looked absolutely exhausted My shadowee started his spiel and when he finished she told him she couldnt sign up because she had been laid off He ignored her and then went on to compare the price of monthly donations to "Starbucks trips costs" and how she could "help herself by helping others" She closed the door in his face He then told me as we were walking away "I hate people like that theyre obviously lying and dont care about the rest of the world" Like Bud??? We break for lunch Im super uncomfortable because all I can think about is how absolutely dangerous it is to be going door-to-door especially solo (they never worked in teams not even the women; they were expected to coerce complete fucking strangers into spending money ALONE at these strangers HOMES) They seem completely unbothered still abnormally enthusiastic Then they tell me that in order to get paid I have to invoice them They dont give me any paperwork or tell me how it works how frequently they get paid or what to do about taxes Just "you have to invoice us for your hours" Im just sitting there thinking "wtf?" After 4 hours of shadowing Im sent off by myself to "Make Changes to Make Someones Life Better" Alone In a neighbourhood of a city that I do not know With the rest of the "team" in different areas at least 10 minutes away I have a panic attack call the nearest coworker and said there was a family emergency and book it to the nearest bus stop I later texted the boss and said it wasnt a good fit and I was uncomfortable trying to coerce strangers in their own homes to spend money and he said I was "doing a great disservice to the world" and would "never find a real marketing job as good as this one" Im good fam Fuck that noise,kingbambi5000,16208682160,6

They would just say they would call back later So they would and wed repeat that conversation The first day went relatively okay but day two I was overwhelmed That day my manager also pulled me aside to tell me off in a very angry tone because I hadnt asked her if I could do anything for her She knew all the work I was doing during this but implied that I obviously hadnt been doing anything at all if I wasnt constantly asking for more work The rest of the week didnt go any better as it all just kept piling on Then I was told I had to take my laptop home and continue working for free for the entire weekend keep my phone on keep the laptop on and dont you dare miss any emails for more than five minutes Keep the office Skype up I was a very nervous underexperienced and naive kid It stressed me out so bad I spent most of the final days of that week shaking and trying not to come to pieces in front of anyone It doesnt sound like there was a lot of work but God There was so much I stomached half a day the following Monday before just asking to talk to my manager in private and told her I cant handle Im not who theyre looking for and Im leaving She told me I clearly needed to have more confidence but fine And off I went I dont want to imagine what a month would have been like there,The_Reclusiarch,16207473850,6

gxr3upn,n9jyqk,A friend had gotten me a job as a bus boy at the restaurant he worked at On my first day me and my friend walk into the restaurant about two hours early so I can introduce myself and learn the basics I introduce myself to the manager who has a really pessimistic and bitchy attitude As she is complaining about how much the job sucks I go to adjust my glasses on my head She goes "alright youre already off to a bad start Never touch your face in my buisiness its a health hazard Go wash your hands Soap AND water" I could understand why touching your face would be an issue during dining hours but the place wasnt opening for two hours I didnt even touch my face I just pushed the wire on my glasses up and my job was literally picking up dishes and washing then all night long I quickly realized was how poorly the place was run which surprised me because it was generally considered very fancy (one of those places where you have to make reservations a week in advance) As I start working I realize how poorly organized and managed this place is All the chefs hate each other the waitresses all hate the manager everyone is rude to each other and half the food is microwave and immensely over priced Also employees did not get a free meal or even a discount meal before the restaurant opened which is kind of a common courtesy in the restaurant industry As the night starts the manager retreats to a quiet empty room to watch netflix The waitresses make me not only do dishes but also get people food and serve alcohol (which was illegal because I am under age" It was complete unorganized chaos and I was thrown into it with no direction while getting scolded non stop You might be thinking that every restaurant is like that You are right None of this is why I quit During the peak hours of the night I am carrying a huge tray of dishes into the back to wash As I am walking into the back kitchen area I notice a hundred dollar bill on the ground A bunch of the chefs are pointing it out as well It is between the kitchen and dining area with the corner tucked underneath a floormat so somebody had probably dropped it I go and dump the dishes into the sink walk back to pick up the bill so I can give it to the manager in case somebody lost it but it is gone now Whatever I assume who ever dropped it picked it up (lots of foot traffic in this area) Later in the night my friend tells me that a waitress lost a hundred dollar bill so I tell him I saw it earlier My manager comes up to me and asks if I have it and I say no it was gone by the time I unloaded the dishes She walks away and I think it is done Nope She comes back up to me 20 minutes later and says "if I find out you took that money I will make sure your night ends in jail" I say "well its a good thing I didnt take the money" and I show her my wallet and empty my pockets to prove it Also they have cameras everywhere so she could easily check for herself The manager hates me at this point and as it turns out she has told all the waitresses not to trust the new guy Everyone assumes that I stole the hundred dollars As the night comes to an end the manager decides not to pay me and says she will "think about it" in the next week I reply and say that I will "think about showing up again to this shit show you call a restaurant" I do not show up for my shifts My manager calls me and asks why Im not showing up I tell her I dont appreciate the way I was treated and she can find a new bus boy The end And it was a chef that took the money,wetpankobreadcrumbs,16207541520,3

gxoufct,n9jyqk,Back in the late 80s I got hired doing customer service at a professional photo lab I had bad feelings about the job even as I accepted it The manager who interviewed me wasnt very friendly and seemed like a total burnout case; she told me that some of the photographers could be very difficult and demanding so I would need to be able to handle that while remaining professional They also werent willing to offer me anything over their minimum to start even though I had some photo/darkroom experience (which was described as a "plus" but not mandatory in their ad) But mostly it was the depressing vibe of the place that raised red flags for me I still took it because I didnt want to do face-to-face retail; it offered me a chance to learn a lot on the job and could maybe lead to a better photo-related gig On my first day I arrived and met three women who had been there in customer service for varying lengths of time Two of them had been there at least a decade and one for just a few months but all three had the same depressed and downtrodden look the manager did There was also a guy about my age (21) who was starting that day Nobody said hello to us or smiled--they didnt even greet each other Us newbies spent the morning learning the workflow how to write up orders--basically paperwork--while the others anwered the phones and handled the occasional pickup or drop-off at the front counter In that three-hour period I saw the youngest of the three women burst into tears after hanging up on a photographer who shouted at her over the phone so loudly we could make out most of his ranting from 20 feet away She had to get up and go into the restroom to get herself together and the other women just sighed and rolled their eyes at that When she came back out she sat at her desk looking utterly defeated The phone rang She didnt pick it up right away and one of the long-timers barked at her "Are you going to get that? Ive got my own job to do you know" And that was when I knew I couldnt do the job Its bad enough dealing with shitty customers But when your co-workers shit on you too? Forget it On top of that the guys who did all the processing treated the customer service reps like shit They just had terrible attitudes Theyd come out with a question about an order and be really rude and shitty about it And as for management they were all upstairs and there was a very upstairs/downstairs vibe about the place I never even saw the upstairs; I filled out paperwork when I arrived and the customer service manager carried it up I made it to lunchtime then went to the manager and told her the job wasnt for me and I wouldnt be back She just sighed said "Suit yourself" and that was it; she didnt even try to change my mind I left and headed for the bus stop While I was waiting for my bus the guy who started with me showed up; hed quit too We laughed for a moment about how terrible the place was; his bus came and that was it Ive had some shitty jobs since then but at least I had co-workers I could commiserate with or favorite customers or understanding bosses or made decent money Sometimes I got all of those That place--god it was like where souls and all semblance of humanity go to die it was that bad,Cats_Ruin_Everything,16207038380,2

gxov9wh,n9jyqk,Back in the 80s I took a job selling encyclopedias (World Book) door to door If you dont know what an encyclopedia is it was basically Wikipedia on paper before we had internet - and it was expensive Anyway I went door-to-door in a suburb on the outskirts of civilization It was a couple hours from where I lived so my new supervisor drove us out there in his car I was to share a motel room at night with three other sales people but I never made it through the first night I was sent out on my own to walk a neighborhood and try to convince people with very little money to make years worth of monthly payments on a set of encyclopedias that would probably be obsolete long before they were done paying for it Its kind of an insane business model when you think about it Anyway it was a 10-hour day of one rejection after another but two moments stand out The first event was actually not even a house It was a trailer surrounded by a picket fence I walked through the little gate with my sample and sales materials in my hand As I approached the door it opened on its own and a Doberman pinscher came running out all snarls and barks and teeth I turned immediately and ran for my life toward the gate I knew I didnt have time to open it so I hurdled the fence Thank God the dog didnt follow me but I am confident he could have made it over easily if he chose to make the attempt Same day a little while later after I had recovered my wits a bit I walked up a driveway to an actual house Similar to the Doberman trailer before I could get to the front door the garage door opened and a woman emerged pointing a shotgun at me and telling me to get out of there As slowly and carefully as I could I backed away hustled down the street and I was basically done I found a pay phone and called my girlfriend collect (again pre-modern technology) She and her dad drove the two hours out there to pick me up and bring me home I figure thats true love so I married that girl We have been married 36 years now,Moosie_Doom,16207043450,2

gxovz67,n9jyqk,Door-to-door canvassing (in this case selling" memberships to a political organization that actually I thought was pretty decent) In the pre-lunch shift I was recognized as not being determined enough so in the afternoon the supervisor took me under his wing as we went door-to-door together as a pair The first house we went up to he told me "now as were going into our spiel hand the person the clipboard That will make them open the screen door Then do NOT take the clipboard back from them until you have a subscription" So the person who answered turned out to be a nice kind little old lady in her 80s She trustingly opened the door to us and--when the supervisor handed her the clipboard--she opened the screen door and took it Then my supervisor went into his spiel She listened patiently for a long time (though clearly needed to sit down but didnt want to shut the door on us out of politness) and kept trying to decline us politely but firmly (She didnt have the money for things like this; etc) (it was clear she didnt) She kept trying to hand back the clipboard but that bastard would not take it *Her hand started trembling then shaking* And the bastard still would not take the back that clipboard He was not going to take it until she signed up He had a point to prove (finally bless her heart at the end of her strength she opened the screen door further bent down and gently set the clipboard on the ground) As we walked away from the house I felt like shit I wish I could say I quit at that moment but they had driven us to the target neighborhood and I needed the ride back Still at the end of the day I said I quit (I even said "this feels wrong to me" which did not go over well) I was a starving college student and needed the money badly But fuck *that* No one needs money that badly,DerProfessor,16207047740,2

gxowvw8,n9jyqk,My first ever job was working in a fish and chip shops in my hometown I got the job through a friend who had started working there at weekends; I was 14 and wanted some pocket money since my family were struggling and I basically never had any money for anything At that age it was literally the only job I could get - I went around for a week asking places if they needed extra workers but nobody would hire me because I was too young This place was kind of a shitty one compared with most of the others along the seafront - it was small and kind of delapidated but it was situated really well and got loads of foot traffic It was owned by a guy and his wife who were constantly arguing like having SCREAMING matches at each other for most of the day You can tell they despised each other but they were staying together for the sake of the business The smallest thing even a minor misunderstanding or mishearing what the other person said could blow up in seconds There was no training or anything theyd just bark orders at me sometimes asking for different things and getting annoyed that I didnt do their thing first I was young and naive and didnt ask about how much Id get paid - I knew my friend was on 5 an hour which seemed pretty good to me at the time and I assumed itd be about that I worked my arse off for the whole day eager to impress but nothing I did was good enough They knew it was my first job they knew theyd given me no training at all but theyd ask me to do something and then shout at me for doing it wrong (which was usually just me not doing it the way they did it but made no difference at all things like how to wipe a table down correctly) Some guy dropped a 5 while he was walking past and I ran out to pick it up and give it back to him Took all of 30 seconds When I got back I was scolded for deserting my post My post was literally bussing tables At lunch it was rush hour and he asked me to take over at the order counter I grabbed a pencil and a piece of paper so I could write down the dishes for the larger orders before relaying them to the cook (sometimes thered be 10+ things in a single order being given in a totally random order) The guy came over midway through taking a large order grabbed the pencil out of my hand and threw it on the floor and then in front of a queue of 25 people berated me for being too stupid to remember the orders and remember what everything cost without having to look at the menu for reference (it was my first day but somehow I should have known what everything cost straight away) He blamed me for messing up the order and confusing his wife who was doing the cooking In reality my method would have worked just fine it just wasnt the usual way they did it because theyd been doing it for decades and knew everything by heart Anyway the rest of the day continued in similar fashion basically just being treated like a piece of shit who couldnt do a single thing right The whole day I was just thinking about how I was at least getting paid Id at least go home with some money During quiet moments Id go wipe down tables or refill things and be calculating in my head how much money I was earning per minute and counting down the minutes until I could go home End of the day came I helped to close up and asked about getting my pay for the day He paid me at a rate of 250 an hour which was well it was nothing When I asked how come I was only getting paid half of what my friend was he said it was my first day and apparently it was just a trial and the pay would go up the longer I worked there and proved myself Wish Id told him to get fucked but I took the money and caught the bus home The cost of a small snack on the way home and the bus ticket was about a third of my days "earnings" Not ashamed to say that I cried after I got home Id tried so hard and all Id gotten from it was a whole day of being treated like an endentured slave and then coming home with next to nothing My parents asked me how my first day of work went I told them about it and they just kind of laughed it off and told me welcome to the working world thats how all jobs are this is a good life lesson for you etc He called me a couple days later asking me to come in the next day I told him it wasnt worth it and he should find someone else to torture He went off at me screaming and swearing at a 14 year old and then hung up before I could reply Every time I walked past that place after that I gave them the ol middle-fingered salute Even if it was closed which it usually was Edit: I just looked up the place on Google Maps for a laugh and it has a 1 star rating from 3 reviews Sounds about right,kinggimped,16207053310,2

I ordered 20 minutes ago" I basically tell her Im not in charge of making the orders and this is my very first day She wanted a refund so I told her I would go grab the manager to help facilitate her refund The manager is talking with the lady and the manager asks "who took your order?" the lady points at me and the manager writes my name down She ends up telling me later that the refund is coming out of my paycheck THEN proceeds to complain that I shouldve ALSO been making the orders I was taking (just the blizzards and drinks) Is there not a fully functioning and staffed kitchen?

Im doing deliveries!" Now Im pissed I talk to my manager again and he reveals that they needed a line cook more than a delivery driver and they saw I had experience before working at McDonalds and figured I would be ok doing line cook work I told them no because I applied for driver specifically because I dont like doing line work or being in the kitchen because I get very dizzy and have a hard time breathing He than tells me its too late now because the position of driver was filled by that new person even though they originally hired me as a driver But then he bullshits me and tells me they hired me as "crew member" meaning my duties were flexible and I would do a lot of different duties including driver but they didnt need me for driver The next day I called Im and told them i quit for a job that hired me the position I actually applied for but that was a lie to make the look stupid Technically not a first day quitting but still the quickest I ever quit a job TL;DR- I applied at a restaurant as a delivery driver was told I got the job started first day as line cook instead saw they hired someone else as delivery driver was told they hired me instead as a line cook Quit after day two,Brim_Dunkleton,16207107140,2

Buns cost money!"* She pulled the bun out of the trash and put it back on the table* I finished the shift and went home I called her and left a voicemail that I got a better job offer and I would not be back I wasnt *that* desperate I also called the Sacramento County Health Department and told them about the roaches and gave them the DQs address I didnt get paid for the four hours but I didnt GAF *(for those of you who are not aware if you see even ONE roach on the floor in daylight it means a MASSIVE infestation)* *I chucked the hot dog bun back into the trash when she wasnt looking,JohanBroad,16207112960,2

gxp6f9e,n9jyqk,Back in 2012 I moved to NYC right after graduating college without a job for the heck of it Despite hearing about how hard it will be to find a decent job in the city I was surprised to find that a company had contacted me so soon for an interview for a marketing position The interview process was very odd first of all there were A LOT of applicants in the waiting area Second the place just seemed so chaotic Everyone was running around and I remember feeling like there were just way too many people for the space Anyway I walked into a room and met with the interviewer who was a nice lady She asked me some basic questions and after about five minutes she told me that I had passed and that I should come in for a second interview (At this point I thought that this is way too good to be true? Or did I just really rock this interview?) I was confused but I became even more confused when she told me that I should wear "comfortable shoes" when I come in the next day as I will be shadowing one of their employees for the entire day She gave me no other information Being the young inexperienced stupid naive girl that I once was I decided not to think much of it and I went to work the next day wearing my comfortable flats I was introduced to a young man around my age (maybe three years older?) and he told me that we will be making a trip to Queens and that our goal is to convince people to change their energy provider I thought "ok He must be giving a presentation or something to another company" and I followed him Once we arrived in Queens he took me to this sketchy neighborhood and proceeded to knock on the doors of all these houses He basically told me that we have to "trick" people into showing us their energy bill and tell them that they are paying way too much Before they take the bill away we were to quickly change their energy provider to (I forgot what it was called) using our tablet We did this from 10am-6pm Going door-to-door There were people slamming their doors in our faces but wow he was so persistent After a rather exhausting day we went back into the office and I noticed that there were people in teams and huddled around a big gong Yes a GONG I was like ????????????? From what I can see I think there were teams competing with each other and the winning team was celebrating by ringing the gong The whole situation was just so bizarre Anyway the young man took me aside and told me that I did a good job and that I was hired I turned him down politely and said that this just isnt what Im looking for I left and never looked back Obviously this was a little door to door scam and apparently some people make decent money off of it but I felt like they were just taking advantage of newly college graduates The funny thing is my job search continued and I fell into their trap AGAIN This time the interview was at a different building but I knew something was wrong when the interviewer told me to wear "comfortable shoes" for a second interview I noped out of there so fast,Ribbonlover,16207120380,2

Im like yeah? He is like cool lets take your car At this point Im trying to act cool but Im wondering what is going on So we get in my car and start driving and I ask where we are going?

gxpaw82,n9jyqk,A little late to the party but I hope some of you find this entertaining I got hired as a data analyst for some media company I was a naive young lad and shouldve known the red flags before starting Firstly the interview took about 25 hours The guy who found my resume and wanted to hire me talked my ear off He meant well but nothing was technical about the interview I basically listened to him talk about himself for a whole 25 hours I maybe said about 10 sentences and that was it Secondly the owner went from having 100 employees all the way down to having 2 employees The guy that hired me and his accountant I gave him the benefit of the doubt but I shouldve taken the reviews on glassdoor more seriously The owner wanted me to work for free and since this would have been my first legit data analyst role I took the job to get my foot in the door Little did I know for the next 8 hours the following day my ear almost fell off by the guy that interviewed me I wanted to be kind and I tried to listen to the guy but I also wanted to get some work done so I could impress the owner It wasnt only the guy talking my ear off but the owner did not have any internet He used some phones as hotspots and our PCs had to connect to them I gotta tell you that was tough He told me that the owner should be getting internet soon but the interview guy did not believe the owner Again I gave the owner the benefit of the doubt The only work I did do that day was essentially transposing an excerpt of what the owner wanted to post I modified the excerpt in word docs and it took me about an hour to do When I showed him the document he thought it was the best work he had seen ever It was honestly a joke because all I had to do was basically write down what the owner told me to write down and make it look pretty After the 8 hours he asked me if I could come in to start the following day because of the great work I did with his excerpt I come in the next day and lo and behold the guy that hired me and spoke to me in my interview did not work there anymore and another new guy started with me I introduced myself to the new guy and we chatted for about five minutes I went to sit down at my desk and the accountant gave me my onboard paperwork that I needed to fill out and give back to the accountant to verify The owner was a pet-friendly employer so he brought in his poodle that day The poodle followed him everywhere I digress as Im walking down the hallway I hear the accountant yelling I wonder who he could be yelling at? I come to find out that hes yelling at the new guy See the accountant was not fluent in English and the new guy had a couple of questions about the onboard paperwork The gist of it was that the hourly amount he was promised was not written in the offer letter The accountant was yelling and yelling and said to deal with the amount that was offered and to give him the paperwork The new guy eventually just left the room while the accountant was still yelling at him He looks at me and just says "what" I had a similar question regarding the offer letter and all he said to me was to deal with it and to sign the paperwork as quickly as I could At this point after seeing how the accountant was treating the new guy the guy that hired me not working there anymore and the internet I wanted to leave but I first wanted to talk to the new guy to see his side of the story As Im heading down the hallway I see the owner walking down the hallway and his poodle following close behind As soon as I pass the owner without hesitation the dog pounces out and bites me really hard in the leg Enough to leave a nice bite mark I jumped back in a surprise and yelled no at the dog because he went to go bite me again The owner just slowly turns around and tells the dog to get back He explained to me that the dog didnt know me and was being protective He didnt even ask to see if I was okay I was a little shaken up and said Im going to go finish my paperwork This was the moment I realized I should NOT be working there anymore I spoke to the new guy to get his story and he felt the same exact way about the workplace I told him the situation of how the accountant treated me and how I was just bitten by the owners dog I told him Im going to walk out and not look back I dont even care if Im not paid This place was scary to work at and I wanted no part in it He said that he wanted to stay a little while longer so he could get paid because he needed the money Fortunately I had enough saved up so I could walk out Without even telling the owner I walked out On my way out I spoke to the accountant and returned the onboarding paperwork saying Im no longer interested in the position He started to say "You HAVE to sign it or you cant be paid! SIGN IT! SIGN IT NOW!" I simply and calmly said "no thank you Im not interested in getting paid Good luck to you and thank you again" He continued to yell at me as I walked out the door Later I texted the owner saying that I will no longer be working there and that I had gone to the urgent care to check on the dog bite The owner begged for me to come back and promised to not bring the dog in anymore and to not allow the accountant to yell at me and the other new guy He was desperate He really wanted me to come back and tried contacting me a few times over the next hour but I did not respond to him because I did not want to deal with his desperation I experienced enough and started to reread the glassdoor reviews about this guys business I guess the owner had an even more explosive temper than the accountant Im glad I did not experience that It was a scary work environment it did not feel welcoming at all The internet the lack of employees all the yelling and the very aggressive poodle was not a good combo Also I came to find out that the new guy who had waited patiently for his check did not receive any money The check had bounced and he was very upset I believe he went to civil court and won the money back but geeze am I going to take glassdoor reviews more seriously now,NSWCSEAL,16207157490,2

gxpg7b7,n9jyqk,My boyfriend (at the time) and I were desperate for work We were 18 and living on our own for the first time in what amounted to a shed with concrete floors on a farm that belonged to his friends sister We resorted to Labor Ready probably the most bottom of the barrel staffing company in the US We had to wake up before dawn to drive to this place and stand in line for daily labor assignments One assignment was at a small local printing company Their equipment was old very old Like the kind you read about decapitating people and ripping off limbs because there are giant cast iron moving parts with no covers or safety features whatsoever Let alone affording new safer equipment they didnt even have a machine for doing tri-folds on pamphlets so thats what we were hired to do So we sat around for 6 hours folding pamphlets Mind numbing but not the worst work at least we got to talk to each other while doing it The owner seemed like a decent guy and we were tired of job uncertainty and having to get up at 4 am to wait in line every day for assignments so when the owner came to us asking if wed like to work full time for him under the table we agreed The next day we came in and did the work expected of us but when the time came to pay the owner gave us less than what we would have made if wed just stuck with Labor Ready which was already the federal minimum wage of $525 And we were doing this guy a favor because he had to pay double that per hour for us when he had contracted us out from Labor Ready! About $11 or $12 an hour with half going to the staffing company The least he could have done was pay us minimum wage We made this insult clear to him and he grudgingly paid us the rest of the money but we never went back,lonelydad33,16207206290,2
gxpgbus,n9jyqk,I went through about 7 interviews with a big life insurance firm didnt want the job but needed it I needed to get certain licenses for the job and they wanted me to pay for part of it I didnt have the money at the time but I planned to just do it and hope for the best On the first day in I get a traffic ticket for driving over the median I had stopped at an ATM which of course was out of service and then got stuck on a one way road going the wrong way so I drove over the median and got caught Ended up with a warrant for that ticket as well because the city was transitioning to a new website but had both websites on the ticket so I picked one and paid it and it was 50 cents too short- so I get a warrant Fuckin sweet Anyways end up going in telling them I couldnt get the money that day so they showed me around assigned a desk and then I sat in on a sales meeting This job was commission based with a small draw I had enough cash for the month but the next month if be homeless After I left I got a call from a brokerage firm They offered a job with hourly pay something like $17 an HR and an increase after training I immediately accepted and never formerly quit the other place just never showed up again lol That was a good move they ended up having unlimited overtime and I took advantage of it by working 16-18hr days 7 days a week for a yr I also got to eat 2 meals free as an award for racking up so many OT hrs So I managed to pay off all my student loans save for a 2 week vacation and save enough to buy a house that first year I then promptly quit after that vacation ,usedtobebroke,16207207500,2

gxphrb7,n9jyqk,Worked for a company that basically was a subcontractor for charities Day one go round to several houses and do the door to door glad handing give us your money type thing Now we could only accept donations via card so we had to basically get them to agree to go on the phone to our processing centre while we were in their house My partner and I get invited in to a house by an elderly gentleman who seemed all too happy to have someone to speak to Warning one: We notice pictures of grandkids so my partner who was training me informs me to mention how if he donates he can receive a pack with a cuddly toy in it for the grandkids He mentions he never really gets to see them anymore because he doesnt get on with his son well to which my partner says "I mean hed love you all the more if you had a toy for them" Warning two: "I mean Im just not sure about if Im actually helping the charity Like you know how sometimes they subcontract so Im just paying someones salary and none of the money helps the cause" My partner quickly jumps in to say "Oh the entirety of your donation goes straight to the charity so you know youre helping!" Now this is a blatant lie in this case because our company upon receiving the donation puts it into a pot because they did a single large donation each end of month to charity Warning three the Im out: We finally manage to manipulate the wonderful man into making a donation He opts to make the maximum donation a one-off donation of 12 My partner informs him we just dont have the facilities to set up recurring payments from a donor so we usually redo the same areas around once a month He informs me hes looking forward to helping out again to get the other variety of cuddly toy for his other grandchild After weve left my partner takes me to a coffee shop nearby where we get on the phone to report our success on this guy The company lets us know that because the man made the maximum donation we each receive 29 for the sale They ask if he went for the one-off or recurring to which the trainer says he did a one-time and because he never asked if we do recurring payments he didnt need to be told This was a lie Company says that if he makes another one-off we get the same again In my head it finally lines up The 29 is for every person we sign up We get told to do one-offs every time and tell people we dont do recurring donations so we sign up the same people every month for their donations and receive more pay for each donation than their donation I get told that its ok because the charity fits the bill with the subcontracts So for every 12 we raise for this charity we charge them 29 and ensure each time we lie about recurring donations that the company receives more money from the charity than we supply to the charity,XPC-Reaper,16207221220,2

gxpmdw0,n9jyqk,I worked 1 shift at Micheals last summer It was just a part time job I already had one job and was looking for some extra money so I only needed a few hours a week On my first shift the woman training me messed up a transaction so bad and then yelled at the customer about it so then the customer asked for our manager (as they should) and the manager pretty much told them to shove it and walked away They were furious by the time they left and I had already decided I was quitting after that but I finished out my shift There was extremely noticeable tension between the employees to the point where they were fighting with each other over the headsets while on register Plus all the stuff I was expected to do by myself was ridiculous they wanted me to ring out all the customers answer the phones zone and stock all the merchandise around the cash wrap take online orders out to the cars and clean Which like I have worked retail for a long time so it wasnt surprising But that coupled with the coworker drama and the fact that it was only $9/hr made it pretty clear it was an awful work environment I knew more about what I was doing on my first day than the woman training me did and shed been working for the company for close to a decade!

gxpqfoo,n9jyqk,NYC 2004 Im 22 Worked with a girl handing out flyers on the Upper East Side She asked me if Id be interested in working at an auction for more money I needed the money and agreed to go with her after our shift We arrive in midtown Manhattan at some jewelry store where they are set-up for auction I am led to the back of the store where this Joe Pesci looking guy is waiting for the girl and me There are two additional people back there and as the four of us are standing in front of the guy he starts pointing at us individually and assigning us to individual fingers Either a pinky or a thumb on either the left or right hand Im confused at this point until he goes on to explain that he is the auctioneer and that he needs to sell his goods at a certain price When he is calling out the bids ( "do I hear $2000") if he had the finger you were identified as you would bid to raise the price Then he explained that in certain "lots" there would be more than one piece of jewelry and depending on the price he may want other people to buy some of the lots For example he has 10 of the same watches if he gets the price high enough he would have you buy the minimum amount so he could sell the rest He would indicate how many lots to buy based on the direction he held the ink side of his pen Down was the minimum to the side was half and pointing up meant to buy all the lots Oh and last rule dont look at each other So at this point Im feeling very uncomfortable am pretty sure this is illegal but also a bit scared to leave due to the serious mob vibes Im picking up So I go back into the area where the auction will take place and sit down as the right pinky The auction starts and it doesnt seem as official as what youd see on TV There are about 30 people including the four of us As we get going he uses me to bid up some diamond necklaces but I dont end up buying any of them Hes using the other plants as well and at times we are bidding against one another even when no one else is bidding Most people seem interested in the watches that are being auctioned Rolex Patek Phillipe Omega and some others I had never heard ofbut would def be bidding on as the right pinky For some reason he starts leaning on me a lot with the watches Im not sure if the others are fucking up or Its some strategy of his One of the watches was over $90k and he has me win that bid along with about $300k in additional watches At this point a lot of people are looking at me some impressed but most are confused because I am dressed like I should be handing out flyers After about four hours of auctioning things wrap up and the guy pays us all $40 cash He invites me to another auction later that week and I tell him Ill have to check my schedule I leave the jewelry store and he never hears from me again TL/DR: I worked as a fake bidder in an auction for some unsavory individuals,lloydoring,16207301590,2

Thats what I was told Id be doing and its what Im best at" He just laughed and said itd be better if I continued to understand the layout of the store so me working the cash register wouldnt be happening anytime soon I never showed back up for the job I called in the next day told the manager on the phone (another manager who had no idea who I was btw) that I quit got sent a check for that 11 hour day like 2 months later and they never asked for the suit back So cheers to that Zara for a $120 paycheck and $500 suit after a very mentally taxing day,Magicgun23,16207304940,2

gxq0gqk,n9jyqk,Not first day but 3rd day I needed a part time job to supplement my full-time income so I went to the McDonalds across the street from my apartment wearing a suit and handed the manager my resume He clearly felt I was over-qualified and acted like I might be playing a joke on him but I convinced him that I just needed a convenient way to make extra money near my home after I got off work from my other job He hired me on the spot and even said he would pay me an extra dollar an hour because I spoke English (foreshadowing that I didnt realize) It turns out that guy was the daytime manager but I could only work night shifts When I showed up to my first shift he wasnt there nobody knew I was coming and almost nobody spoke English They stuck me in a mop closet with a computer to watch training videos all night Second shift they found one probably 16-year old kid who spoke English to help train me so I spent the first two hours working with him in the drive-through where I had my next big revelation 50% of our customers didnt speak English either and my trainers shift ended I was by myself running the drive-through trying to take orders in Spanish unable to communicate with the manager or any of my coworkers and utterly wrecking the productivity of the entire operation It was a nightmare I showed up early for shift 3 so I could catch the daytime manager before he left and told him that I was willing to work my shift if they needed me but it was quite clear that speaking English may be a bonus but speaking Spanish was a requirement and I couldnt do it He understood and I quit before my 3rd shift Note: If anybody thinks me privileged youre right I had another job already that gave me the financial ability to quit I know not everyone has that luxury If anyone thinks Im racist or xenophobic notice that I didnt say anything negative about anyone I didnt fit in their well-oiled machine Not the other way around I only wish that they had been clearer that English was not the language spoken by employees,LibertyEqualsLife,16207368000,2

gxqkpg9,n9jyqk,A little different kind of a job as an extra in a Hollywood film Had an older roommate who made extra money on the side as an extra in movies/commercials etc The film Cinderella Man with Russell Crow was being filmed in Toronto and he told me they needed lots of extras for the fight/crowd boxing scenes They converted the inside of old Maple Leaf Gardens to look like the inside of Madison Square Gardens I was told to be there around 7:3O am wear a black suit white dress shirt tie etc I get there huge lineup fill out your information have to pass inspection of the makeup crew and told where to go Some people like even street kids given haircuts borrowed jackets ties etc so they could get a shitty cheque For whatever reason they put me in the wrong line thinking I was a union actor So I ended up 15 rows from the ring and every take (rows sqattered with fake dummies) I was so sit on the seat wait 5 seconds get up move to another seat so in the movie it appears movement in the crowd Majority of the extras would make up one giant section on the side The scene was Russel Crow slowly walking into the ring crowd is silent where some woman yells out "you can do it Jimmy!" Well after 3 hours of the same take extras are getting restless especially in the one main section of extras just there to collect a cheque Its around the 15th take the woman yells out the "You can do it Jimmy" and an extra yells out Rob Schneider style "all night long" Laughter erupts Russel Crow loses his shit demands a microphone in the ring and just goes off on a rant Kanye West style tell everyone how its Hollywood and how they should be grateful etc fucking unreal!!! Time for lunch and was given a can of pop a sandwich which consisted of cold piece of chicken a bun slice of tomatoe and some lettuce and an apple all while being crammed together like in a chicken coop Also its was one of the hottest days of the year and no AC in the arena as it was the old NHL arena built in the 1920s After lunch we had to reshoot similar scenes but this time I was sitting amongst the crowd and I can see why one would be restless this dragged on for 4 hours Another break and then all the extras ushered into one giant section Ron Howard comes out gets in the ring they have a special camera to shoot the crowd and Rons asking us to pretend the Leafs won the cup so everyones getting rowdy or leafs lose so we are all booing etc That dragged on until 10pm I got home at 11:30 pm and was exhausted A few days later I went to the agency in charge of the extras and was given a cheque for around 135 bucks the woman asked of I had an agent cause she liked the way I looked I said no but I saw her write something on my paper Two days later I got a call of I was interested in being in a Pepsi commercial where they needed extras Fuck that I said no! It makes for a great story but the way they treat people like theyre next to nothing shit pay shit food yet expect you to be all perky for 12-15 hours is ridiculous!!!! Maybe the Pepsi commercial would have been different who knows,OMC78,16207462120,2

I trimmed those things like I was about to serve someones granny because I was! there were about 2 dozen serviceable berries in the whole produce box a cig-drenched cook came in from his 15th break of the day to holler at "the idiot in the back" telling the chef I am wasting food I was expected to do their dirty work to use up garbage they forgot about so the owner didnt notice the waste I was expected to do this and I assume they had me do it in case someone got sick?? they moved me to dishes until lunch and yelled the whole time!! Lucky for me it was JELLO SALAD day and a kitchen sink sized buffet tray was brought out I saw them make it Clear jello tomato sauce tomato juice soy sauce and diced: carrots onions peppers and tomatoes While it sat up in a sink full of ice I kept doing dishes I was much younger and less assertive and the best I could think of was to look at that jello salad just long enough to need to turn and self induce vomiting into a wheelie trash can and wheel it out with me and never come back I left and was broke so did go back for my money!! I asked the guy if they had gotten the shoes and he said "We didnt plan on ordering them until you had been here for 2-4 weeks" and said something like "We cant have people just wasting food all the time back there we have a business to run" at which point I told him I would hate to stand in his way and he might want to check the freshness of stuff in the cooler occasionally This job was followed by another: Dog kennel straightforward job but not only did they hose dog excrement into a stormdrain that looked municipal but on the first day the owner shrilly screamed at the top of her lungs at a girl for "Letting a dog out of the gate" but not only was it a super dumb giant dog but it was the owner who let it out!! she berated this girl for 5 full mins red in the face and left while we checked all the dogs out the employee told me the woman had gone to a conference on how to get rich having a doggie daycare in FL it explained why their "daycare lunch" room was double stacked unmatched rusty dog crates with broken trays were were expected to crawl in and clean without removing the trays or moving anything It also explained why on my second day when I came in to open with the girl no one showed up with a key the girl had enough and let me have her job I didnt have the key but when I called to report I had no way in the manager accused me of knowing the girl was going to quit and told me if I knew that I should have gotten the key from her She told me to "STAY AND ACCEPT MORNING DROP OFFS" and the first customer said she wasnt sure the boss wasnt going to leave me outside with 25 dogs on leash locked out indefinitely said she would take her dog to work I thought it over and at 725 at the time being the only employee for this woman in that shithole was not the next step in my "career" they are still always hiring I guess people dont tour the facility to see the rusty cages!! Other kennels were smelly too of course but the only problem I had at another was being expected to poke call or even spray the dogs if they laid down too long??? I was told "customers pay for our service to see their dogs playing and if they dont see their dogs playing sometimes they call and complain" I quit that job based on that It helped that the manager lived in the building in an office in an industrial zone I would still work a full month at all these places before returning to amazon again in any capacity Peak season there in winter is fine I can risk my car in the snow but no AC in the summer nagging on water and bathroom breaks limited equipment for no reason and "manual sort" like ants during power outages when we cant see our feet on the floor NOPE if you hurt yourself at they have a huge sales pitch make you worry about losing your job and offer you "in house treatment" which should be illegal if it isnt,IttyBittyJamJar,16207471250,2

gxqoz7c,n9jyqk,This was quite some time agoearly 2000s but I wanted to get started as a financial advisor and took a job with Primerica at the time it was owned by Citigroup which made it a reputable company to me I had some questions during the interview process and it really felt like a multi-level marketing company and I had even asked questions about it potentially being a pyramid scheme but was given a number of answers that made me comfortable enough to proceed I knew I had other options if this didnt work out so to be honest I really only put one foot into this new job at this stage I then reported to the office for my first day and was given assignments to write down the names of my friends and family members and told to make this into a call list that I would start calling on the next day to ask them to entrust their investable cash with me and Primerica I went back to my new boss and asked where the training materials were related to SEC regulations training for my series 7 and series 6 exam and he said that all comes laterthat first I needed to get new customers I pushed back and explained that the last thing I am going to is to call my friends and loved ones and ask them to give money to me (a completely untrained person who was NOT a financial advisor) and my new company who I have not seen operate as a financial advisor in any way shape or firm since arriving at the office or during my interview process He pushed back that we bring them in and then Ill learn I handed back the materials and told him that I have no desire to be part of a company that asks an employee to convince their closest family and friends to entrust their retirement and financial future to an individual with no qualifications or experience to do so and a company who provided me with no evidence they are qualified to do so either I definitely threw out the terms pyramid scheme unethical and a complete and utter waste of my time I moved on and have had a nice career in finance and thankfully never crossed paths with anyone who uses that firmto be fair I have no clue if they currently operate this way anymore and know they went public and are no longer owned by Citigroup,filibustermonkey,16207480030,2

gxr0q5h,n9jyqk,This one still haunts me to this day I was fresh out of college back in 06 and wanted to make my way into IT specifically Desktop Support I visited a staffing agency who seemed impressed with my go-getter attitude and even picked up the phone mid-interview to ask one of their clients if they might have a role available Sure enough they did! I was instructed to show up at an address on the opposite side of town the next day to report for "work" Upon rolling up to where my MapQuest print outs led me I stumbled upon a trailer park and cautiously walked up to the front door of a double wide A gentleman at least 400lbs greets me and has me walk into what appeared to be his home/office He gives me a quick rundown of what he does how many clients he travels to support each day and his personal backstory I was told up front that this is a training day and I only make money if I do the actual work which might take a few days before he feels comfortable sending me out on my own - naive post-grad me thinks "Hmm okay Im in this for the long haul" He then asks me if I am okay working with a homosexual and I tell him I do not see why that would be a problem I have gay friends and a progressive outlook on things "Great!" We jump into his small car (he was a BIG guy) and he starts off on his daily route At first everything seems okay - I immediately saw how he was taking advantage of these small businesses (fixing things that did not need repair or exaggerating the problem) which set off my ethics alarm He later justified it that he tries to get a minimum amount of work done to support the cost of gas Hmmmnot great but okay The day goes on and he starts telling me stories about his ex-wife and how they both got morbidly obese together He made a lot of money off the tech boom in the 90s and lived an extravagant lifestyle He realized he was gay and his wife left him as a result By this point I was already feeling pretty uneasy - internally debating if there was going to be a day two In the late afternoon we pull back up to his trailer and he asks me to sit down at a repair bench in the back of his house He walks me through a few troubleshooting scenarios on a clients desktop and then mentions it will probably be a week before I can go out on my own He gets really close to me and starts rubbing my shoulder I tell him that its time for me to head home as I did not get a lot of sleep the night before He then asks me if I want to stay the night at his place That way I dont endanger myself driving tired! I noped the hell out of there I dont even know what excuses I made but I remember him saying well pick back up where we left off tomorrow I got back home and my parents excitedly asked me how it went My face must have said it all I told them what happened and they were not surprised when I said I would never go back The guy calls me the next morning asking where I was - I explained I realized PC support was not for me and thanked him for his time,Lostprophet48,16207528780,2

All happy go lucky like nothing had ever happened We would never find out why he sent the email No one wanted to ask just in case there was a can of worms to be opened by doing so so we would all just go about our week like normal and just wait for the next berating email/communication from him The money was good so I put up with it for a few years but I saw many supers come and go because of the precariousness of the situation I finally had to quit when I realized how much it was affecting my family life I didnt realize how tightly wound I had become and how not fun I was to be around I learned an important lesson after my time there Never let problems to be solved and money to be made become more important than family to be loved and time to be enjoyed,jmedi11,16207539200,2

gxrgllq,n9jyqk,I was low on money while living in Manhattan so I tried to sell some of my basically worthless jewelry in the diamond district The guy said that no one was going to buy my shit but if I was that low on money I could have a minimum wage job passing out fliers in front of his business which I took him up on For people not familiar its basically a block in midtown where every business is a jewelry/diamond dealer A lot of the shops had flier people and there were also some teens running around from shop to shop I quickly discovered that they were pickpockets (They were very open about it) Theyd steal jewels from inexperienced sellers then sell the jewels to the dealers for a discount One poor sap came up to me and told me he had a diamond to sellwould my guy give him a good price? (I had no clue) One of the pickpockets sidled up and asked to see it I wanted to warn the guy but somehow in that moment I became complicit and said nothing This idiot had a diamond worth 10s of 1000s just wrapped in a crinkled piece of paper which he handed to the thief The thief oohed and aahed pocketed the diamond then handed the guy back the crumpled paper He didnt even check The thief sold the diamond to my employer and the would-be seller ended up sobbing in the street because that money was supposed to go to his wedding Thats when I quit and I still regret not stopping the theft,themehboat,16207593570,3
h5evvj0,olgt7p,Source: My Wedding Well start three days before The wedding was a ren-fair style wedding outside at a large gazebo and the Maid of honor had promised to purchase a stylized dress for my bride that they had agreed on THREE DAYS before the wedding she calls to tell us she had no money and was embarrased to admit itso we literally hand-sewed ont together in 24 hours IMO it turned out pretty nice for what we had Brides mother was supposed to pick up the cake in ATX and drive an hour south for the wedding She left her house 30 minutes before the wedding to pick it up When she finally showed up (hour late) the cake was DESTROYEDshe put it in the back seat and drove like hell all the way down just slamming it against box with every turn During the one hour delay there was almost a fist fight between two groomsmen becausewell the MoH showed up IN THE DRESS THAT SHE WAS UNABLE TO AFFORD Obvious attempt to upstage the bride The same MoH during her speech after the ceremony started it of by saying When we all met I did not like Drakkarim411 at all however I found that he grows on youlike a fungus Needless to say my entire side of the family was super cold to all of this Since all of these issues were on her side of friendships or families I was told to suck it up and well discuss later I sort of assumed that a lot of these friends had just shown themselves the door Quite the opposite In fact two years later when I accepted my first well paying job out of college it became an issue that it was an hour and a half out of Austinso she decided to just stay in ATX to be with her friends I mailed her the divorce papers and since she couldnt be bothered to even show up to the hearingIve never seen her again,Drakkarim411,16264526760,872

h5egknj,olgt7p,This wasnt specifically a "wedding moment" but rather a "reception moment" Heres the basic background information: The couple in question had been married on some tropical island or another and since the majority of their friends and family hadnt been able to attend the ceremony they had decided to throw a "lavish" party upon their return This had prompted the pair to spend borderline-absurd amounts of money on what might very well have been the tackiest celebration Ive ever seen Imagine renting out the cafeteria at an elementary school then hiring a celebrity (who happens to be a half-blind orangutan) to decorate it Commission the services of an expensive caterer but require them to serve only the sort of slop that youd find at a low-rent county faire citing the fact that "nobody likes fancy crap" Finally enlist a disc jockey whose idea of an appropriate "first dance" song is "Freaks of the Industry" by Digital Underground Im exaggerating obviously but that really was the song that they chose Now everyone has different tastes and it might seem reasonable to assume that the newlyweds were getting exactly what they wanted That was what I had been telling myself anyway until shortly before the "money dance" (the announcement of which was the first time that Id ever even heard of the tradition) when I overheard a suggestive piece of gossip: The couple had apparently already argued about the amount that had been spent on the reception with the bride claiming that the whole thing was a disaster and the groom insisting that it was "classy as fuck" He had been so certain of this in fact that he had used his new wifes credit card to pay for it She had reportedly been rather upset when shed found out about that and had temporarily kicked him out of the house which had prompted him to stay with an old girlfriend *Something* untoward had allegedly occurred during the mans exile but details were lacking and his spouse had decided to forgive him That was already bad enough but the the rumor  at least as I understood it  was that the aforementioned "money dance" was supposed to help them recoup their financial losses with the implication being that the future of their marriage was riding on them receiving upwards of thirty thousand dollars in a four-minute period As I considered all of this and as I mentally added up the amounts being pinned to each partner I found myself thinking "Yeah this isnt going to last" **TL;DR: Grifting groom gets grabby gormlessly gambles gaiety**,RamsesThePigeon,16264461100,2490
h5fl2af,olgt7p,This is a story I posted on r/entitledparents a while back I have edited it slightly to add a few details and I assure you that every word is true I would like if I may to take you on a strange journey This is a tale of love betrayal narcissism casual racism and in the end mind bending insanity Several years ago a friend married his girlfriend We all decamped to a beautiful part of the UK for the wedding and all seemed to be fine and dandy until THE SPEECH The father of the bride ostensibly a pillar of the community stood up to do his speech and by God did he make the most of it He kicked off by presenting us with the old adage children are the future as if it was some amazing new concept that he alone had the insight to appreciate He then immediately dropped that thought to praise his daughter her stepmother and especially himself Much of the time was spent detailing how much money he had spent on the wedding and how much work was involved on his part Yay him The best bit was when he drew our attention to the cake and also to the receipts relating to its cost that he had framed and put on display next to it After a full hour (no exaggeration) of this bragging and self praise with no mention of his new son in law or his family he suddenly seemed to remember his intitial theme declared once again that children are the future like a fat white Whitney Houston and announced that he had a treat later for all the kids who were there He then left the room to applause from his close friends and family and bemusement from everyone else Half an hour later he reappeared Dressed as an Arab sheik To top off the look he had blacked up with boot polish He called for the attention of all who had not yet become transfixed by the sudden appearance of something out of one of those Two Ronnies sketches that dont get included in compilation shows any more He then informed us that as children are the future all adults present should show their appreciation by giving each and every child present 2 There were around 30 kids in the room so every one of us was apparently expected to give away 60 in loose change that we all had in our pockets to kids that most of us had never met He then led the kids in a conga of capitalism dancing around the room like a fat racist Fagin stopping at every table so money could be extorted Under the pretext of needing the loo I decided bugger this for a game of soldiers and managed to escape to the bar where the 5 or so I had in my pocket remained safe Hooray for debit cards It wont surprise you dear reader to learn that the marriage didnt last long (a little under four months) and that the whole charade appears to have been a calculated attempt to take my friend for half of everything he owns with the father apparently having prepared paperwork for the divorce prior to the wedding In the end this ruse failed and she left with a token pay off of a couple of thousand pounds Here comes the craziest part Brace yourselves All that has gone before pales in comparison Once the divorce was underway my friend no longer felt bound by the vow he had made not to reveal his in-laws oddest secret which he gleefully revealed to me They genuinely believe themselves to be the earthly form of some kind of pan-dimensional rabbit beings I believe that the official term is Otherkin No offence to any of their fellow believers out there but youre a bunch of loonies At weekends they travel about the countryside in search of their cotton-tailed brethren whom they approach and converse with They then head home and relay the information gleaned from the field agent bunnies to a pair of small rabbit statues that stand on top of an upright piano and are presumably some sort of interdimensional comms device Needless to say I think my friend had a lucky escape!

She was pregnant with his kid? I think she must have felt like she had no other option There is a kind of happy ending for A She later met this kind older man named B He actually made good on his promise and helped bring all her children to live with them at a beautiful ranch he had built Things were really happy for 2 years until As youngest--the child she had with Stewart--was diagnosed with brain cancer and passed away before her 7th birthday Still B was the best person to be there for her during that time Stewart did not come to his daughters funeral,mangagirl07,16264628500,69

h5hk6tz,olgt7p,A cousin (that Im not close to and dont particularly like) was getting married His bride bought 3 wedding dresses in the year leading up to the wedding Partly because she gained weight but also because she just decided the dress wasnt actually "the one" and so a whole new dress should be bought Then she complained non-stop about how her parents and his werent spending enough money on their wedding They ended up spending somewhere between $75-$100k but nothing was good enough She refused to send invitations out as a form of protest to not getting everything she wanted "Give me more or there wont be a wedding and all your deposits will be wasted" Because she delayed invitations by MONTHS for a June wedding a lot of people declined because they had already book vacations or whatever So she made a photocopy of the invitation and had them printed at Walgreens and sent out reserve invites 2 weeks prior to the wedding trying to get more people to come/send money My mother and I got the second round of invites Notable because that entire side of my family is my mother and me (as well as my husband and kids) my grandmother then my cousin and his parents (Neither of us attended nor did we want to but the 2 week prior invitations just felt rude af) According to my grandmother on day of the wedding the bridal party alone went through 3 kegs before the ceremony The groom and groomsmen stood around the keg drinking in view of all the guest until the actual ceremony started which my grandmother just found very tacky Theyre still married but I feel like it is more for show They each spend holidays with their own families and dont see each other and they both go on vacations without each other He works 70 hours a week too Its only been 2 years but I think theyre the kinds to torture each other for eternity than admit to making a mistake,KimLizLaw,16265006110,13

h5hj0n2,olgt7p,This was 20 years ago but Ill never forget it My ex girlfriends sister was getting married I slept over my girlfriends house the night before the wedding In the morning at the house the day of the wedding the bride to be pulled me aside clearly upset She gave me a piece of paper with an address and asked me to go pickup her fianc I asked why doesnt he drive to where hes got to be or take a cab The hotel or wherever I was just 22 She told me he was here and still drunk I said "oh" I drove over and knocked on the door A girl my age answered in a bath robe I was like "uh is Mark here?" She said hold on He came to the door in underwear and shirtless He clearly didnt want to get married and I was surprised the bride to be even knew where he was I quickly decided not to convince him to come and get married but just blurted out "dude youre going to miss one hell of a party! Open bar is going to be awesome!" He looked at me for 15 seconds without saying a word then said  "ok" I drove him to the hotel where he was suppose to be in the first place I went back to my girlfriends house and her sister thanked me for getting him back to the hotel to get ready I asked her straight up why? Why you want go through with this? She answered "because its my wedding day I dont give a shit what happens tomorrow but this is my wedding day" It lasted 2 weeks What was really astonishing is that fact that a lot of people gave her money directly and not in a common envelope for the bride and groom in the cash wedding box My ex girlfriend was in the wedding party of-course I was not So I sat at the misc table and got hammered with an Army Ranger who was flying solo that night That guy could drink let me tell you We made the best of it and played drinking games using the center piece that ended up in the fountain,MIT-engineer1979,16264997570,13
h5hzteb,olgt7p,I use to DJ weddings and I have a few stories but theres one that definitely sticks out I had to meet with the couple before the wedding day to go over the details of the reception and these two could not agree on anything It was clear they both had entirely different ideas of how they wanted the reception to go and despised the ideas the other one had The brides mom was with them though and she was a Karen on a whole other level so naturally the brides plans won out The day of the reception the only time I saw them together was for dinner and a few photos During that time all they did was fight with zero regard for their visitors It was really weird though because nobody acted like they were troubled by it maybe this was so common people didnt even bat an eye to it anymore So after dinner and all the formalities are done the bride spends her time in the reception hall with her guests while the groom is out in the parking lot getting absolutely shitfaced with his guests The best part was when the wedding photographer asked the bride if they could get a couple more shots of the couple she went out to the parking lot to get him only to find he had left an hour or so before Dude bailed on his own reception and didnt let anybody know Suffice to say that was the end of that party And no this wasnt some low class white trash group of people They came from money I think the brides dad was a doctor if I remember correctly Either way that marriage is/was doomed,Sturrux,16265140180,13

h5hmoyw,olgt7p,My wife was invited to be the maid of honor at her best friends wedding For months she slaved over the planning and execution of nearly everything involved It was for a lesbian couple both worked under my wife in the same company for years One of them was noticeably out of her mind crazy and I couldnt stand her The other was pretty chill! I had chosen to not attend even though I was invited simply because I cannot for the life of me stand the one bride I mean shes bad Like the kinda person you cant be within 10 feet of for more than a minute without losing your mind Well the wedding was being held at the crazy brides mothers house A HUGE 10 bedroom disgustingly large house They of course invited their closest friends 5-6 of them most from the same office to come over and hang a few hours before the wedding was to take place So they all showed up including my wife the maid of honor 4 hours before the ceremony Well! None of them came dressed up! Including my wife So an hour or two before things were to begin they all decided to go get dressed up and the mother DEMANDS they all leave and go elsewhere to do it as it would somehow be unlucky for them to dress up in the same house as the brides???! And the bride of the crazy mother says nothing Deer in headlights kinda look on her face All of them being an hour or more from home all ended up getting dressed up and doing their makeup in a 711 BATHROOM switching out with customers as it was a single room She told me it was beyond embarrassing Then to make things worse the mother demand that my wife their maid of honor not be standing near them while they were saying their vows but rather pulled up an extra chair into the room at the very back behind the guests where she was to stay seated for the entire ceremony I was LIVID! A lot of my own money went into decorating n whatnot As well as a nice expensive gift! Ack! My wife ended up making the nearly 2 hour drive home later that evening crying the entire way In the end they moved in together December of 2019 right after getting married With covid they were house bound and couldnt escape one another They divorced in August of last year after hardly 11 months The really cool one of the two brides ended it saying they were better as friends than lovers That the other was "insufferable",Gunslinger1814,16265025050,7

The wedding march song started playing and my aunt went: "See? The bells are telling me (she sang this part) Dont marry him dont marry him hell cheat on you haha" I was as much perplexed as a kid by it as I am now 2) We has chickens at the time and my mom set up a joke for our gift the reception explaining to me that the groom liked "pretty girls" So we made an announcement that our present also contained pictures of "beautiful chicks" obviously we gave him chicken pictures we laughed he didnt He looked genuinely disappointed that his arousal was for nothing and his wife wasnt one bit surprised by his reaction She looked kinda sad and used to it They divorced not too long later (maybe a year or two) after he repeatedly cheated on her spent tons of money on gambling and terrible business ideas made debts in her name and even got the police to smash their door in the night for some illegal stuff hed been doing which the police believed she was involved in as well Yeah all around a POS no idea why she was with him in the first place But I was too young to be told this stuff back then and I wont reopen wounds now by asking My mum told me aunt still wakes up some nights in a sweat reliving the trauma of policemen smashing their door invading every inch of their home and interrogating them deep in the night,SuperRoby,16264820010,6

Groom: What for? Bride: Me and some friends plan to go on a girls day out on (x date) Groom: But thats our honeymoon? Bride: Is it? Can we reschedule?

h5hdh0g,olgt7p,A lot of this is red flags leading up to the wedding but theres a pre-wedding moment that caps it off Long story incoming One of my best friends (Well call him Clay) was getting married and it was not a good situation Hes a really kind-hearted guy but unfortunately she took that as "easy to manipulate" and she (well call her Whine) complained about *everything* I could go into stories about how we got him a ticket to a major sporting event she wanted to go we didnt have any other tickets so she tried to guilt him out of going because "hell be there having fun and shell be sad and alone at home" Or the numerous times she tried to force a "joint bachelor/bachelorette party" to which all of us said "fuck no" Or the fact that she invited herself to join one night we were playing games spent half of it in the other room by herself and then came around the corner *in my own house* and yelled "SHUSH!" She literally forced him to bring her then complained the whole time about how loud we were being Still its the night before and the wedding itself that stands out I already was considering talking him out of marrying her after she was being rude to him at the rehearsal dinner and we found out she snapped at his grandmother for no good reason at all Clays grandmother is the kind of woman that would bake you a pie and then talk shit You dont fuck with her shes the best Whine was pushing me to say where we were going for his bachelor party (at that point an escape room and a barhe didnt want to go anywhere that may upset Whine) and we realized it wasnt because she was being friendly and curious she was trying to go too Hell no Went outside to smoke trying to figure out how to be the bad guy that says "please dont marry this woman" and a long time friend of mine walks out Then another Another Were all really uncomfortable about the situation smoking drinking our beers Another friend comes out and it gets quiet for a second before he just drops the bomb "SoClay shouldnt be getting married right?" It got to a point that Clays mom came out we shut up and she even dropped on us that she wasnt for the marriage Offered to give us however much money we need "if we can make sure Clay doesnt show up for the wedding tomorrow" We tried Went to the bachelor party and suddenly Whine is texting and messaging all of us trying to manipulate info out of anyone that she could We realize shes doing this and make a decision to turn our phones off Meanwhile one of our friends who was helping her with her bachelorette party said she was going ballistic because she "didnt know where Clay was" and "wanted to join us" and "it was supposed to be a joint thing" We havent even gotten to the bar we were in the Escape Room We had taken Clays phone and she sent endless amounts of messages demanding to know where he was said she cancelled her party because she was so upset and he needed to come back We spent all night trying our best to talk him out of it all the way into the next morning When we found out Clay showed up to get ready we decided if he was going down we werent letting him do it alone One last conversation with the groomsmen and he was ready to walk His mom pulled the car up to the door outside the dressing room Family and friends all were watching to see how this would goand his dad walks in and goes "Hey bud why not go through with it and if you decide its not for you you can always get it annulled" I have never seen a murderer born in a moment but the look on his moms face was probably as close as I was going to get We literally had every groomsman and even some of the bridesmaids saying "dont do this" Family was begging him not to do it but he didnt want to hurt her So we went out for the wedding and she was shaking We thought it was wedding jitters which would make sense Nope She stopped shaking when the "if anyone objects to this marriage speak now or forever hold your peace" line was dropped and no one spoke up I think she thought (rightfully) that someone would object She immediately became calmscary calm like watching a murderer get a not guilty verdict But when the pastor continued you could tell where the family and close friends were in the audience by the deep sighs of disappointment She spent the rest of the wedding giving him shit for the night before making him feel guilty for not coming home because she "needed him" so on We thought he was stuck for life because if all this didnt stop it nothing would but he thankfully was just done with it all after about a year or so because people stopped inviting him to things and when they did he spent most of the time embarrassed by her actions Ive never seen so many people object to a wedding though and while so many of us wished it didnt last at all the night before and day of were some of the craziest red flags against a marriage that I had ever seen,heartstringsdev,16264959150,6

h4i9gmc,og6dcv,I was riding my bike to high school one day I came to a corner in which a white BMW was rolling up at the same time I was I look at the driver he looks at me and since I technically had right if way I keep moving (stop sign fir him no stop sign for me) Apparently he didnt see me because right as I was in front of his car he started moving pinning me under the car as he turned onto a busy street with me still under the bumper of his car I was pounding on the hood and yelling my head off at him and somehow got ahold something to throw at his windshield and it was either that or the older lady still on the sidewalk who at some point also started yelling or both that caused the driver to stop This took place in a matter of seconds and over a distance of about 30-40 feet and resulted in my bike being totalled but luckily it absorbed the majority of the impact and prevented me from going under the car The dude was terrified and extremely apologetic which was good He gave me his information and his license plate number and explained that he was trying to get to his dissertation meeting at UCLA His parents were quite well-to-do Chinese business people as far as I was told so when we asked for just money to pay for a new bike and for bills they paid it But being under that car was the most terrifying experience in my life and now things just dont scare me that easily,illmakethislater,16257717130,2
h4iezot,og6dcv,Just happened at the end of May this year I was going probably 40-50 km/h on a \~25 pound bike down a narrow path that leads behind houses in a suburban area where I live One of the streets the path bleeds into is a very dead one -- meaning very rarely cars could ever be found on it -- and on the other side of the road was a curb with small ramp that led into the continuing path Whats worse is the end of my part of the path had hedges on either side essentially rendering my ability to react negligible (basically just a blind corner) So my dumbass figured "Im going to go as fast as I can and get some sick air on this bike" I remember right before entering the road thinking there better not be any cars on this road and lo and behold a car showed up All I remember personally was seeing the car everything was black I remember clutching my abdomen and stomach and waking up on the grass whining (not crying somehow but just like groaning in pain) The driver and passenger of the car came to me I was actually in shock so it took me about 5 minutes to even realize what happened or where I was I took off my sweater and propped it behind my head laid flat out not moving for the paramedics to check me out with no problems Took to the hospital pumped full of Morphine Thankfully nothing is broken no concussion no bruises no cuts just scrapes on my knees I wasnt even wearing a helmet According to witnesses (the driver/passenger of the car) I hit their driver door smashed their window and dented it heavily flipped over the car along with my bike landed on concrete and crawled over to grass all in the span of about 15 seconds All I remember was seeing the car and being on the grass I dont have to pay for the window and in return I wont be contacting any insurance boys to give me money for "injuries" If I was half a second earlier Id have been placed in front of the car with the car itself probably going 50 km/h Again no helmet so Im not sure how I didnt even get a concussion I do know I smashed my head though since my earbud had blood on it when I hit the side of my head and it speared my inner ear The only actual injury was my arm everyone thought it was broken but doctors say the bone was probably just bruised and a bunch of muscle torn I couldnt lift my arm past halfway up for a couple days by 2 days after the accident I was walking fine and now just about a month and a half later it basically never happened,TAWIDY,16257742470,2
h4iv2b9,og6dcv,I still do not understand why I did not die on that day It happened when I was approx 8 or 9 I went for a walk with a friend I lived at the time in a part of a city in Russia where you more than often could stumble into a death trap like packs of feral dogs running around or open manholes pedofiles that try to lure you into cars with candy and other unnerving things that would give STALKER a run for its money So on that day we were walking around outside surrounded by big sowjet building block houses and decided to enter one As far as I remember my friend wanted to visit his buddy and invite him to go outside with us We went up the small stairway onto the first floor The door in question was right before me My friend was standing a couple of feet behind me I was looking for a doorbell Usually there was always one near the door frame But there were only a couple of wires with exposed ends hanging near the door My friend who was still standing beside me looked up at those wires and told me that they are maybe connected to the bell that was now missing (child logic) I told him that I remembered that someone I knew used to connect a pair of wires at his door with his hands and therefore "activated" the doorbell Now to be clear those wires were really big Also they were hanging pretty low so I was able to grab them each one with my hands Next step was to get them to connect to each other I expected them to be flexible but those wires were really hard to move This was more a reason for me to try and force them to connect Just a little more only an inch left next thing I remember was a feeling of someone hitting me with something big and heavy across the back I screamed let go (!!!) of the wires and looked back in anger expecting seeing my friend with a bat or a stick Of course there was no bat anywhere Instead I saw him getting up from the floor Just a moment before I grabbed the wires he was standing behind me Now he was more than 10 feet away I asked him what the hell was going on and why he hit me Then I saw confusion on his face and he replied that he was suddenly pulled back and did not know why and by whom There was no one besides us two in the hall After that we rushed back outside and never talked about it After all those years I am still not sure what the hell exactly happened but I suspect that there was some electricity involved It must have been low voltage I guess or else me and maybe my friend would be both dead,Necrion,16257817620,2
h4j0fii,og6dcv,I was playing Club Penguin during our computer science class with the rest of the class instead of paying attention to what the teacher was saying and suddenly he decides to see how are we doing with the homework So he starts looking at everyones computer and I panic so when I try to close the game I accidentaly close the HTML thing (the homework) and put Club Penguin in full screen Now I lived in a very strict family and my dad already beat me multiple times for things like being to loud at eating chips or buying a book with *my* money (because couldnt waste my money in trivial things and instead I had to be saving it so I could repay them for all the things my parents did for me) so I was genuinely scared that he would beat me to death Like honestly I thought I was going to actually die the teacher would tell my parents and they would kill me Thats when I had the great idea of turning off the computer and pretend it was an error the oldest and simplest trick in the book I dont know if the teacher took pity on me thought I was a good student and I couldnt have done that or he was just dumb Either way the teacher didnt tell anything to my parents and I lived to see another day,Anrai_97,16257843650,2

Thats just silly I remember a deep tone of sadness I felt like my fianc was going to hate me for totaling his car It was a very clear thought that floated in a dizzy eerie silence "He will hate me he wont have a car anymore" I honestly dont know how I had the good luck to not hit any of the cars in the four lanes of traffic I spun through like a murder-top I also dont know how I had the bad luck to get knocked into the one 20m wall when at least a km in either direction of that wall was a harmless landscaped slope The Cox truck drove away My car struck the wall corner-first The frame went from rectangle to parallelogram It totally absorbed the force All the noise came roaring back in and I could hear all the cars going by through a bunch of crazy cracks and split bits all over the frame I covered my ears and cowered away from the wind vortex suddenly spinning inside my car The trunk wouldnt close The hood wouldnt close The doors wouldnt close I was cowering against the wheel pressing towards my chest Nothing seemed real One does not easily adjust to sitting in loud fast traffic with no escape route I felt like a grape in an empty bean can that got tossed off a mountain staring out of the busted off tin can lid into the sunny wilderness stuck in a loop of wondering if I could still pop this late I was fine I apparently went into shock but nothing(on me) was broken The cops called my fianc and told him what happened The first thing out of his mouth was begging them to talk to me pleading to know I was OK I was ashamed I thought hed think of the car first He was suuuuper lucky He had good insurance and they threw 12 grand at him like it was nothing Apparently even though the insurance company denies a lot of claims for lack of proof they dont make you prove shit on hit and runs from Cox trucks It happens so much that they just believe you and approve payout instantly Bonkers He bought an even better car than he had for 11k and got to keep a thousand,False3quivalency,16257916740,2

gzva767,nnj3w7,Im paying it forward because I know what its like to be on the receiving end of unexpected kindness - (especially kindness that demands no reward): I was riding my motorcycle once and knew I was low on fuel but decided to try and make it home rather than detour to the petrol station Bike started stuttering so I flicked the fuel tap to "Reserve" - only it was already there and I ran out completely about a minute later My dad had showed me how to lay the bike on its left side to let a little more fuel into the carb so I did that and got maybe another half mile down the road Trying it again didnt help I was fully out of fuel about 4-5 miles from home on a quiet country road Bloke in a car pulls up next to me with the window down and says "No fuel?" and I said yes he said "Wait there" About ten minutes later he comes back with a Jerry can hops out the car without a word and pours maybe 2-3 litres in the tank Says "I saw you laying the bike down for fuel Ive had to do that before" so he knew what the problem was before hed even pulled up I offered him money but he held up his hands and said "Just pay it forward" then got in his car and drove off I have no idea who he was but what he did was just so damn nice! Not only did he take the time to help me (around 20 minutes or so) he spent his own money to get me some fuel It really helped me in a sticky situation and gave me a strong sense of community feeling for the first time This happened around 2012/2013 yet still barely a week goes by that I dont think about that guy So I just do it myself now - even when I dont have much to offer I can at least be polite and helpful (eg take the time to help people carry a pushchair down the train station stairs etc) Even if the person is still rude back or whatever I like to think that maybe 1 time in 100 Ill inspire them to pay it forward too,kryptopeg,16222943580,1

gxca5n0,n79n8y,I can think of two cases at the top of my head: I always keep a certain amount of money on me at all times in bills whenever Im out and about (the equivalent of 60 USD in my countrys currency) because I know that if nothing else if something happens then it will be enough for me to pay for buss fare or a train ticket to get me back home pay for a meal and/or get me a roof over my head if I have to spend the night somewhere It has come in handy quite a few times Another example is that I always make sure to keep a couple of jugs filled with water at home in case the water stops running Came in handy when the landlord (with no warning whatsoever) shut off the water for three days straight so some handymen could replace some old pipes or something like that,Red_Eight_Zero,16204366490,5

gxdgz31,n79n8y,When my wife and I was preparing to get married we need to book a banquet (including the hall and dinning) My father was with us and in the end we choose a place that is quite secluded which unlike other places in Hong Kong requiring us to pay for 90% of the banquet in advance (in monthly payments) My father questioned this a bit and jokingly said the what if they go bankrupt And the staff said they are a very well known club in Hong Kong (normally requires annual membership of HKD 1 million if not for a wedding banquet) and how would they go bankrupt And my father said as big as Lehman Brothers can go bankrupt so why not Fast forwards half a year that we already paid for more than half the payment in advance They indeed go bankrupt Well theres no way we can prepare for this And if according to common practice of bankruptcy we wouldnt be getting a dime back (as there are more "important" people ahead of the queue so to speak to get their money back) But since the founder of that club doesnt agree with that discussion and he personally arranged us to get back all the money from a law firm within a few days Thats a roller coaster ride and while we are very thankful we can get the money back (if not we would be broke and cant hold a wedding banquet) we still need to find another place It was then half a year prior to our wedding date and in Hong Kong people normally need to book for that in advance for at least a year Thankfully we can find one that still have opening partially because were Christian and so our wedding date is not a "fortunate date" (in Chinese culture people superstitiously assign dates to be good/bad for a certain activities including wedding So a "fortunate date" for wedding normally is fully booked like at least a year or even 2 in advanced) Everything went smooth for our wedding But a few years later when we visited Hong along and want to revisit that place they are closed already (I guess it is not a rarity for a restaurant to close business from time to time),kolench,16204691920,3
gxe58er,n79n8y,Im not rich by any means but when I was in college paying for it myself I had this irrational fear of someone having a heart attack and dying in front of me Many people in my family have died of them and I thought it was an inevitable matter of time till I witnessed it and couldnt help So I took out a credit card and maxed it out buying a portable AED and advanced medical kit to keep in my car Parents and family thought I was an idiot since I had no medical training (I did learn how to use the AED and take basic medicine classes through the Red Cross after getting it) I started to feel kind of psychotic and crazy for just dropping a ton of money I didnt have About 4 months later at a bar this older guy falls on the floor not responding Grabbed the kit and luckily an off duty emt was there and took over to stabilize him while the ambulance was on the way Took me a long time to pay off that expense but I still think its one of the most important things Ive ever done,dinosroarus,16204856390,3

gxcp6mn,n79n8y,TLDR: We had a condo with issues in the building my paranoid brain said things could get way worse so we sold for a massive loss only to learn that mere months later the whole building and suite flooded The long version: We owned a condo that had some issues with the mechanical heating system We all had fan coils in our units that werent doing well Theres a lot of details but long story short we decided to nope out of there because we were tired of dealing with the issues We knew there was a big special assessment coming down the pipes (they told us $30k for units our size) a flood from the year before had made our insurance premium (for the building) go up and made the deductible for water $300k and I didnt want to wait around while the board hemmed and hawed about what to do about the fan coils that werent functioning properly So we list at a low price to account for the problems and risk knowing well lose ~$100k and Im panicked the whole time because all I can think is omg we have to sell now because a fan coil will fail the building is going to flood the insurance deductible is so high that the cost is going to be a nightmare Simultaneously trying to calm myself down because the board wasnt concerned because they were working on a fix We sold really fast despite a slow market and all the building issues because the unit looked amazing and we made it a quick close The time between closing and possession was complete torture thinking of all the things that could go wrong - the assessment (which we disclosed was eventually coming to the seller) could get levied early and wed be on the hook the place could flood before the mech system got fixed etc One of the most stressful months of my life Of course at the same time to some extent worrying we were making a huge mistake by selling because we were losing so much money and the suite was AMAZING (god I miss that kitchen and natural light) We hand over the keys and move back into our tiny original condo 2 months later a pipe bursts on the top floor of the building and the whole thing floods on one side including our former suite Last we heard they were looking at special assessments of >$100k now to cover the floods plus all the original stuff that had to be done Needless to say the whole experience completely reinforced my paranoid "everything that can go wrong will" thinking Im just glad we went with our gut that things could always get worse  (Edited to add the TLDR),alexithymix,16204453380,2

I got a few yes and then worked my arse off bull rushing the completion of the GED and auto All while leaving him to think we had nowhere else to go Shortly after I acquired those the house started to regain its familiar tension It started out small little comments and complaints about stuff Then one day him and my partner got into a fight He yelled at her and I snapped Memory is foggy but it went about like this: Him: yells at her Me: yells back Him: "you dont yell at me in my house Me: "I dont give a fuck whos house we are in you dont yell at her Also Im the only one making money and paying the mortgage so whose house is this really?" Him: "Get the fuck out now" Me: "One step ahead of you chief" *pulls out my phone and calls friend A* "Hey yo it happened like I thought it would so can you come on over please?"

gxd2dtc,n79n8y,In this thread Im seeing people who are prepared for any situation but not people who are overthinking social situations I constantly second guess my conversations and things like writing an email or a text message take me significantly longer than it should If someone catches me off guard I freeze I cant speak until Ive been given enough time to think about my words Usually I think about all the worst case scenarios and end up figuring out exactly what not to say Like this time at work I got in trouble for ignoring my bosses requests for something I didnt want to do I knew I was well within my rights to not do x and I also knew my boss didnt care about my rights I spent the entire time she reprimanded me thinking of all the awful things I could say and when it came time to talk I said the one thing she didnt expect "Well if its really that bad that I didnt do x maybe the store manager should know about it" She smirked like you dumb fuck you just got yourself fired So she setup a meeting with the store manager later that day While I waited I thought of all the ways I could fuck this up Ultimately I went into that meeting and laid it down in the most eloquent way that I knew the employee handbook from front to back and that my boss was trying to bully me into doing x to look good Within a few weeks my boss was demoted to manage a much smaller department and I was basically in my own league Managers were afraid to ask anything more from me beside basic duties and as long as customers were happy To be clear X was not normal job duties that meant coworkers had to pick up slack X was asking customers to donate to some charity run by the store No where in the manual did it say I had to ask for donations and the next year the store policy became no asking for donations after the first week which I was fine with Asking for donations actually angered customers because they had been asked so many times I actually got just as many donations not asking as other part time employees one customer even donated $100 and said "I come to your line because you dont ask me for money everyday",0RGASMIK,16204550940,2
gxdcyqm,n79n8y,Oh dear I have plenty (Im very paranoid) the biggest ones that stick out are as follows A few years ago a bored me decided to order a set of lockpicks online and learned how to pick basic locks in my prime I could pick every lock in our house in under a few minutes each I carried these picks with me every day and have broken into: 5 of my friends houses when they forgot keys The place I worked at twice when the managers didnt bother showing up A bedroom in my new apartment that a previous tenant left deadbolted And my parents back door that they lost the key to The second and most recent validation of my ceaseless paranoia involved the power going out when my wife is was still pregnant Naturally the only solution to this was to kit every room with a battery powered touch light And install 3 battery operated remote controlled lights in the 3 most important rooms in the house; nursery living room and bedroom Along with this I purchased 3 flashlights a white gas camping stove (for cooking and heating bottles) and a battery powered led lantern Sure enough last week a tornado came through early in the morning Without hesitation I hit the remote I had command stripped to the wall right by the bed and we had light to collect the babies (we had twins) and move them to the bathroom Afterwards we didnt even need the flashlights due to the touch lights and lantern Fortunately we didnt need to use the stove but the $80 I spent on supplies was completely validated And even if its the only time we ever have to use them id spend that money again in a heartbeat In an uncontrollable situation like that just having light and a way to feed your children gives you all the peach of mind you need and I highly recommend getting your home set up in the same fashion,KYETHEDARK,16204652180,2

gxfll6x,n79n8y,In college I worked at a little Mom & Pop sandwich shop located next door to a bank in a strip mall in SoCal The bank semi-frequently got robbed and being the over-thinker that I am I would run through scenarios in my head of what I would do if someone ever tried to rob us We had a silent alarm but it required a specific code number: 9 which you had to manually input located in the office but not by the cash register The control panel for the alarm also had a code for the doorbell that rang every time someone entered or exited the shop One day this guy came in who I had seen a few times before Im at the register and he walks up pulls his shirt up to expose the handgun nestled in his waistband and said "please give me the money in there" nodding to the register My stomach dropped and Im lost for a second but then I calmly ask my co-worker behind me to enter code 9 to shut off the doorbell This at least triggers the silent alarm while I open the register and hand him the few 20s 10s and 5s in there I did not lift up the cash drawer itself so the rolls of change and a few hundreds and fifties and checks stayed safe in there He takes the money says "thank you Im sorry" and leaves The police show up a moment later we filed a report and whatnot but I dont think he was ever caught I actually felt a little bad for the guy He was so polite and I could tell this was a last resort for him Im so glad it was me at the register and not other members of my crew who may not have handled it well It couldve gone very badly for all of us I still think of him sometimes and wonder what he needed the money for and if hes ok And I still remember the sinking feeling of seeing that gun and what might have happened if I had handled the situation differently,Arrr_jai,16205117970,2

gz4scg1,n79n8y,Have you ever wanted to take a dump on your bosses desk? Well my mother did just that Heres the story So I worked for a local newspaper company as a mid-level manager I was basically in charge of being sure that all the actual newspaper carriers were doing their jobs right The company basically expected me to be sure all the carriers had working vehicles otherwise I would have to drive the routes myself I knew at the time that one carrier who had 3 routes totaling 250ish miles a day had just had her truck repoed and would not be able to do her job without help I asked around for a car to borrow with no luck As a last resort I talked my own mother into letting her borrow my now deceased dads truck with the guarantee that my mother would be reimbursed by the company for whatever miles that the truck was driven Originally the carrier borrowing the truck was only supposed to need it for a work day or two Well after two weeks she was still using the truck One day during that time my mother and I had a conversation where I said "I bet money that my boss/the company will back out of guaranteeing the mileage reimbursement money and we will end up with nothing" Her response was something to the effect of "theyll be hearing from me personally if they do" Sure enough 6 WEEKS into the carrier using the truck I get called into the office and am told that the company can no longer guarantee any money for the use of the truck Of course my mother was not happy BUT my boss told me that he would personally be standing there when that carrier got her next paycheck and would have his hand out to get a personal check for the amount due at the time of over $1600 Payday came and turns out he did not do what he said he would and it would now be up to me to get our money Now a little background on my mother She recently had a Colostomy Surgery to repair whatever Since then shes had to wear a colostomy bag and will continue to have to wear one until her next surgery to reattach everything So anyway after the 6 weeks my boss tells me to give the carrier an ultimatum: get her shit together and find a car or well be taking my mothers truck back and she loses her job My mother and I have several more conversations about what she would do if she doesnt get the money thats due I also decided that if the carrier gets fired then I would quit too because I wasnt willing to do three more routes on top of my original job Ultimatum Time comes and goes (8 weeks total of the carrier having the truck later) the mileage bill ends up being OVER $2100 We go and pick up the truck and I had put in my two weeks notice The last day I was working my mother walks in the front door to the office as if she was a customer I immediately knew shit was fixing to hit the fan She walks right into my bosses office closes the door and proceeds to have an hour long chat about the lack of respect that my boss had treated me and by extension my mother with After a while I get called into the office with the two of them and the boss tells us again why the company could not give us the money that was due After which my mother ended the conversation with one last grand statement She stood up said "Well When you treat people like shit" She lifted up the side of her shirt unscrewed the cap to the colostomy bag and dumped the contents directly onto the bosses desk splattering everywhere including on him his keyboard computer monitor all the papers on his desk and running over the edge between his legs My mother then very calmly screwed the cap back on the bag tucked it back under her shirt and walked out the door Both the boss and I were stunned speechless After 10-15 seconds of awed silence the smell hits us and its BAD The boss looks at me and says "Clean this up" to which I reply "Nope what goes around comes around" and I left the building laughing hysterically as all the other employees looked on in horror as the boss walked out of his office with a perfect line of splattered shit across his mid-chest,Crakidos,16217471710,2

gxclv3e,n79n8y,Ive learned that Im not an overthinker and the label is often used problematically incorrect Other people just dont have my capacity to consider realistically addressable problems and explore a solution approach towards a substantially better outcome Or others dont care to be prepared for reasonable things that could happen becausethey just ride on luck or privilege Or maybe theyre just OK accepting bad outcomes they could have reasonably (and comfortably) prevented Other (popular) comments here show me people conflate overthinking with preparedness Its not over thinking to consider how you should handle a situation that could arise and where you wouldnt be able to think clearly when/if it hits: how to exit a room or building if a fire occurred or if an active shooter is around Overthinking to me only has a few forms that are actual negatives: stirring over a problem you wont be able to solve or control or you can clearly address and think through what to do when/if it occurs For example: what if the wings fall off this plane at 30000ft? Yeah you wont be able to do shit to increase your survival in the few minutes it takes to fall "What if the kids dont like the food?" is (usually) not an emergency Buy a pepperoni pizza then "What if my date doesnt like my shirt?" - yup back to nothing to do there Its probably your jokes anyways and you dont have time to learn new ones Otherwise maybe if an overthinker reacts by spending way too much of a resource and creating another problem Could be time like preventing a group from starting a trip because refusal to push forward on reasonable plans; or maybe spending extra money on what-ifs while not having enough for certain and immediate needs Vehicle safety public and commercial travel safety has saved countless lives through "overthinking" Capitalism is what stopped overthinkers from being able to solve the 737MAX sensor problem: "what if this sensor isnt working? What will the plane do? How will the pilots know this is the problem and can they address it?" Turns out twice the answer was "they cant",ebonyseraphim,16204433080,1

gxctd36,n79n8y,A global pandemic (as much as you can be prepared such a thing anyway) Back when SARS was a thing my mother a nurse impressed upon me how a pandemic could mean a two week lockdown and that stuck with me Queue 2019 I took 4 months of leave from my work because I had this ominous feeling it would be the last normal summer for a while if not ever and I wanted to spend it traveling and getting to know my then girlfriend I had a blast almost died rock climbing in Morocco danced with beautiful women (no cheating) in Turkey (twice actually) and spent my free time lounging around with my girl and rock climbing During November and December of that year I started brainstorming this novel that would be set in the future and would end with a worldwide pandemic I was also saving up money for a sailboat which had been a dream of mine for most of my life A month before the pandemic hit my country I broke up with my girlfriend and bought a used boat When the pandemic hit I stopped working on the novel and moved into my boat full time It felt surreal and still does actually Looking back I made all the right moves I could at the time and 2020 went all right for me,000111001101,16204480750,1
gxcth78,n79n8y,I traveled to Venice with my cousins in 2018 The last day of our trip we had a disagreement on how to spend the morning: our flight back home would depart at 7 pm I guessed we should arrive at the airport three hours prior given it was a new unfamiliar airport and the later you arrive the longer the queues you might encounter increasing the chance to miss your flight Besides we had to commute to get there: we had to take a bus that would take an hour on the road and a ferry from the place we rented to the bus station that would take about 40 min to get there so all things considered I though we should head out at noon but my cousins said I was exaggerating and we would have plenty of room if we spent the morning shopping and headed out at 3:30 And yes sure if everything goes right but judging by the amount of commutes in unfamiliar territory at carnival season I doubted that was likely Now if we miss the flight we would end up paying circa $2000 per person for a new ticket back home and for accommodation which meant *I* would end up paying $6000 for all of us since cousin 1 could barely afford to come and cousin 2 had her wallet stolen at day 2 which on itself would be lost money because I could not foresee an scenario where they would pay me back with a smile if at all So I lied and said we actually had to leave at noon since the Airbnb was rented already for that afternoon and since shopping carrying around luggage in carnival season was exhausting they dropped the idea and we headed straight to the airport And just like I foresaw things went wrong: we bought ferry tickets for the bus station but waited in the wrong spot waited circa half an hour just for the ferry to deny us boarding saying they were a different company by the time we arrived to the actual spot the ferry had already left and we had to wait for the next one This delay caused for us to miss the bus and had to wait for the next one We barely made it to the airport just a minute before they closed baggage check,nellfallcard,16204481540,1

gwkn10y,n2l1f9,The world is like a ride in an amusement park and when you choose to go on it you think its real because thats how powerful our minds are The ride goes up and down around and around it has thrills and chills and its very brightly colored and its very loud and its fun for a while Many people have been on the ride a long time and they begin to wonder "Hey is this real or is this just a ride?" And other people have remembered and they come back to us and say "Hey dont worry; dont be afraid ever because this is just a ride" And we kill those people "Shut him up! Ive got a lot invested in this ride shut him up! Look at my furrows of worry look at my big bank account and my family This has to be real" Its just a ride But we always kill the good guys who try and tell us that you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok But it doesnt matter because its just a ride And we can change it any time we want Its only a choice No effort no work no job no savings of money Just a simple choice right now between fear and love The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors buy guns close yourself off The eyes of love instead see all of us as one Heres what we can do to change the world right now to a better ride Take all that money we spend on weapons and defenses each year and instead spend it feeding and clothing and educating the poor of the world which it would pay for many times over not one human being excluded and we could explore space together both inner and outer forever in peace Bill Hicks Got into Bill Hicks when I was in my early twenties and the quote especially as passionate he is about it when saying it in his recorded shows really stuck with me,pointlessquid,16198955390,1

gv7wc82,mur1p5,The Star Wars Sequels Disney orchestrated them to effectively replace the original trilogy They made them a reboot in this weird attempt to appeal to people who didnt like SW to begin with as well as new international audiences Despite the fact that SW was already one of the biggest movie series in the world and in fact didnt need money from a lot of these new foreign markets or demographics to be successful And note Im not saying this as I am mad at either of these two groups but mad at Lucasfilm for thinking this should be the goal of sequels to some of the most beloved movies of all time It would be like making Godfather 3 but its just a shot for shot remake of Godfather 1 The story of the sequel films also focuses on not just retelling the OT story basically but also destroying all of the OT characters along the way Han is a deadbeat dad who abandoned his family Luke is a homicidal coward who turned his back on the galaxy and let evil flourish in his abscense Everything the heroes fought for in the OT is destroyed in the first film The second film destroys Luke Skywalker as a character and then the third film destroys Vaders arc and purpose as the chosen one These movies were systematically created to destroy the SW that came before it And you can turn off your brain and act like this wasnt intentional but it definitely was I mean why the fuck make a theme park based on SW and you base it on the sequels not the 40 year old films that have stood the test of time but these movies that just came out a few years ago Disney theme parks are all about celebrating older films Why use the sequel to theme the SW theme park unless you are stating "this is the *ONLY* SW from now on" That was their mission and it failed totally The Joker made more money than Rise of Skywalker Sequel film toys rot in the toy isles You have failed your highness we will not buy into your shit,BizzarroJoJo,16189365770,38

h26pbhj,o2hlbv,Try to be Jeffs friend Jeff was a really big deal in middle school We went to different elementary schools so I never even heard of him prior to middle school but as soon as I got to middle school his name was going around the school a lot and it became clear he was a big deal Jeff was the toughest guy in our grade the most athletic the best looking and the coolest according to both the guys and the girls The guys wanted to be his friend and if they werent then they were wary of him because of how tough he was and he gave off that vibe that he wasnt someone to make angry All the girls loved him and he was making out with girls and going out with them all the time He even went out with at least two girls a year ahead of us in school and one of them was the most popular girl in her grade This was basically unheard of but he did it He was in my class in the 6th grade and it became pretty clear that despite his coolness toughness and ability with the girls at a young age Jeff had some problems and couldnt control himself that well He would act out in funny ways by causing mischief and trouble but he would also act out in less funny-yet-troubling ways by doing things like smoking cigarettes on school grounds with other troubled kids and he would occasionally get physical with any guy dumb enough to piss him off Because of this he got detentions and suspensions That year our class had a field trip to some place that I dont remember but I do remember the bus ride to and from the trip Jeff and I were on the same bus and for some reason still unknown to me he decided to sit next to me On the way there he was talking to me about different things and since I thought he was a bully and tough and I was afraid of him I just was nice and would listen and then follow up with questions and try to interact with him and he seemed to be cool with that Then at some point he started talking about his home life and his dad and he said that his dad would hit him upside the head When he told me this he had his eyes averted and sort of looking down and he said it kind of like it was a joke but I could tell that he was upset by it and was trying to play it off cool and by acting like it wasnt some big deal On the bus ride back to school we stopped at some place and there were these vending machines that some kids were getting snacks out of I went to get myself a snack and a drink and I got my drink but something happened when I tried to get my snack I cant remember what it was exactly It may have been that I thought I had more money than I did and when I went to get my snack I came up short for money or it could have been that the machine ate my money Whatever happened I couldnt get my snack and I was upset because I was pretty hungry Without asking him or saying anything Jeff just stepped in front of me and said "I got you" and put a dollar in the machine for me so I could get my snack Then we sat next to each other on the way back to school after that At some point during that year we had a substitute teacher for our class and some kids were acting out and I was laughing because it was funny Our substitute was a middle-aged woman and she was not happy at all She was yelling at us to shut up and knock it off and she physically grabbed me by the shoulders and then started pushing me downward into my chair and desk and I was frightened by it I was scared and didnt know what to do and she was hurting me When class ended Jeff grabbed me by the arm and said "Come on were going to the office" and he basically pushed me and pulled me down the hallway to the principals office I wasnt going to say no to the guy in a million years because I was afraid of him We get to the office and he does all the talking and tells the principal what happened while I just sit there in silence nodding each time that the principal asks me if what Jeff is saying is true See the principal had and would go on to have numerous run-ins and issues with Jeff because Jeff could not behave and kept getting into trouble way too often The principal was wary of him and didnt trust him much and I suppose he had good reason not to However I still remember the concerned look on his face when Jeff was telling him what happened When Jeff was done talking we left the office and the principal said hell look into the incident and thats all I remember I figured that Jeff was just using me to act out and cause trouble or give the principal a headache in having to deal with him yet again I was too afraid of Jeff to say to him that I didnt want to go to the office so what happened happened and that was that Jeff was expelled from school early in the 8th grade Word spread around the school quickly because the kid was such a big deal I dont remember why he got kicked out exactly or what the final straw was He basically disappeared in 2003 and I never saw him againor so I thought He was off my radar for years and I had heard that he got kicked out of his second school after he got kicked out of ours and then in high school he got kicked out of a catholic school and then wound up at a pretty crappy public school I didnt know at the time whether he even finished high school or not In the fall of 2007 I was a senior in high school and I was hanging around at a friends house after a party ended on the weekend Seemingly out of nowhere Jeff shows up with a guy I used to be friends with in earlier years I hadnt seen Jeff since 2003 He was still big looked about 6 foot 3 and still had that kind of socially and physically dominant way about him He was joking around with the guy he came with and he playfully pushed him on the shoulder after making a joke and the guy almost lost his balance and fell over Jeff just couldnt help it Being the alpha male and dominant is how he always was I was sitting on the couch with my friend and the guy who hosted the party and then the guy who almost got pushed over smiled at Jeff a bit and said "You remember [insert my name here]?" and Jeff stared at me for a few seconds I definitely didnt look exactly like I did in middle school but he stepped closer to me and looked me in the eyes and put his hand out to shake my hand but didnt say anything to me Then he went back to drinking the beer he had and joking around Thats the last time I saw him before he died Jeff died a few years ago I think from a drug overdose heroin probably He was 27 I determined that at some point his father who was abusive and likely violent with him when he was a kid left the family likely when Jeff was about 15 or 16 It looked like Jeff and his mom and little sister had to leave our town and they wound up in a crummier more rundown area He fell into the druggie crowd in later years after he was kicked out of middle school and I suppose this shouldnt have been surprising because his older brother overdosed on heroin and died when me and Jeff were in the 7th grade I remember that going around the school at the time and people talking about it in whispers It took me until I was 30 years-old to put my brief-yet-meaningful moments with Jeff together I went my whole life thinking that he was the school bully and I was afraid of him yet I realized eventually that I never saw him bully anyone and that he never bullied me I remembered our time on the bus together and our trip to the office but I couldnt connect the dots at the time Now I realize that on the bus Jeff was grateful that I listened to him talk about his dad hitting him and because I was nice and good to him when I needed help at the vending machines he had my back no questions asked When our substitute teacher did what she did to me I later realized that this happened after the bus trip and vending machines day Because I was nice and good to him when he saw what the teacher did to me he didnt decide to use me as a way to act out and start trouble - he was just trying to help me because he apparently cared and was concerned When I saw him after that party was over in high school he truly did remember me and he remembered those moments we had together where we had each others backs in the 6th grade He could have just said "Whats up" when the other guy asked him if he remembered me but instead of that he moved towards me and shook my hand because even after years of having nothing to do with each other those 6th grade memories came back to him that night but not to me at the time At 30 I put it all together Im truly sad that hes gone and when we were kids I would have never thought that I would say that about him feel that way about him or that he would die young The guy was the biggest deal and the last person I would have thought wouldnt make it in life but sadly his demons and troubles took him away Once I understood Jeff I began thinking of him as a legend of my childhood Recently I realized that calling Jeff a legend -- while accurate and true -- doesnt truly explain and express what he means to me In a life filled with much hurt and pain doled out to me by the people whom I used to call friends and family as well as abuse dished out by others out there Jeff is one of the only people whose friendship goodness and memory is not tainted by time and by how people eventually began to treat me over time All that he ever was was good to me respectful kind decent caring supportive fearless empathetic friendly and true He was never anything bad to me for as long as I knew him and hes the best friend that I never had Thats why calling him a legend doesnt quite express what he is to me all these years later Hes not a legend; hes my hero,thesadredditor,16240015950,721

h26pqd0,o2hlbv,I would punch my teacher I had this jackass of a teacher who when ever I went up a grade so did he So I had him for 3 years I would have been 15 the last year I had him He actively tried to publicly humiliate me my parent constantly had to intervene I got to the point where I pulled in on myself He would put me in groups for group work I would ask if I can just do it on my own because he is going to pull me from the group at the last minute and I would have to scramble to finish the project alone And he would sat no I would work hard he would pull me out because I was out sick a day or I was not contributing enough or I was monopolizing the group or I wore a blue shirt that day I kid you not once I said yes to everything the group wanted I agreed took on extra work and he pulled me out because I was being to agreeable He had a standing rule that if one a self evaluation I gave myself over a 50% I had to stand in front of that class to justify why my work was worth more then 50% Then he would call me stupid because I wasnt doing well in his classes So yeah I would punch him I would literally keep hitting him til someone pulled me off And my parents would have defended me Because that jack ass was proud he bullied an awkward 15 year old girl to the point she would cry if he said group protect Then I would save more money Might side step a relationship Go to grad with my best friend instead of the guy who pretended to be sick to get me to leave then tried for sex while I drove him home Oh and he threw up on me the next day I would get on antidepressants sooner Change what I did for schooling And move to live with my bf who is now my husband sooner,dogs_playing_poker,16240019610,2
h27ddxb,o2hlbv,I would: - tell myself to dont go to school the last day (when I was heavily bullied and it caused me a trauma for several years) - tell my best friend to dont go on vacation (where he had an accident and died) - tell my mother to go to a psychologist when her husband left her instead of asking to the 18y/o me to take care of her while she was like a zombie - tell my granma to dont stop to take medicines fornher depression because that will cause her worst depression episode of her life - enjoy foreing travels more: my mothers husband used to work in a foreing country (really homophobic) and we used to travel there 2-3 times a year and stay there for one month I never really enjoyed the travels because I always was in a relationship with someone so I was always sad for the distance and always trying to find a way to be online to chat with them Now I would tell myself to care less about them and enjoy every single minute becuase now I really regret it because it was such a beautiful place and I will not be able to go back there cause of money and becuase Im gay - keeping every single coin instead of spending for really stupid things Im already a big saver but since both my and my boyfriends family are not part of our life we are doing everything alone and we are not able to buy a house Saving money since when I was 15 would have help us not only to buy a house but to choose to buy it where we dream to buy it I thought about this yesterday and one of the things I was thinking about was this: - I would search for the guy who now is my boyfriend and tell him to finish school and try to do anything to find is dream job while he still was with his parents (He regrets that he didnt finish to go to school and even if he finished it one year ago now that we live alone with any kind of help and a 8+ years in the same company (completely different from the kind of job he wants to do) it is really difficult to change job This last thing makes me really nervous because I always think: if I change this thing maybe we will never meet But at the same time to change this thing I would need to be part of his life so maybe we could have been together like 10 years before when I met him,oneinamelon91,16240208560,2

h27pkuc,o2hlbv,Well its not as good as going back to age 11 or 12 but it will have to do A lot would hinge on being able to convince my parents that this traveling-back jas occurred In 1999 theres the clinton impeachment trial the columbine massacre and family guy airing for the first time after the super bowl so i would predict those i guess and use them as leverage to try to convince them The big priorities then would be going over some stuff adult me knew then but much more deeply understands the impact and trauma of _now_: At the time (ive since been diagnosed but not until my 30s) i had adhd combined type and was literally powering through my schoolwork entirely on my ability to ignore my own emotional trauma and cram for stuff in the hour before tests extremely fast because i typically forgot my assignments in between; i would put forward that i need formal assessment as well as appropriate medication to have the resources I need to excel I am probably also autistic (adhd and autism are often comorbid) and in either case have some sensory issues particularly sound-related that need to be addressed for me to be able to thrive I would also have recommendations for other family members My older brother B also had undiagnosed adhd and depression S too to an extent (pretty much all of us had some degree of depression really) Dad also has really bad adhd which between that and his own unprocessed insecurity and anger issues explains a lot Mom has depression In general all of us are traumatized and neuroatypical in various ways and different things turn out to work for all of us Also quitting smoking for brother b and sister r happen but take time Also i start nicotine lozenges as a low dose nootropic for adhd along w my adhd meds in this timeline because it is helping me a lot now I am transgender It would be too late for some effects of puberty and hormones but much better than where I am now This would be a much harder conversation and would need to take several reminders to hit home to get them to see me as their daughter and not as someone that had just had some kind of episode and was laying all those stuff on them I would have to put a lot of effort just to convince them that it wasnt a fetish or a mental disorder and in fact makes sense given our general family history as well as the history of the world and the nature of biology Oh also my uncle sam has autism and is kind of low functioning as well as problems with hoarding And is like me a closeted trans woman Also my sister Rs second child V (if borm the same in this timeline which maybe not) is going to have special needs related to autism because they are of the nonspeaking category and need to get enrolled in an assistive program And is probably ALSO trans although that is not definite And T who was already born / Vs older brother? Depression So these are all issues we are better off confronting and treating rather than avoiding starting with: i need to get on hormone blockers and adhd meds B needs adhd meds antidepressants and therapy Dad needs adhd meds and therapy These three people are key because we affect quality of life the most for the family but every one of us has things that they need But everyone needs some degree of intervention ultimately Everyone in the family pretty much needs therapy eventually for different reasons Mom and dad seriously need a better way to deal with dads severe adhd and inability to get housechores done or succeed in life generally without guilt tripping or verbally abusing him anymore Dad needs to acknowledge that things being unhygienic and disorganized is hard for him and everyone else I would also have to convince them that B is actually violently abusive and threatens my safety and that the antidepressants helped him a lot in being less violent last time around Also that he should not hang out with cousin M who nearly blinds him with a bb gun in his right eye in a backyard accident and has bad impulse control issues and empathy deficits and is a general bad influence Hard conversations to have all around Oh also some general strategies Uncle ss house is falling apart and is possibly unfixable and they will dwindle their inheritance away on nonsense and fill the house entirely after grandpas death due to depression anxiety and aforementioned hoarding (sorry lots to keep track of my upbringing was chaotic) The best thing is while grandpa B is alive to get him looked at for brain stuff since an aneurysm is what kills him And to figure out a better plan for sams house than what happened last time Preferably to move stuff to storage fix up and sell the place before the foundations and the chimney get worse Get on top of the hoarding issues before the rats take over entirely And then buy s and grandpa b another house Cousin M may be falling in with gangs and getting addicted to meth around then Aunt M may need therapy but probably wont get it They are kinda all toxic af the cousins really The good news is all the kids are super smart and capable I would go back knowing brother S did well in tech support brother B did well in construction but his real talent probably lies in computer engineering auto mechanics or biology - but first adhd depression and i am gonna guess with the violence and the rages he might like me be in that maybe-autistic range too And that i was successful but deeply unhappy in software engineering And that i should focus on doing what i am passionate about while there is time to launch something and not listen to moms pessimistic naysaying about it being impossible to succeed if you do what you love I would also of course have us win a lottery if I could prepare before going back at all I would give them my limited financial advice which is to put a lot of the money into cash deposits but also some into specific investments like google and amazon And later bitcoin Since i already have part of a computer engineering degree and six years of software industry experience i would also have all that knowledge so that would be a serious leg up on the education game I guess i would focus on actually completing my computer engineering degree this time I would focus on the running start program again in high school but be set up with adhd meds and know which people to befriend and who to avoid this time (some of them turned out to be awful but mostly i would be seeking out my old friends One sexually assaults someone if i recall for instance I would have a talk with the victim in private in advance and try to prevent this as best i could) I would tell J about how miserable ish life in japan turns out but also the good stuff (his daughter Miyumi mainly) I would have another recommendation for my family: hire housekeepers now that we are rich Too many people who cant quite look after themselves reliably Same for (aunt) s wherever they end up I would start on hrt as soon as i could By the time i got into uni i would be a lot more comfortable mentally and healthier physically I would focus on completing my computer engineering degree I would be able to afford to get it this time I would not live in campus housing but i would move to dt portland i would help out natali with the homelessness situation again and give her the same advice albeit with some caveats (this guy you meet who houses you and puts you through school has anger issues and will turn a bit abusive You decide you love him anyways in my timeline and he gets into therapy and stuff improves a bit for you both But nerds in general in hindsight are no less prone to toxicity) I would also seek out my uni friend cam since we would not be in the same year anymore I would admit that what i was going to say would sound a bit nuts but that i had to thank her for inspiring me with her courage in being able to come out and be myself the last time around I would also warn her about covid and the coastal fires and upcoming political disasters re trump and give some stock tips as part of that thank you I think with enough lotto winnings i could focus on art and fixing the planet I guess i would get into drones and cybersecurity for uh reasons And maybe be some kind of tech media figure who was kinda solarpunk / transhumanist / socialist themed Probably try to start like freegeek but for vehicles with a focus on lithium ion battery recycling to keel them out of the waste stream And take muay thai again And get into rollerblades and date more Generally the changes would be amazing although i would sometimes get a little sad about people i never met this time but i would also be happy about people i did meet i hadnt run inti last time I couldnt solve every world problem nor would i want to,keirapersephoneblack,16240268290,1

gvfngcc,mvicaw,Not a doctor or nurse but my coworker and her family all caught covid but were denier They believed it was all a hoax and that even in the unlikely event that there was something going around it was just being played up and blown out for corporate gains/the libs and pharmacy companies were just trying to get money and control but god would protect them in the end so they still attended church and when the church had to shut down due to state mandates they all went to their preachers house and worshiped there Both her parents her 6 siblings that lived with them her other 8 siblings that had visited for Thanksgiving their spouses 5 of her nieces and nephews and herself all got covid because someone who was positive attended a church service with them and most of the congregation caught covid as well Her family didnt believe it was a thing and when 2 of the nephews werent feeling well no one thought anything of it She went to work kept having to be reminded to keep her mask on even when the store was closed she spent the majority of the day with myself and the store manager on a project in very close quarters then her mom and a few siblings had to be rushed from work to the ER due to them not being able to breathe We all found out a few days later that she and everyone I had listed from her family had gotten tested and tested positive and she had come to work anyway because she felt fine and believed that it was all a hoax When she eventually came back to work about a month later she was still suffering from long term effects and explained that at first they had all fought being quarantined and thought they werent allowed to visit the hospitalized family members due to the hospital putting on a show to keep up the covid lie Then her dad and in total 14 other family members had to be put in the ICU and have tubes put in because they were so bad The ones who werent in the hospital either had no symptoms at all to mild symptoms; she ended up having mild symptoms Her dad apparently kept fighting and screaming that he didnt have covid and it was just some mutated flu so the hospitals could get money the government could instate martial law and that he was a child of god who was protected then he ended up going brain dead due to lack of oxygen and eventually the family decided to pull him off of life support But when it was all said and done my coworker lost 8 family members was asked to resign for knowingly coming to work with covid and not telling anyone and has had difficulty finding work because the health effects afterwards have her needing to sit down every 20 or so steps As for my boss and I my boss tested positive the same day as her daughter who got it from work so it went through their family and she lost her brother who was housing her daughter and granddaughter right before the positive test and I and my husband ended up testing negative but ironically/extremely luckily ended up with just a regular flu a few days after I was exposed,2baverage,16190927470,35
gvds9le,mvicaw,Sort of related but I felt the need to chime in Im a new ICU nurse that started working roughly 8 months ago We had a young patient (<35 years old) that wasnt admitted for COVID but we were all pretty certain that they had it previously and their lungs were significantly damaged resulting in their admission This patient was on high flow nasal cannula for a while but progressed to 100% BiPaP (a mask you wear which forces air into your lungs basically the closest thing you can get to a ventilator without having a breathing tube) This patient would routinely desaturate to less then 30% with their mask off I am not exaggerating here Normal pulse ox sats are 92-100% Incredibly sick patients in respiratory distress coming into the ED can be in the 50-60% range Again LESS than 30% perfect waveform and everything Unbelievable Regardless the conversation of intubation (breathing tube) was brought up multiple times to the patient and family The family refused every time claiming that putting the patient on the ventilator was just the hospital trying to make money off of them During one of the final conversations with the family it got so heated that our hospital security had to come and escort the family out after the team pleaded for them to try the ventilator as it was basically the only chance they had in saving the patient Family didnt budge A day later the patient coded (heart stopped) and the patient had to be emergently intubated They were able to bring him back but less then 24 hours later they coded again and passed away I didnt directly work with this patient but it was incredibly frustrating to hear about Us nurses often joke about the "big nursing bucks" that we make Granted I feel fairly compensated most of the time but no one in their right mind in the hospital is in it solely for the financial incentive I have met some absolutely brilliant people working in the ICU who likely could have made 10x their salary working in another field People dedicate their lives working to hopefully be able to save someone elses The idea that healthcare workers are out here to make money related to the horrific situations of others is absolutely ludicrous,tozli,16190467900,30

gveoohi,mvicaw,Covid nurse for most of 2020 Had some that came to the ED for shortness of breath cough etc and tested positive They admitted them and then they would sign themselves out AMA (against medical advice) either before coming to the floor or right after arriving because it was a fake virus the hospital just wanted to make more money by testing everyone etc At the very beginning they actually called the hospitals legal department to see if the patient was allowed to sign out AMA since this was a public health crisis Normally patients that are oriented can sign themselves out even if they are actively having a heart attack etc However the concern was letting someone leave who knowingly has a communicable disease who is not going to isolate wear a mask etc and expose the public to it They said it would be illegal to hold him and we had to let them go With all the mistakes that were made (and many of them made multiple times such as re-opening things and relaxing mask use) I have full confidence that with the next pandemic the officials and a percentage of the public will do everything wrong again Edit: I will add that far more patients had what I termed "Covid regret" That is they admitted they didnt believe the news the doctors etc and were careless and now regretted it One caught it at a party their family had Their elderly sister exposed them all and recovered; my patient died three days later It was a sad realization for many who lived or died and a most unfortunate way to learn,toejamandtoast,16190637930,14

gvetzdc,mvicaw,I work in hospital administration Ive heard countless stories about these Covid-denying idiots One that I personally was confronted with was some ahole screaming it was a hoax and barging out He was a man in his 60s who came out railing after he saw the doctor who must have told him he likely had Covid (dude refused a test) but where there saying he felt like he had glass in his throat and saying "*You sons of bitches are trying to admit me now with your fake China virus just to get money! Its all a hoax! The whole thing is a hoax! Fuck every one of you!*" He then started spitting at everybody he walked by He was in the lobby at this point and hes going up to patients spitting at them He spit at me (even though I was behind glass) Security detained him and police were called What was most infuriating was he was just allowed to leave Its like nobody wanted to get close to bother with him Even the doctor just waved him off to the police like "Just get him out of here" One woman whom he spat on was yelling at the cops that she wanted to press charges and they just dismissed her and let the lunatic go I too was fuming that after watching him assault (spit at) all these people he was able to just get in his car and drive off Namely because you knew he presented a danger This guy wasnt going home to isolate Hell be spreading it all over But the cops and medical staff just seemed exhausted and relieved he was out of the building and somebody elses problem It was very disappointing I asked a nurse standing by me why they werent pressing charges and she just sighed like "Whats the point?" This was in June last year when cases and hospitalizations were high here on the West Coast and we were all overworked and burnt out I can sympathize why the doctors and nurses were relieved to just have him out of their hair but it pissed me off they were so willing to let him escape consequence and Im still flabbergasted why the cops would just let him walk even when a woman he assaulted was requesting to press charges,Shane_Diggity,16190673200,8
gvdqsnj,mvicaw,Fun fact: Even in countries with free healthcare people will still believe youre trying to steal their money" They literally dont have to pay a dime to be diagnosed there are free Covid tests once a week vaccine is free and you pay 5 (5$) for prescribed medication max (theyd normally cost over hundreds of dollars) Still people believe Covid is a hoax and the vaccine is here to steal money and change your DNA or some shit,ShyArtsyFriend,16190460710,8
gvex7lm,mvicaw,I personally dont work in a hospital but I can speak for a family member of mine who works as a technician at our local hospital This person outright refuses to wear a mask and believes that COVID is just a big government boogie man They also believe wearing masks is the government slowly eroding our rights and that this is a testing ground for them to abolish the 2nd ammendment take all our money and then establish an autocracy with all the money they collected So yeah theyre a bit wack Anyway since this person works in a hospital they are required to wear masks at all times Yet they have personally bragged to me about not covering their nose purposefully like its some badge of honor to walk the halls of a hospital exhaling germs around healthcare professionals working their asses off to save lives and around patients who could potentially contract the disease if they come in contact Luckily this family member doesnt work in patient rooms so thats good I guess This person also was telling me that the hospital prepared for a massive surge back in June that never happend and was all like "Told you this shit aint real Government is trying to make you scared" Yet 2 months later when the ICU filled up cause the surge came late the excuse then became "I dont see any bodies so it cant be bad" Shits absolutely fucked I fear for this countrys future,GeneralAero,16190697700,7
gvet2d0,mvicaw,Im an ER doc Ive seen hundreds of cases and I live in trump country Most of them came around once the official diagnosis was made Certain patients would come in and you know its covid just by looking at them Usually theyre profoundly hypoxic (oxygen saturations 30-50%) and they didnt look like theyre working hard to breath I would explain that I think its covid and be met with some BS about how I want to make more money its a hoax or whatever politicized BS I spent a lot of time telling them to shut up about politics and listening to the news for health information Chastising them for using Facebook or 24/7 news as legitimate source versus listening to a physician with a decade of experience actually seemed to work for many of my patients Im a blunt person and just said "dude I dont care what you think Based on my experience youve got covid If you want to trust trump with your health than go ask him When youre ready to trust an actual expert Ill be here" When the diagnosis was official most accepted it if they didnt before One of the most annoying things was a family called to have me change the death certificate of their loved one Sorry not sorry he died in a covid unit thus covid played some sort of role Right now I love guilting people into trying to get the vaccine Now we have a new president some of the covid conspiracies have died down and I spend an extra 5 minutes discussing the science behind the vaccines and importance of getting them Things are much less heated and its easier to explain why its important for their health without it being made into a political argument Whats is the most frustrating to me isnt the covid deniers that are sick Its those that are relatively ok that dont think its a big deal Just dumbasses that send their child with a fever to school after they have a known contact thats positive for covid They should be quarantining regardless but especially with a fever Its straight up reckless endangerment of other people I saw soooo many people like this They look at me like Im stupid when I tell them they absolutely cannot go out I know quarantining at home is difficult on many of my patients but its the lack of regard for those they could hurt that pisses me off,cerasmiles,16190666530,7

They said that they were worried of being diagnosed with COVID if it wasnt and then receiving the wrong care I said if you were intentionally misdiagnosed and given the wrong medical care you could sue the hospital I mean come on! Most nurses and doctors are everyday people They arent in on some conspiracy If anyone is reporting higher coronavirus cases than what was actually there to get more money its not the doctors and nurses it would be the people that own the hospital The doctors and nurses are only trying to keep you healthy and alive! My mom ended up in the hospital for a couple of days and came home on oxygen Which is honestly very lucky because she overall is not healthy They also say that Covid wasnt cause of death because they had something else in addition to Covid And Im like okay well if someone has damaged lungs and gets Covid and dies the Covid is still what helped kill them!,lnmcg223,16190404530,5

ITS JUST A SCAM FOR YOU ALL TO MAKE EXTRA MONEY" After politely explaining to him that we would be keeping him for a while and reassuring him that I was actually not getting paid to give him this diagnosis he remained belligerent and demanded antibiotics and to be let go Unfortunately he ended up on a vent and ultimately succumbed to the hoax like a week later,DrDarkroom,16190351740,4

gw7c28e,n0jxcp,Some chick wouldnt stop pestering me at the bar one time so I made up a whole fake backstory about being a washed up Disney Channel star until she eventually got bored and left me alone I made up a theme song and everything and basically wouldnt let her change the subject Id probably just do that again __Big BIG Edit: let me tell you about the Y2K Disney shitshow that was *Bugchasers* (dont look it up)__ So exactly how much *do* you know about the show Bugchasers? Nothing? Boy do I envy you right now! The premise was basically four best friends discover that the Evil Dr Merkin is planning to release his Y2K bug into cyberspace (aka the Cyber Zone) Picture a Great Value boy band style of archetypes: A bad boy a jock the prankster (me) and the brainy one The brainy one Takeshi builds a portal to the Cyber Zone so we could battle the computer bugs in a very poor CGI world (basically Reboot/VR Troopers/Code Lyoko) We each had a specialty and a color scheme where I was cast as the green Bugchaser Louis "Snot" Bukowski who was equipped with a slime cannon and other gross bug traps stink bombs etc There were a ton of ongoing gags particularly between myself Takeshi and our big sister Melissa If youve been keeping up with the names so far you may have noticed that Takeshi who was the *yellow* Bugchaser has a significantly more Asian sounding name than "Louis" or "Melissa" Bukowski This is never explained this is never even addressed even with 13 episodes shot and 26 planned it wasnt even touched upon Anyways our big sister would usually tease him for being a dork or get mad at me for being gross and shed always get her cumuppence for being an outright bitch Shed get zapped fucking with electronics have sink bombs go off on her and even got sucked through the portal into the infamously disgusting "cyber slug zone" You know how each Walking Dead episode had that one scene that was just gratuitously disgusting for no other reason than to try and one up the previous episode? That became a thing with Melissa but it took a far more skeevy route Firstly lets cut to the *chase* (get it?) Youre probably more wondering what happened to this show and my career The show was straight up cursed It was supposed to go along with an arcade shooter and Sega Dreamcast game with basically no other merchandising The death of arcades and the Dreamcast flopping nixed that The blue Bugchaser Johnny (the jock wielding a long ranged bug zapper) was paralyzed while his mother was driving drunk and wheelchair bound right before the fourth episode was shot They told him they were just gonna "roll with it" but ended up replacing him I wont forget the heartbreak on his face when he showed up to the set only to find out he had lost more than his mother and use of his legs but the chance to defeat Dr Merkin and be the hero kids need The animation department was never given the funding they needed to begin with but also suffered a "computer virus" that required them to turn in their machines to the police The resulting CGI was about 5 years behind its time and couldnt grab kids attention The characters were barely likeable to boot Takeshi was a nerd and his main job was to do technical stuff for the group and he didnt even get a cool weapon Not that the weapons were terribly cool with Disney trying their best to avoid anything too gun-like (the red Bugchaser had a fucking flyswatter) Johnny had been replaced after 3 episodes meaning they reshot a couple scenes where they could redubbed lines and ultimately cut a lot of material featuring that character I was the most well liked character by far being the zany little scuzzball that I was My mom was fucking the producer so I think my character got a little bit more to work with That and how my character played off of Melissa You know how Nickelodeon producer Dan Schneider has a little girl foot fetish? Our producer Mitch Michaels had a sticky little girl fetish It was only mildly noticeable on screen maybe her shirt was just slick enough with green slime to make out her bra line maybe it was the way she spit taked the slug mucous but it was way worse on set Mitch put way too much time into reshooting these scenes which often required multiple wardrobe changes (just off set too not in a dressing room) I wont bore you with those details because there was also quite a bit of racism on set Aside from the very on-the-nose casting of an Asian kid as the yellow Bugchaser Johnny had it worse as an African American Takeshi was typecast as a nerd but Johnny was supposed to be the bad boy with a very negative thug like personality They didnt change it because of complaints though no they changed it when Mitch was informed that much like the red power ranger the red Bugchaser was sure to be the most popular Thats when the one black kid was essentially demoted from red to blue When Johnny 1 was replaced by Johnny 2 and they were forced to do reshoots and edits something was said to the effect of "theyll never even notice if its a different black kid theyre all the same" All he saw was a black face filling a roll; he even started making us call eachother by our character names off camera until there was no Johnny 1 and Johnny 2 but just Johnny I dont even remember the original Johnnys real name But I do remember the money shots So Melissa was being pushed into increasingly sticky situations with way more takes of spare footage than any slapstick gag deserved Mitch insisted that they were the main selling point of the show and even started using the term "money shot" each episode On the episode after the midseason finale we were supposed to fight an invisible spider bug in the "dark web" The solution was for me to spray glow in the dark slime on it so the others could see it The prop gun was a unique custom build that was way more important than the modified supersoakers I was used to (the premise was that we had janky Kids Next Door style gear that was "digimorphed" into cool equipment when we went through the portal) I wasnt allowed to goof around on set with this custom prop because it had to function just so Melissa walked on the set and was given the half assed setup of blowing dust off of her diary (there was a subplot there about stealing it losing it in the cyber zone then having to go back and fight some dust bunnies for it or whatever) it gets blown in my face I sneeze and accidentally set off the glow goo gun This squirted a thick creamy rope of pale colored goo directly on her face She tastes it "Is this frosting?" End scene There was a hushed murmur around the room as Mitch stood there almost wheezing He had the type of face that a starving man gives a hibachi chef as he waits for a shrimp to get tossed his way There wasnt a second take the scene died on the cutting room floor without ever being matched with a laugh track; it died as stark and naked as Melissas innocence We were all hurried out of the studio by flustered parents whose reaction made us feel a sort of nervous shame The cumshot heard around our world The show was cancelled shortly thereafter having only half a season air Mitch was fired and there was a huge class action lawsuit based around a pedophilia case The computers that were taken by the authorities had child porn on them many of which were pictures of child actors My mom got too full of herself and wouldnt take the settlement insisting on a lead role for me instead but her mouth couldnt influence them nearly the way it influenced Mitch My role was half voiceover work and my character usually wore goggles even in the real world so my face was mostly forgettable This would be the end of my show business career until my work on an adult film set years later but thats a different story,SpaceCowboy58,16196352670,4082

gw8bpax,n0jxcp,My Fanfic where Stringer Bell Beady and Frank Sabotka Dont die and instead are put into witness protection in Dunder Mifflin Frank Sabotka and Stringer Bell are the same character in both shows same attitude same vocal cadence Stringer finished business school and although he says he came from the steel industry it is really a cover because he came from the drug game Which is why Jim is too imitated to ask what a run down is When Charles Minor says he knows of the affect he has on women he is referring to his casual hook up with Danglo Barksdales Baby Mama Beady had a full mental breakdown dealing with the PTSD from the murder case which was made worse by McNultys sleeping and drinking around So after getting out of the asylum and being put into witness protection she assumes a new more fun loving personality She also knows who Stringer Bell and Frank Sabotka are but has been informed not to interact with them as to keep them both more safe Which is why one of the only times they are near each which is at the Company Picnic they never interact Frank Sabotka who is use to being a union leader is floored that Scranton Branch would have the audacity to encroach on their territory But the reason they are all put into Dunder Mifflin is more sinister The line in the wire "Everyone gets paid and everyone stays friends" is the most important line We see this with Lt Daniels and Barell But this isnt the only corruption With the FBI downsizing the narcotics division there is less over sight and people Making conspiracy easier to do So the FBI is using seized money from their raids but didnt report and funneling it through Dunder Mifflin to launder it We know this because when Kevin has money laundering explained to him he has to have it explained several times and "It sounds like what I do everyday" Because even though Scranton should be the least profitable branch because their productivity is abysmal and their best Salesmen Dwight is actually very abrasive and would be a terrible salesmen Is moving crazy amounts of paper I dont have the numbers infront of me rights now But if you were to compare the amount of sales all the sales staff makes and the flow of units through Darrells warehouse you are way outselling what a warehouse of that size would be able too do If you do the math of the Willy Wonka episode the Blue Cross of Pennsylvanias post wining the 50% off would be more than then what that warehouse could handle in itself not too mention all the other accounts So you could say Camden yutika buffalo etc are picking up the slack But if that were really true why does the company go bankrupt? Its because once the money is washed by Dunder Mifflin its funneled back into the crooked cops at the FBI Who then pay off the board of Dunder Mifflin But then because corporate can no longer be the scape goat for the lack of money because bankruptcy because of miss management has already been used They have find a new a reason In comes Saber Jo seems real good at here job really to good Divorcee who is able to grow an eastern seaboard printer empire large enough to gobble up a mid sized paper company and launch a tablet When the paper quality is bad The tablet is bad 50L wtf? And the printers start fires Its because they are all being as cheaply made as possible to keep as much money as possible post laundering But as she starts to catch on the FBI has to send in their best Robert California The FBI realizes the mistake they made in the original plan with too many kick backs and hush money to a large board One person is easier and one of your own is easier as well Robert and his wife are both FBI Agents but their divorce and kid are very real The stress of living a double life and going through a divorce becomes too much So they go to their next plan which is a modified version of their first and second plan And have David Wallace come back in to take charge but he is still on the payroll The other people that know about the scheme because they are on the payroll is Angela Kevin and Oscar They are their soft fist enforcers Angela not only keeps Dwight thinking that he is great salesmen and that all his sales are legitimate but also when the Senator catches on to what is happening they use her and Oscar as blackmail to keep him inline so that he isnt outed as gay and they dont have to add him to the payroll Kevin is not dumb its an act Nobody who is able to win the world series of poker and is able to do crazy mental math but only with pies would make the mistakes Kevin makes He is covering up and the fall guy for most the laundering Which is why he ends up having a successful bar after hes fired Kelevin the chili the personality quirks associated with eating food are all an act to make the rest of the office think hes dumb Angela and Oscar play up this act by being always annoyed and vocal about his alleged short comings "Everyone Stays Friends Everyone Gets Paid",rockets4Jesus,16196508120,2

Not only that but if you get in on the crypto market right now there are some coins which might offer up to 1000% returns so if you drop this $400 which isnt doing anything for you into these 3 crypto currencies either one of them or all three of them could pop off over a series of large pumps hopefully through companies like Amazon or Facebook deciding to invest leaving you with thousands of dollars in profit!",hondac55,16196597070,2

gw7irv3,n0jxcp,> No no no no no hear me out So this was at the beginning of Batmans career right so hes fighting the Joker the first appearance hes made since falling into the Ace Chemicals vat but Supermans been around for a while in this continuity So Batman gets shot and because hes inexperienced hes not able to protect himself properly ends with him being paralysed has to be in a wheelchair Unfortunately no amount of money is ever going to be able to heal him so he decides he has to give up being the Batman Lois Lane comes over from Metropolis to interview him about it but because Alfred went in to pick him up before the police arrived nobody knows hes Batman yet Jimmy Olsen goes around Wayne Manor since its going to be a televised interview so hes looking for a good place to put the shot Alfred steps out to assist Bruce and in the meantime Olsen gets free reign of the Wayne Manor Drawing Room You know where this is going He plays some random notes on the piano as hes dicking about and suddenly the grandfather clock swings open and he finds a passage down into the Batcave > Alfred comes back tells him to keep it a secret and to return to the Manor that night so that they can explain themselves It takes a bit of convincing but he does show up because you know Batman Hes explained the situation and told that if he wants to release the story he can they just want a little bit more time to prepare to tell the public about it knowing that with Bruce Waynes injury and Batmans disappearance coinciding it wont take long for people to connect the dots So Jimmy walks home feeling a bit sad about the whole situation and then he gets abducted because hes a nerd with a camera walking alone at night in Gotham Hey thats kinda like whats happening now! Anyway so he was kidnapped by Dr Kirk Langstrom which should be a familiar name if you know anything about Batman and he tests a very early prototype of the Man-Bat formula on Jimmy at a time where the formula is still in development Jimmy uses his signal watch he was given by Superman to call for help and sure enough the Man of Steel charges in and saves the day > Now theres one thing you have to know about Jimmy Olsen; he often gets transformed into different things So for DC logic hes likely got a metagene that means hes capable of adapting to genetic modification better So yeah Langstrom fucking dies because he thinks the formula used on Jimmy was stable when it wasnt Jimmy returns to Metropolis keeping Bruce Waynes secret from everyone Over the next week he starts getting stronger and faster and he develops super sonic hearing his reflexes get better he basically becomes Daredevil if Daredevil could see and was a photographer who was an aspiring journalist He gets a call from Bruce Wayne asking to see him as Langstrom was an employee of Waynetech before he went rogue and when he visits Wayne Manor the Bat-Signal flares up Jimmy stares at it for a moment noticing Bruces discontentment with being unable to do anything and he excuses himself for the bathroom but actually runs down to the Batcave to put on a Batsuit and steal the Batmobile > After an awkward conversation with Gordon on top of the GCPD building he rushes over to the hostage situation at the Gotham Gazette He finds out Victor Zsasz is up to his old serial killer tricks again having locked everyone inside and he has to be discrete about how he takes down Zsasz which is not something Jimmys been trained for Bruce however having noticed Jimmys obvious absence directs him in taking down the maniac and while many died and many more were traumatised Jimmy Olsen Batman saved the day But he gets scolded by Wayne and told never to do something as reckless as that again although Alfred thanks him on both of their behalves shortly afterward After he returns once again to Metropolis he keeps reading news from over in Gotham and finds that too much is happening there for him to be able to stay away He applies for a job at the Gazette and sees Superman off at the airport having been informed at some point by Bruce that hes actually Clark Kent He gets the job as a reporter gets approval from Bruce to be a new Batman and the rest is history > So yeah it turns out Jimmy Olsen Batman ends up being a way better Batman than Bruce could ever have been Hes not a billionaire he spent a long time as collateral damage of a superheros fights so he values civilians a lot more and the separation of Bruce Wayne and Batman allow Bruce to be a much better parent to Dick Grayson who still becomes Robin but never loses his respect in either his adoptive father or the Batman Jason Todd gets sent to live in an orphanage in Fawcett City where he becomes a member of the family Shazam Joker never quite gets cured but over time the difference Jimmy makes actually does change him some and he gains moments of clarity enough even to share wisdom with a young Tim Drake about his time as the Red Hood prompting Tim to become the new Red Hood and then it turns out that actually Talia Al Ghul slid into Jimmy Olsens tinder DMs in a real Superman comic so if hes Batman of course theyre going to bone She might not have meant to have a kid with him but I mean the kid would have superpowers And Damian does he gets enormous Bat-wings even and becomes a young Nightwing named after a story Superman once told Jimmy about the heroes of Krypton Lots of stuff changes but mainly Gotham changes as Jimmy Olsens impact as Batman is just far far better than any other versions has been Because he treats his villains with compassion and of course as the Editor for the Gazette he ensures the town is keeping a lot more honest than it used to > Wait why are you kicking me out you havent heard my pitch for a Victor Zsasz fights the Question movie spinoff!,Gate4043,16196381130,1

gw7j9pv,n0jxcp,Horror movies Mainly The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) directed by Tobe Hooper Oh my god I love that movie Its so God Damn good! The ending when Sally escapes in the back of the truck by just a hair and shes caked in blood and screaming/laughing/crying at the same time is just utterly fantastic and by far my favorite piece of film Ive ever seen I literally get goosebumps just thinking about how effective the crying and laughing is at the same time Shes crying because all of her friends were just murdered and shes been through a night of torture and depravity in the Texas heat but is so glad to have escaped that house that she cant help but laugh And in the opening title crawl it says she sank into catatonia after this event which leads me to believe she stayed in that state of shock just crying and laughing constantly never saying a word again as long as she lives If you take anything away from this post please sit down (smoke a joint if you like to do so) and just watch The Texas Chainsaw Massacre It just pulls me in and captivates me every single time! And Ive seen it well over 100 times It was actually the first movie I ever bought as a kid with my own money and boy how it has impacted my life Also one of the great things about the movie is that its so terrifying and gratuitous and disturbing yet theres hardly any blood in it I know youre probably thinking "What?!" Thats right though There really isnt a lot of blood in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre A lot of the gore is implied but when you think back it feels like you just watched a bloodbath Thats how effective it is at just being purely scary and terrifying your mind fills in the lack of gore with shocking images Best Movie Ever,bloodyFNgore13,16196383260,1

gyglaju,nehqa9,Textbook checkouts were an absolute shit show They were assigned entirely by number and condition They were not assigned to a specific student As long as you turned in a textbook at the end of the year and the textbook number was on the list that was the first step to being ok The second step was condition The textbooks were graded as new good fair and poor If the book was returned in a lesser condition than when it was checked out you had to pay for a new textbook This included condition changes from new to good yet we almost never got new textbooks The ones we had were usually around 10 years old so they went through at least 3 condition changes over their lifespan It was pure extortion You had to pay for the textbook at the end of the year and if you didnt theyd keep you from advancing So that sucks right? That compounded with another stupid rule we had Lockers were not allowed to be locked In fact our lockers didnt even have a latch; they were just painted wood "doors" that were really just poorly installed flaps that would hang open This was ultimately so the cops could check everyones lockers for drugs but it led to another issuestolen textbooks So the textbooks were generally falling apart and we were expected to both keep them with us for class and also bring them home with us for homework We also didnt want them stolen so most students kept them in their backpacks constantly For every class This was a rural school too so most students had a decent walk home even from bus stops (mine was about a mile) Point being the textbooks were abused as were our backs and backpacks So you start with a poor condition textbook and add the extra wear and tear and its just a matter of time before the cover rips off So those with shit textbooks would just grab one from whatever exposed locker had one As long as the student was in the same class as you its fair game In case you were wondering where the money went it went into new awnings every year for the exterior doorways and into our famously bad football team Our girls teams were a bunch of champions and never got and respect for it The school only cared about out shitty football team They would go entire seasons without a single win,JadedNostalgic,16212682810,322
gyggetu,nehqa9,My school was in a poor area of Rio de Janeiro Brazil Not a lot of schools here have money for anything Because of a huge donation of books at the time I was in school my school got an absurd number of books including expensive ones There were a few dumb rules but the dumbest of them all? We basically couldnt touch the books in the library without permission It might sound reasonable at first but check this out The library was huge and there were lots of books including contemporary classics non-fiction like The Last Problem English Literature like Infinite Jest How to kill a Mockingbird and whatnot Dude there was so much there that place was probably the most valuable place in the entire school I mean it was awesome there were enough books there for each student to lend about 100 every day Heres the problem the library went all but untouched for the entirety of my time there Why? The amount of work it took to read one of those books was ridiculous and pretty much made sure not a single student bothered to try First you couldnt take any of the books home period Forget the fact that they had your address and all your parents info so in the case that someone took it and didnt return it they could just get it back - it had happened before at least once before the rule was made Second you couldnt leave the library with them no matter what Third if you wanted to read the book youd have to do it in the library at the lunch break which was about 45 minutes so unless you werent hungry ever you had only a few minutes to go to the library It was only open for a few hours around the break and not at all at any other time so unless you stayed there for hours until the break for the afternoon classes you just wouldnt have another chance (Those hours around the break could be used for you to be tutored by a teacher which almost never happened) Fourth once you went through all of that you could only read the book under the observation of the people that volunteered to work in the library for credit which was never more than two or three people sometimes no one Which means that if you got there and there were already three people there forget it Unless you were willing to read it standing up close to where the book was kept and even then theyd check on you every minute or so Fifth you couldnt get inside the library with a backpack with food in groups speaking without the appropriate uniform - you couldnt get in with the gym one for instance - with other books earrings necklaces or anything that could make noise while you were walking Some were reasonable but the issue was that one simple mistake and you would get banned Sixth any banishment from it was permanent I complained about it once in the second year and was never allowed inside ever again I even tried to get some teachers to help me but it didnt work Seventh and probably the dumbest only the students that had a certain amount of high grades could get any book at all If you got something like 4/10 on your last biology exam you couldnt even get inside the library The standard was so insane only six other students and I in my classroom had enough good grades to get books In all my time there the library was basically deserted for the majority of it I tried to go there many times but it was too much work Out of all the books I only managed to read two Brazilian ones "A guerra do lanche" (The lunch war) and "Blecaute" (Blackout) which I remembered to this day in details There were times where I legit thought about straight up ditching class to read some of them I tried to get more like The Last Problem Kafkas Metamorphosis Ulisses - which I know I wouldnt have been able to do it but I was just curious - A brief story of time Wuthering Heights etc But the amount of work it took was so much that it was just almost impossible to be able to read more than one or two books a year and even that took dedication because I basically had to sacrifice part of my lunch time The rumor was that the principals* - we had more than one - basically saw us as "savages" who would destroy the books if we were allowed to touch them and even though they had no reason to believe so - the library worked well without those restrictions a year before I had gotten there with only minimal incidents and even those didnt result in the books getting destroyed **TL:DR; My school made it very hard to read the huge amount of books they had**,Lufernaal,16212662530,6402

gyhuiww,nehqa9,Went to a private school that hand a strict uniform policy So strict that if you turned up wearing socks that did not have the school logo on them you got detention for the entire day so no morning or lunch breaks for you This was because "what you wear affects your learning" The stupid thing about it all was the school uniform shop charged - and this is not a exaggeration - $20 for ONE pair of socks with the school logo on them This meant that some kids only had one or two pairs so when they got changed for PE - gawd the smell was bad Lots of kids had infections Finally - one student who can from a single parent Asian background and he was quiet poor (his mother worked 50 hour weeks sometimes 60 hours to send him there) ended up getting his cousin or other relative back home to ship over to him 300 pairs of socks with the school logo on them for a total of $300 He sold them to the other kids on the side for a $150 a pair We didnt even care that he was making money the kid needed the $450 He used the money to give his mum a spa day and brought groceries for the entire fortnight so she could rest Granted - one stuck up trust fund prick of a student had to be a snitch about it all So then the school did a audit of the number of socks they had sold and started going through the camera footage of the uniform shop to find out who had brought the socks and who hadnt Finally they gathered probably 200+ kids and their parents into the school hall to have a discussion about "how selling off brand products damages the entire school" AFTER they had sent out a letter to all parents saying that the school had $0 debt and was on track to fully fund the construction of a new theatre by the end of the financial year They did this with a stall set up outside the hall selling the socks for $25 as "due to the loss in revenue we had to review the prices" It took one parent to just say that their kid brought them second hand - and if that was all they would be going home for dinner School dropped the price of the school socks to $100 to undercut that kid shortly afterwards and stopped being anal about enforcing uniform policy for socks,Three-Nations,16212874040,5
gykaa42,nehqa9,Im a teacher and I want to talk about the dumbest rule I ever had to enforce I was asked to do some long term work at a school I was super happy because this meant I would get my first contract When you are doing your first big job you want to make a good impression right? The teacher I was replacing was away on sick leave so I didnt get much explanation about the rules or day-to-day features of the class A week into my contract I found on there was a nutrition policy/program at the school For some background when schools put things like this into place its because schools (unfortunately) are in competition with each other They want to get the most kids to register at their school So when its open house they can say "well we have these programs!" or "WE VALUE NUTRITION!" We were expected to go around at recess time and look at the kids lunches and see if they were nutritious or not If I remember correctly I needed to give like a "well done" sticker if it was a nutritious or "please bring a healthy snack" if it wasnt This is one of those things that seems okay in theory but in reality it just made me feel crummy Why? a) The kids dont necessarily have any control of what gets put into their lunches so I am essentially giving them a "bad" sticker for something they have no control over b) Due to the socio economic situation of some of the families they didnt necessarily have money for a healthy snack c) I didnt like policing what other people were eating I knew I wasnt going to be there long so I sorta turned a blind eye when kids ate stuff that wasnt the healthiest It worked most of the time Except once a little girl was eating a whole damn slice of cake and another student finked on her,holyhobo12,16213424160,4

gyizk50,nehqa9,damn where do i begin? 1 School uniforms When i was in elementary school (1st or 2nd grade) students that were in middle and high school were enforced to wear a specific set of uniforms Polos with dress pants now there were options for a few colors but not many mostly neutrals and school colors however the way it was enforced was stupid polos were required to be tucked in at all times with a single warning if you were caught after was a 15 min detention If the dress pants had belt loops you were required to wear a belt if you didnt youd be sent home from school for the day They marketed this to the parents as a prevention of gang activity but we all knew that was BS as we were in the middle of nowhere What makes it worse is incoming middle school students are sent to a "uniform sale" where they can buy the proper uniforms to wear to school (pretty sure the schools are getting a kickback on that) Thankfully these sales are doing worse as many students go buy there uniforms from exterior stores 2 Students were required to sign in and out for bathroom breaks This wasnt enforced very well and was very hit and miss as some teachers didnt give a damn what we did if we left the class the hardass teachers required students to carry a large wooden tag that said "BATHROOM" on it and forced students to sign in and out with the times The school made the excuse of students made a mess in the bathrooms daily and they needed to know who was doing it even though the custodian was basically guarding the bathrooms 3 No straw By far the strangest rule ive ever seen The senior prank was year was placing straw down in a few select classes to as they were specifically senior classes school didnt take to kindly to the prank and proceeded to file B&E charges on the pranksters (charges eventually were dropped out of anger from parents as this was a standard tradition) the pranks from then on were banned Thankfully some justice came from that as a year later the principal was busted for money laundering (kind of ironic) i could probably think of a few more but those were the big three,Cp2017,16213078060,2

(Even though pretty much everyone in the local area had kids at the school at some point or actually went to the school themselves and knew exactly what was going on) So firstly she changed the year 11 students uniform to a black sweatshirt forcing our parents to fork out more money for just one year of uniform and hoping that the sweatshirt would now be impossible to sign She hired actual security guards to stand at the school gates on the last day to stop any students who decided to dress up anyway Turned out that pretty much every single student in my year myself included chose to dress up anywayor just waited until they were in headed straight to the bathrooms and got dressed up there A few students brought boxes of gold and silver pens to sign the black uniforms with and were handing them around Students were sneaking in through holes in the fences to get inside Even some of the teachers still joined in It got to the point where she was doing bag checks and assigning security to stand outside bathrooms etc We would have a special leavers assembly at some point in the day and I can just remember her standing at the doors to the assembly hall desperately trying to stop those who were dressed up from getting in and everyone just walking past her Honestly this woman had an actual full blown tantrum and stormed off She was supposed to speak during the assembly but she didnt show up and we were told she was refusing to come At the end of the day one of the students managed to climb on top of the roof above her office and erected (lol pun intended) a 6 foot inflatable penis and along the shaft he had written insert head teachers name hereis a knob! Which apparently took them ages to get down because teachers arent quite as spry as a 16 year old boy who somehow managed to get onto the roof  We had to come back a few days later for our year photo which meant we all stood on bleachers in the gym and had our class photo taken except it was our entire year At the time there were about 250 students in my year All of our teachers sat along the front of the photo on chairs The head teacher was supposed to sit front and centre We had all been standing and waiting in position for her to appear for quite some time and when she eventually did people started hissing at herjust a low hiss that spread until pretty much everyone was hissing and booing her like a pantomime villain She just turned around and left and later had to be photo shopped into the photo Now Im not strictly condoning this kind of behaviour the booing and the giant inflatable penis were a bit much and as an adult I realise this I also understand certain rules have to be enforced sometimes students would bring alcohol in on the last day and teachers would be on the gates to confiscate it and I get that completely But even as an adult I look back and just cant understand her reasoning for many of the rules she put in place Her main goal seemed to be to just make things difficult and miserable for everyone and in the face of harmless fun she was a black cloud over us all She left not long after and I sometimes think about what she went on to do If she ever reads this sorrybut also kind of not sorry,Fluid_Assignment837,16213256050,2
gyko3s7,nehqa9,No going to lockers between classes Only at the start of the day end of the day and beginning/end of lunch hour We were supposed to have a notebook and folder for each class So that would mean youre supposed to carry around at least 3 textbooks 3 notebooks and 3 folders If you had band you also had an instrument to carry around half the day If you had gym your gym clothes Etc If the temperature changed during the day you couldnt get or put away a jacket The school had four floors So you were potentially carrying all that up/down four floors Most years my class immediately before lunch was on the top floor the cafeteria was on the bottom We could only "move around" for the first half of lunch hour; ie wherever you were at the 30 minute mark you were supposed to stay there If I stopped to go to my locker before getting in the lunch line Id be at the end of the line and I wouldnt get my lunch until after this 30 minute mark (and so was supposed to stay in the cafeteria) If you had something you had to do on lunch hour - detention work to do in the library (this was before most people had computers at home) or whatever that would screw you over So those of us with class on the top floor immediately before lunch would often just have to take our books with us to lunch I started just leaving my textbooks in the class they were for This should have been the standard but I guess the school made more money by having us each rent one Because yeah we had to rent textbooks,s0nicfreak,16213488350,2

h1axnui,nwpf1a,Found out I have two roots on one of my very front top tooth (dont know what its called) but apparently its extremely rare The way I found this out was pretty unpleasant So I used to not take care of my teeth when I was younger because I didnt really know how/how important it was and I was also severely depressed and didnt take care of myself too well Went to the dentist and they said I needed a root canal on this tooth and they did it After the anesthesia wore off it felt like someone stabbed me in the mouth the pain was unbearable so I went back and they told me "Wow it looks like you actually have two roots in this tooth! This is super rare but youll have to go to a root canal specialist to take care of this!" So I find a root canal specialist and tell the guy what happened and he starts ranting "You definitely dont have two roots in that tooth these general dentists dont know what theyre talking about I went to school for two more years training specifically to do root canals and these dentists think they can do it all! They probably messed up and now they send you to me Always go to a root canal specialist blah blah blah" which made me think this guy kinda regretted spending all that money for two extra years of school He also stabbed the fuck out of the roof of my mouth with the needle which traumatized me for years after because he was not delicate at all and just kept stabbing After he finished he was like "Wellturns out you actually did have two roots in that tooth" Cue look of disapproval After that anytime I go to a new dentist and they take x-rays theyre like "Holy shit this guys got two roots on number [whatever]!

gzwdrgw,nns8ge,I grew up somewhere that gets very cold and dark in the winter months In my mid 20s I worked for a medium sized local bank that had bought an even smaller bank Right before close during a snow storm a woman came in with really old financial documents that smelled of mildew She claimed her husband had accounts with the current bank and that she needed all the money out and close accounts Problem was the paperwork she had was not for either of the banks described and her husband was not in the system Then she proceeded to tell us how her husband had died after being attacked by a werewolf who was actually her husbands brother And that her husband was also a werewolf She claimed she needed the money for protection After muttering a little more and randomly walking around the lobby agitated she left Luckily my manager was really cool and dealt with talking with her and I was a bystander but it was still a very weird thing to hear especially under the circumstances Gave bad vibes for sure,Ortuatra,16223154270,4100
gzy88yb,nns8ge,Alright I created a whole new goddamn account to tell this story so blow it up or whatever Back about a decade ago I was in a bar on an island in Nicaragua Saddled up for a siesta beer or three next to some other expat who was already at the bar and ended up spending a couple hours there shooting the shit Just me bartender 60yrold+ expat This dude gets deep in the sauce and starts telling me the wildest story Back in the 70s he worked in a pharma lab and was in charge of the animals Namely the pigs His job was to make sure they were fed and cared for and whatnot Well his favorite pig this big fucking buck hog got sick and he was told to put it down He couldnt so he pulls up late at night and packs it into the back of his pinto or whatever and takes it home to care for it He turns his living room into a pig sty and nurses this pig slowly back to health over several weeks Sleeping next to the pig caring for it hand feeding etc He loved this pig and wanted it to get better Me and the bartender are full into this story we are shooting some local eye-blinding moonshine at this point and getting into it This old hippy is just staring off into the distance and starts tearing up Says As it got better it you know got more and more aggressive It was a breeding pig and was use to rutting all the time and just kept getting worse and worse So he tried jacking it off to see if he could release some tension and that just didnt work Me and the poor bartender are just staring horrified and this dude with his thousand yard stare at the wall starts full on balling and says through sobs "I loved that pig so I just let him fuck me" There are no words for the emotion or facial expression that me and that bartender had This dude just starts sobbing uncontrollably saying over and over that he let this pig fuck him Between sobs he finishes the story They found out he took the pig and sent security in to take the pig away from him and because he had it outside the lab for so long and umm other stuff They fucking euthanized the pig and fired the guy (obviously) I didnt know what to do So I just put some money on the counter flashed the bartender a terrified look and walked away Leaving that poor dude just head down sobbing on the bar top And you know As much as that story is really fucked he had been carrying that shit around for 40 years I hope telling it brought that dude some kind of peace fin,hdjskbsbjnd,16223554050,26
gzys60c,nns8ge,So I dont know if this is entirely on point Thirty years ago I was working in the Seychelles as a consular officer You can imagine I was young in my twenties and it was pretty sleepy Old rich guy loses his passport Sailor gets sick Child of US citizens born One day this guy comes in I read him as just a boat bum: ruffled hair deep tan oft-mended sailors shorts And so he was: a boat bum sailing around the world on a pittance in a rough little sail boat I invite him into my office (this was pre-9/11 security was more relaxed) offer him coffee (this is the Seychelles) and ask what I can do for him He warms up by telling me hed left LA a year and a half ago sailing slowly across the Pacific "So what can I do for you sir?" I ask and he replies: "I needed to introduce myself to you Somebody is trying to kill me and if it happens you will immediately know who did it Because I will tell you right now" It turns out that he was in Tahiti at some anchorage and there was an American couple there too and as sailors do they got chummy It was a couple an older guy and a younger "cute" wife/girlfriend He soon learned she was the girlfriend So they fraternized there he sailed on they got to another island in Polynesia ran into each other again and one night he brought over a special bottle of scotch and between the wine of the couple and my interlocutors scotch they get pretty hammered start talking about life how they got into sailing etc At some point the husband goes below deck and the girlfriend starts telling him how they *really* got to achieve their dream of sailing to Bora Bora The older man/husband had been a businessman in San Francisco Hed bought their boat with a boat partner "Way more boat than he could afford but with a boat partner you get twice the boat right?" They were friends in the same circles in SF So once they get the boat the older guy convinces his boat partner that he intends to sail to Alaska so they trick it out for blue water cruising spend almost a year doing this Then one day its all ready its the guys turn to take the boat for a week out into the Pacific and he dumps his wife picks up his girlfriend loads a ton of provisions up and sets sail for the Galapagos Islands (!) So basically hes just stolen his boat partners half of his sailboat At this point the older dude comes back on deck (he was below decks remember) hes pissed that his girlfriend has let the cat out of the bag Its not immediately clear how pissed but as the night rolls on the guy in my office in Seychelles realizes that the older dude is trying to steer him into thinking the girlfriend was joking then figure out how long he was going to be at that anchorage then where he was going next He starts getting this weird vibe "Like this guy was going to kill me" At first they tried to turn it into a joke The boat partner in SF was rich He wouldnt miss the money Hed collect insurance Theyd never find the boat as the boat partner would peg him in the Pacific Northwest because hed never discussed a circumnavigation Then it got pretty dark Pretty scary And my interlocutor begins to realize this is not a good situation He knows too much and hes in the middle of nowhere with these people who have robbed a half-million dollar boat and could easily make him disappear Long story short He rows back to his own boat Sleeps uneasily In the morning the formerly friendly vibe has gotten really ugly with the other couple Not just ugly But scary The girlfriend looks super scared when they talk again Invites continue but theyre really weird hes just being pumped for information like theyre trying to get him drunk like they want to know if they can convince him to sail with them someplace isolated A wind came up in the afternoon when they were ashore My man just sails right out of the anchorage And for the next six months as he sails from Polynesia then south and west he finds out theyre chasing him through the islands They chase him for a year all the way through Indonesia and the Indian Ocean to Diego Garcia So in Seychelles he visits me with a simple message He gave me an envelope with the name of the couple (as he knew their name and he thought it was right but he wasnt sure) And he told me theyd been catching up with him Hed heard through the grapevine theyd asked for him at Diego Garcia (A US navy base which tolerates sailors going through) He didnt trust "the authorities" but he was willing to take a chance on me If I didnt get a postcard from Cape Town within sixty days I was to assume he was murdered contact his family and report the name of the boat and his pursuers to the authorities About two months later I got his postcard from South Africa So I knew he survived At least until Capetown,The_whimsical1,16223744590,27

gzwyzyc,nns8ge,**The Sad Story of Crazy Sara** If youre out there reading this Im sorry Sara was hired at my pub and had to be the most candidly fucked up person Ive met On her very first shift she came out and told everyone that the toilet was clogged and someone had to go fix it because she had anxiety We were like wtf and she kind of laughed and put her hand on her head and said something like "this is so embarrassing but Im bulimic and I had kind of a big lunch and I didnt realize the plumbing was so bad here I dont know anything about plumbing or where the tools are and its pretty embarrassing so I think you should do it" What Pardon me Did you just Oh okay then Change the subject On her next shift she began giving orders to other servers to the bartender and the support staff to do things She had to be reminded her own log-in code three times but felt the need to comment on how cocktails should be made And worse she was wrong about half of her suggestions so everyone was third-party embarrassed correcting her about anything meant you would have to prolong the discussion so people just bit their cheeks She reorganized parts of the restaurant nobody asked her to and then complained about having to put it back when the manager asked her why she was disorganizing the restaurant on the clock? She was straight up cunty with people on the phone low-tippers and even the owner She was pretty and seemed normal enough until you spend time with her She kind of looked like Ariana Grande when she was a Disney tv starlet but short and a little thic Nice big smile and soft voice but utterly insane Imagine on your second day at work telling the woman whos been there 20 years that shes not doing something correctly; balls of steel I asked if she wanted to stay for a drink after work at which point she accepted and then walked out on the bill which I covered She told me she had to run because shed signed up for a Sugar Babys account and was meeting with a potential client and hoped this would work out because she was behind on rent and she only wanted to fuck ballers We were not on those kind of friendly terms we had probably talked about where shed worked previously and her hometown and then Bam More things nobody asked to know Smile and nod but Im just like what the fuck On our next and final shift together I show up to see she is eating two entire plates of food Like entrees She may as well have dislocated her jaw like a trap door thrown her head back and dumped the plates This was pretty awkward because a week ago shed announced to everyone during the meetngreets she was a raging bulimic and an escort and here she is eating roughly my 36hr caloric intake in a single sitting and Im not cleaning up her mess again So I just straight up asked her not necessarily in my indoor voice why she was eating so much if shed just told everyone she was going to throw it up She laughs and says "Oh well I decided to go back to being a chubby" and I was like alright cool but cant you just not binge-eat and not throw up and love your body and be healthy? These extremes are a little disturbing She laughed some more "No no its not about body image or anything its just that Ive got some new clients and a business model around seeing how fat I can get" She then went on into glorious detail about how lucrative it can be for a camgirl - my old manager was a camgirl and made 6 figures in a year as an entirely average-looking girl and I dont judge so I was like alright thats fine But then she described in all too graphic detail how many pounds she was projecting to gain per day and how folks were already sending her hundreds of dollars in tips for her to consume as much food as possible I later looked into this industry later on and realized she was right on the money (no pun intended) and theres millions of dollars floating around out there for girls who get chubby in realtime I only spoke with her briefly and left She got fired a couple hours later for doing coke in the bathroom and giving a BJ to one of our regulars whod just gotten married the day before which I found out the next day Hope youre having your best fat girl summer Sara and you should probably stick to what you know,josiahpapaya,16223262730,20

gzy3s3z,nns8ge,OK American English teacher in East Asian country About a year ago an older gentleman joined one of my classes Retired wealthy and bored He comes to a few classes and we have very innocuous conversations One day no one else shows up to the class and he asks can we just do a "free talk" session Since no one else was there I said sure We talk mostly about his business life and his philosophy on the subject I asked him why he retired and its a story I will never forget So he was completely focused on his business and barely saw his wife and two kids who were being raised in the US while he was in the China His son when he was a teenager started getting into trouble So he decided to bring him back to Shanghai where he was located Bought him an apartment and enough money to survive and basically left him to his own devices Obviously a 16 year old with a bunch of money and his own apartment you can guess the trouble he got into A few months into this arrangement and his son ends up knocking up an escort He tells his father who is none too pleased about this The girl starts asking for a money Well the father has connections to organized crime in China and has them pay her a visit Telling her that we will give a you an ungodly amount of money to abort the pregnancy Kind of a "You dont have a choice" situation if you know what I mean So the girl has the abortion and the son is sent back to the US Son apparently becomes depressed and gets very into drugs At one point he takes a hulking amount of pills in a suicide attempt The father rushes back to the US to see his son in the hospital He was in a coma for a few weeks When the son came to and they were talk the father asked why he had done this The son looked him straight in the eye and said "You killed my son so I wanted to kill yours" I was stunned Just absolutely floored that he was telling me any of this I really didnt even know what to say He told me that this was when he decided he needed to retire I went home after the class and immediately poured myself several glasses of Scotch to calm my nerves I wasnt ready for that story in an English class I can only guess that he never told this story to anyone else and it was a bit of a catharsis for him Anyways thank you for taking the time to read my story,daftwerk522,16223517020,7

gvqpg3p,mxf4dl,God UGH To all of you if you resonate with these comments PLEASE check this out! In order to have a fulfilling life and fulfilling connected relationships you have to work on your emotional side You cannot have passion for life or anything if youre emotions are suppressed and hidden away This can lead to depression and is often a symptom of emotional neglect ##what is emotional neglect? A majority of parents just want whats best for their children but some are abusive and neglectful in many more ways in addition to *emotional neglect* It is invisible and thus often overlooked in favor of treating physical abuse /neglect (understandably so) ^(I wont focus on this kind of abuse in this post because theres plenty of literature and understanding on trauma) It is certainly present in abusive homes but also can be present in homes where everything *looks* good For example parents are financially well-off nice home provide great nutrition the best clothes the best academic education and the best head start financially never spanked hit or witnessed domestic violence So its easy to assume people brought up like that had a "perfect" life However it is quite common that parents (whether with bad intentions or good intentions) are ill equipped to handle and support their child emotionally CPS wont spot these issues and cant really do anything about it because theres no physical scars or malnutrition to document ##Examples of Emotional neglect - Told to stay out of sight when youre upset /crying - Rarely hugged /cuddled - Told you were too emotional/dramatic - Always cheered up with money (new toy new clothes etc) - Told as a child that your problems didnt matter because your parent had SO much more going on than you - Being punished for having emotional reactions (Your favorite toy broke /got lost youre sad parents tell you to stop crying or youll get a time out etc) - If you werent happy and all smiles your parents would not want you around Theres many more examples but this really gives you a good idea These things might seem trivial or not a big deal and isolated occurrences arent a big deal However if this is how youre brought up Day in day out as a child over time youre taught that your emotions are to be suppressed hidden Youre taught that youre emotions make you unreasonable and wrong Slowly self esteem is chipped away and you might only feel proud when you get that new promotion or when you buy a new house But the feeling doesnt last #Symptoms of Emotional neglect - Low self confidence - sometimes a seemingly little thing can set your anger off - when something bothers you you dont say anything youd rather avoid uncomfortable situations - depression - anxiety - afraid that if you open up people will leave you - poor ability to maintain or develop habits - you often work until you burn out - you have difficulty resting being kind to yourself And more Needing nurture emotional support and unconditional love is part of being human and if that eas missing it affects you deeply Fortunately you can heal from this You can learn how to open up and pick up healthy habits You can feel fulfilled and at peace with who you are You can be happy This wont solve all your problems but recovering from this will make your financial problems relationship problems etc feel like you can tackle them without burning out ##Heres a few resources that might help you -

gvqrr4u,mxf4dl,So many comments who knows where to start My mom always making comments about the size of my boobs and how "disgusting" they are (I developed very young (10) and very busty fast) Probably a D in the 6th grade easily She never helped me to find a proper fitting bra Took my until I was 24 to find something that actually worked When I was 14 probably had DD we were going through the airport "Hey look! That girl has boobs as big as yours! Only shes not as fat" (I weighed 120 pounds) I still have major body image issues She constantly put herself down which of course made me feel the same about myself "Im too stupid to do anything right" "Im too fat" "Im too worthless"thats constantly a fight to not think to myself to this day (35 years old) My self esteem being so low I didnt try very hard in school Rubbed my face in how lazy I was I would cry constantly and was just never comforted or asked what was wrong I even remember hearing her telling my step dad that "shes just a psycho-despresso" I called her out on it She still denies ever saying that Kids were nasty to me in school Apparently some of the stuff I told her on what they would do or say to her made her cry but I dont ever remember her comforting me (Ive blocked out so much of school) teachers never did anything nor my parents My sister would do similar stabs at me Everyone at school my mom sister and brother would always call me chinese and I absolutely hated it I was born with a lazy eye and had corrective surgery that made them more almond shaped but they dont really look asian yet everyone said that (super non diverse area btw Almost no other ethnicity except natives in the state) I would break down when constantly picked on about it Naturally I would be bitter and angry about so much of this Then I was constantly a "bitch" People didnt like me because of my attitude My stepdad hated me and would put me down Complain to my mom how I never would talk to him then she would tell at me about it Rarely stood up for me Did a few times tho When my parents split I immediately chose to live with dad (Im actually super lucky because my parents always and still do have a good relationship with each other and wasnt in anyway a messy divorce) I chose him for a chance to restart at a different school I adore my dad and look up to him so much His flaws are hes a procrastinator He likes to avoid conflicts as well I never thought of how much he avoids conflict It was to an unhealthy degree in my opinion One time our neighbors were shooting at our dogs with a 22 because they were barking at their horse (at the horses feet and scaring it and being fairly aggressive but not biting it) something told me dont go in the field to get them so I stood at the fence yelling at them (which never works) so neighbor starting shooting at them then turned and took a shot at me It was EXTREMELY intentional because it had to be a 30 yard difference to a hard right so not like I was in front or behind them The bullet hit maybe 2 feet from my feet in front of me The bullet ricocheted and came up and hit the right sleeve of my jacket missing the meat of my bicep by inches I went home and told my dad and showed him my coat He said "if he would have hit you I would have went over there and kicked his ass!!" But he never called the cops or even so much ad went and had a talk with them My dad also didnt comfort me when I was upset Which was often I was in an abusive relationship I tried to leave him but when I was packing he threw my snake on the bed and pulled out a gun to shoot him if I left Neither of my parents did anything to help get me out of there The guy would randomly threaten to kill himself and pulled the gun out from time to time I was stuck in that relationship for 4 years but got out eventually (under my own strength and will power) I was hospitalized for 4 days due to a poisonous snake bite (not my pet snakes of course) I told my mom I lost 15 pounds because of the bite and if I died she would have gotten a lot of money from my life insurance She told me I should go roll in a pit of snakes them Also told me I should have been an abortion then laugh It was actually a joke but it still hurt Of course this is all just some of it There is plenty of other actions that happened too Both my parents are actually very caring and I love them but these are things that still bother me greatly to this day I limit my interaction with my mom because she is a pretty negative person I live 2000 miles from them and rarely go home partly due to it being expensive to get there Ive always been fiercely independent and didnt want to rely on them trying to make them proud But it also worked out to get away I would say the worst thing that was ever said to me was nothing I know this was long I apologize If you actually finished reading this I thank you,snake-lady-2005,16192941420,8

gvp5ybr,mxf4dl,This will probably get buried now that Ive missed the party but I guess I can vent It certainly isnt as bad as most of whats here Right after I graduated from high school I was pretty close to burnout Id gone to a mixed boarding school and day school in a different state filled mostly with people I disliked At my peak Id studied for 13 hours a day which just detroyed me I had spoken at length with them about having a gap year (instead of going to uni immediately) for months before graduation only for my mum to say to me "Oh I though you were joking" and my dad to say "Really? I just thought you were being dramatic People your age are like that" When I made it clear I was serious my mum screamed at me for about 25 minutes ranting about how much money theyd wasted on me and how I was too lazy to even pass in uni even if I went before demanding I give her back my college fund ($50 a month from grade 5) and move out (we live in a rural town with high cost of living) then ghosting me for a week (we live in the same house) My dad later supported me having a gap year after hearing my mums reaction As soon as she started to talk to me again he immediately flipped and went back to demnading I go In the end he booked my flights to go to uni after Id already accepted a full time contract at work with the only compromise being I didnt have to do 4 subjects in my first semester which really meant that he forced me to drop my only elective and the only subject I liked (physics mostly quantum and nuclear) Afterwards I burnt out and became a serious alcoholic and thats where I am now Its been well over a year and Im still here,Otto_von_Bismark2024,16192722750,2

gvr92f8,mxf4dl,The thing about having children is eventually if youre lucky you get so old that you become as vulnerable as a small child Too weak to maintain good hygiene at the very least Whos looking after your money? Whos there to drive you around to doctors appointments? Who will soothe your crushing loneliness after everyone your age has died?

gvs0r1r,mxf4dl,I was always the toxic one I was raised in a home with more than enough money and very loving parents but we never managed to get along I have a diagnosed autism spectrum disorder and Im also diagnosed ASPD so between those two things I dont have much compassion or empathy in me Think of someone who believes the ends justify the means but to the extreme I remember telling my (somewhat religious) parents that I didnt believe in god for the first time when I was like three Apparently thats not all too common amongst kids that age being raised with religion Right before I started kindergarten I sat both of my parents down and explained that for the rest of my childhood putting hands on me in any capacity would lead to an immediate call to DCF despite the fact my parents had never done or even threatened to do such a thing By the time I was in junior high I pretty much ran my household My parents always requested my respect but never once demanded it and I viewed that as an exploitable weakness I remember once my mom shattered a couple of my bongs when I was a teenager because Id gotten in trouble at school I took the cost of said bongs out of her purse walked right up to her and explained that I had taken money from her to cover the cost of the glass shed broken Her response was to cry and ask "why are you like this?" I didnt actually answer but the obvious response was "because I know I can be" Im now an adult and my parents still pay for any and everything I demand Theyve tried multiple times to initiate conversations in which they explain that they do this because theyre afraid not to sometimes I wonder how they havent figured out by this point that I dont care why they do it as long as its done I promise Im not here just to jerk myself off though Im getting to my point My point is that had my parents been a bit more like some of these "toxic" parents yall are bitching about I may not have learned respect but I definitely wouldve learned an appropriate level of fear for your parents/guardians Autistic sociopath or not I was a kid Had I gotten the shit kicked out of me or had my parents taken me down a peg verbally when I went full Scarface theres a genuine chance that the world would have one less narcissistic manipulative sociopath in it because diagnosis or not that shit is learned and I learned from a very young age that I could do whatever I wanted at home and face no legitimate consequences My parents inaction had a HUGE impact on who I am now Some people need to think about what kinda people they turned out to be before automatically accusing their parents of raising them wrong,RapeIncelsToDeathh,16193182500,2

gw568r6,mxf4dl,Criticizing their physical appearance during their formative years I had big buck teeth growing up and my mom always made snide comments about it I had braces got them off at 14 had retainers thought my teeth looked decent Around 16 my retainers didnt fit anymore (surprise your head and mouth can significantly change shape as you grow up) My mom refused to take me back to an orthodontist because shed "spent enough money on it" I was like whatever Im probably fine by now Over the next few years my teeth flared out because of the orientation of my jaw and the way I chew (something I found out years later after taking myself back to an orthodontist) Nearly every time I visited my family my mom would make some passive aggressive comment about it always in the presence of other people One thanksgiving she did it again and my grandma was drunk and screamed at her to shut up and blurted out that my mom had gingivitis and had a full set of dentures since she was in her 20s because of had oral hygiene The room went silent and my grandma just started drunkenly cackling Later in life I went back to an orthodontist and got everything fixed in under a year with Invisalign I now understand what my mom was doing was PROJECTING lol I just wish my grandma had said something sooner,realpenguinyolo,16195900250,2
gwv8b5e,mxf4dl,Gaslighting This is just one example of MANY: My mother did this CONSTANTLY and it got to the point where I was convinced I was absolutely worthless She "found" me a job at age 14 talking a local business owner into hiring me Luckily for me quickly saw through my mother and her games He made sure that my job became my "safe" space because I sure as hell didnt have it at home (or school but thats a different story) I didnt have access to my own bank account my mother did and she "had" to be the one to deposit my earnings for me because I wasnt 18 Well somehow it came up like more than a year in when my boss asked why I didnt get something new (I cant even remember what "it" was) My answer was that I didnt have any money Whatever that "it" was I had asked my mom for the money from my account to buy "it" and she said I didnt have enough to cover the cost She might have said it was tied up in a CD or something but whatever she said I didnt know any better and shed convinced me that I "couldnt possibly understand banking" because I was "so terrible at math" I was bad at math but not because I was stupid it was because I am dyslexic with numbers (something I wouldnt learn until AFTER I graduated high school) At any rate she told me so often that I was stupid and horrible at math and I believed her And when I told my boss this he didnt say anything After that every once in awhile hed ask if Id gotten something that I needed for school and of course I never had any money so my answer was always a "no" (notebooks pens something for a project) The boss got curious but said nothing - after all he paid me he knew what I should have saved and it should have been many times over what Id need for whatever the latest "it" was I never saw an account balance and I never actually cashed one of my checks - my mother did all that because I "was too stupid and wouldnt understand how banking works" and I couldnt do the math" so shed just handle it for me A few months later my mother stopped by with some friends and she made some comment that my boss overheard that made him suspect that she was spending my earnings Well he waited until she was out of town on vacation (a few months later) and he took me to the bank to get a statement Yup dear old mom had been using my earnings as her slush fund I honestly have no idea how my boss figured it out but he did and god love him forever for convincing me to get her name off my account I was able to get the paperwork to remove her from my account get my dads name put on it and get it all done before she got home (under 18 you had to have a parent on the account) There was holy hell to pay when she got home and found out I got the snot beat out of me for being "duplicitous" and removing her name from "our joint" account She even tried to force me to put her name back on but at that point it was too late I wasnt going to let her near it Thank god for that boss because if not for him Id still be in a dead-end low-paying job under my mothers thumb never getting a chance to go to college and in a deep financial hole of her making I just wish that Id gotten smarter about all her gaslighting much sooner,4NeverNever,16200996570,2

gxyxh6p,nbaar5,My dad and stepmoms wedding was a shit show For context her family was terrible on both sides (abusive father neglectful alcoholic mother and step parents who didnt care about her much) and she basically ran to my father to get away from it all when she was 15 Bigger problem was my dad was 26 also abusive and just a real fuckin shitshow of a person On my fathers side of things he hated his mother and blamed everything wrong in his life on her (as he did to most women in his family later doing it to my stepmom) So the wedding was doomed to be terrible It started when my stepmom was walking down the aisle Shed reconnected with her father in the last year and had recently been in a fight with her stepfather so it was just her dad walking Her There was a branch in the way (outdoor wedding) but he pulled it out if the way for her As she thanks him he lets go and flings it back into her face and literally collapses laughing She awkwardly chuckles no doubt knowing he is going to get mad at her if she shows shes upset and the day continues but shes visibly upset After the toasts some people didnt drink the champagne that had been set out The one thing she had asked of her mom was that she not drink -- she was even given sparkling juice rather than champagne So while stepmom is changing into her reception dress her mom goes table to table pounding down all of the alcohol she can get her hands on A cousin of mine who doesnt know whats happening starts chanting "Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!" and stepmom walks back to her mom downing the last one and denying everything Cousin slips out the tent once he realizes whats going on and leaves the two alone to argue Stepmom comes out crying a few minutes later goes back to her car and doesnt come back for a good 20 minutes While all of that is happening grandma pulls up and starts cursing out my dad for a ton of shit including marrying a kid (stepmom was 25 at this point) who she hates not letting her invite a friend to the wedding and him owing her a bunch of money Dad tells her to fuck off and she leaves Then my dad got mad at my stepmom for being gone so long accused her of either "being a baby" for crying or of lying and cheating on him So she sat down on the fringes and tried to not cry and also remain visible to my dad for the next several hours They may have been dating for 10 years but the marriage only lasted 6 months,GayHotAndDisabled,16209086750,2005
gxyuqqi,nbaar5,Very beautiful wedding in a huge barn at this apple orchard They must have spent a ton of money on the decorations and catering because it looked like something out of a magazine The ceremony was great the flower girl did her thing the vows got everyone choked up Everything seemed to be going well Not even 15 minutes into the reception the mothers of the bride and groom getting into a full out brawl hair pulling red wine being thrown Their sons jump in to defend their honor chairs start being throw tables are flipped parents are grabbing children and running for their lives The bride and groom are horrified and leave immediately and head back their honeymoon suite My fianc and I left after this as well but we herd from some other friends that most people ended up staying and getting wasted at the open bar on the bride and grooms dime Apparently the fight started because one of the grooms sister complemented the brides grandmothers dress The brides mom though she was being sarcastic and called her a bitch then the drama ensued Mind you they had all been pregaming the wedding pretty hard,AdmiralWackbar,16209069940,376

gxyy16f,nbaar5,I worked on a tropical island off the coast of Queensland Australia Loads of weddings happened there Most days thered be one or two One day this grooms party comes through my bar Theyre on the bucks party thing before the wedding the next day Theyre pretty drunk at 4pm I figured they started early and would finish early given they have a sunrise ceremony (worst idea in the world FYI) About an hour later theyve left and gone to another bar on the island Then the brides party comes through Equally shit faced I finished work at 9pm then came back 3 hours later to work in the night club I get in at midnight Start pouring drinks Its busy as fuck with like 250 people in the club Around 1am the groom and bride parties roll in absolutely destroyed They look disgustingly drunk Ive no idea why security let them in because I wasnt serving them They left about 45 minutes later So roughly theyd arrive back at their hotel rooms around 2am with the expectation that the bride and her party need to be up at 4am for hair and makeup to be done in time for a 715am ceremony They all decide "well just stay up all night and keep drinking until the wedding!" At this stage they had to have been drinking for 15-18 hours Anyway ceremony time rolls around She cant walk down the aisle which is on the beach in her heels so she tosses them off Groom and all their friends are drunk as fuck and can barely stand They try to say their ~~vowels~~ vows but the celebrant cant understand them so she isnt leagally allowed to marry them because theyre too drunk to consent to marriage Whole wedding is canned A simple wedding like the one they had for the wedding party and 20 guests cost $35000 So they wasted all that money to be told "sorry youre drunk I cannot legally marry you" Edit Being that quite a few people have said "this sounds like a fun way to spend your wedding So what if you didnt get legally married Just have the reception and sort it out later" They did have the reception From what I was told the bride passed out about an hour in The groom threw up everywhere The mothers of the bride and groom were hysterically crying and incredibly upset with their kids But for the guests who werent that wasted or crying they had a great time,YoungPatrickBateman,16209090030,8381

gxyvbb8,nbaar5,So my sister had her budget at a place that had one massive event room and a divider to make two separate smaller event rooms The wedding wasnt massive so they chose to split the room to save money The dividing wall was great It was decorated the same way as the rest of the room and was soundproof so we didnt really hear the other party unless you were practically pressing your ear against the wall It was an accordion wall (may be important) These rooms shared a lobby but had two separate entrances to the rooms so we didnt really see the other party After a while of having fun we hear some rumbling Not uncommon were less than a mile from an Air Force base Then it happened A group of about 5-10 people literally fell THROUGH the dividing wall Took part of the runners down broke panels etc No clue what happened but all of a sudden there were a ton of Indians dressed to the 9s and looking like the shiniest rainbow Ive ever seen tumble into my classic American white sisters princess wedding Ambulances came we assume everyone is okay but arent sure They fell into the head table and broke it But we were done eating and nobody was really there I think a bridesmaid lost a few accessories and a groomsman had his tux jacket damaged but not seriously I went to another event there a few months later and you couldnt even tell it happened,catmom6353,16209073570,62
gxys82i,nbaar5,I actually ruined my mothers best friends wedding when I was a kid At the reception I was outside playing with the other kids while the adults had fun Me being overly confident and trying to show off decided to dial 911 on the pay phone in the lobby of venue Thinking that as long as I didnt put any money in nothing would happen Moments later my youthful confidence left me with a cold sweat when a voice answered The other kids quickly stopped thinking I was cool when they saw the panic on my face I immediately hung up in hopes nothing else would happen After that I had about 15 minutes of anxious hoping that no one would tell on me Unfortunately a dropped 911 call from a six year old seemed suspicious enough that half the police department showed up and stopped the party After some confusion and questioning I was quickly found out I think my mom was torn between laughing at me and mortified that her kid was the cause Still makes me cringe to think about and Im 34,tqhp1,16209053080,342
gy0bif4,nbaar5,The wedding wasnt really ruined but it was a little heart breaking honestly One of my very close friends and former roommate from college got married recently He and I have been super close since we met as freshman His wife is a peach and her family is amazing The wedding was scheduled for unfortunately right in the start of the pandemic and was pushed off for several months Due to my financial situation i lost my job early last year and told him I wasnt going to be able to attend unfortunately He was okay with it I told him Id send a gift and all that jazz Well maybe a month before the rescheduled date his fiance calls me up (Id only spoken to her in short blips when he and I were gawking via discord chat) and basically BEGS me to come She says that if money as an issue all Id have to do was find something to wear and get to an airport Her family would house me and my (now ex) bf theyd make sure we got food and even pay for a plane ticket tk get there Apparently my friend didnt have ANYONE coming that wasnt in the wedding party I knew he had a rough life growing up and his mother was emotionally abusive and his dad was never in the picture But I had no idea it was so bad I told her not to worry and that Id be there I managed to scrape together enough money for a cheap hotel and gas to get to and from and we showed up myself my bf and his aunt and 2 of his coworkers were his only guests in a wedding planned for 200 people The best man couldnt make it (he lives over seas) so our other friend was promoted to best man and one other friend was in the wedding party The 3 of us friends made sure he had the best time while we were visiting And Ill never forget the genuine weeping happiness in his eyes when he saw his aunt showed up as a surprise,Midiblye,16209309440,52
gxyy7bo,nbaar5,In my country weddings go for 2 days Its about my cousins wedding I couldnt attend it as of really short notice The groom had cancer they planned to get married for years but always had to postpone it due to his health Finally he was much better so they planned the wedding Music was so horrible that nobody was dancing The band was the worst of the worst People tried but really it was a nightmare On the second day when the band was setting up guests told them to not bother After some time band left guest pulled out laptop and had a blast Unfortunately groom died 2 months later Other cousin was with her partner for years They had to postpone the wedding a year cause my grandfather died a month before Wedding was a blast After that they went on the one week honeymoon My cousin came back with divorce papers Her new husband had a girlfriend for years who was pregnant He stole all of the money from the wedding and ran away He was cooperating with other guy who was a boyfriend of my other cousin at that time They both had other girlfriends and were covering each other,LunarDamage,16209091020,106
gxyoe8o,nbaar5,So embarrassingly enough I was dating this girl who asked me to go to her exs wedding We dated for a handful months prior and asking me to go to a wedding together felt like a serious commitment So i accepted Planned for the week off work and we went all out for this wedding Half the time we were trying to enjoy our stay together she was missing Fast forward reception comes up she makes a scene in the most utterly unstable mentally sick way infront of children The groom the bride absolutely every one and says out loud " im still in love with you We literally have been fucking for the past two days since weve seen each other" She quickly gets escorted out The bride is clearly upset and everyone goes about their business But as soon as i leave this women that i fly 2 and half hours with starts ruining the hall and everything Getting so upset On her way out It was so embarrassing I figured she was telling the truth since she was missing the whole time and im pretty sure that everyone during the whole thingassumed this was too crazy to be real It felt so weird and awkward I felt alot of my time was wasted Felt more frustration than i could imagine But by the time i left I was able to leave early i felt a heavy burden being lifted Definately regret not seeing her mentality before but when you work so much and try to date at the same time you have very little time to get to know some people Time sorta flies by and you end up dating for a few months Fast forward a month or two later She got together with the groom and im pretty sure she has no regrets about wasting my time She probably doesnt even feel bad about using me or even Ruining that mans marriage This woman is seriously twisted Edit: well shit Didnt expect this many comments Thanks for the award! Concerning the "going to an exs wedding" there wernt any clear signs of dysfunctionality She was a rn that literally made more money then me and felt like she was just out of my league She had alot of paitence with me and being young adults hitting our 30s it felt like an fairly healthy relationship of two adults So seeing someone who was willing to see their exs happiness was a sign of a healthy relationship with her peers in my eyes Obviously im not going to defend her actions And being a mentally unhealthy human being that i am i just checked her fb just now and yes They are still together and yes they look like two people who just eloped,khaingo,16209024330,2370

gxzco4b,nbaar5,Omg oh no Ok so I get a wedding invitation out of the blue for an old college friend I go Its in Texas Creepy Texas Like dont go there if you dont know somebody there Texas I rent a truck and drive 2 hours from Dallas I get to the wedding and its in a "community center" Well this community center is basically a shack attached to a gas station Behind this gas station is a big metal scrap pile with a big dog on a chain guarding it So I get there and I find out that the brides family doesnt want the wedding to happen Why? Because her in laws are creepy Christians think creepy cult-like and they dont think the family treats her well They think her in laws are using her for money and brainwashed her Ok so whatever the wedding happens During the ceremony the brides uncle says "fuck this" loudly and walks away from the wedding Ok that was uncalled for but let me tell you I totally agree with him So the very second that the priest guy dismissed the wedding party and completes the wedding the groomsmen walk the bridesmaids back down the aisle When they get there they wait for the groom to get there with him When he does all the men take off after said uncle and all 5 of them just fight him The groom sucker punches him in the back of the head and the other 4 dogpile him Mind you this is a tiny frail old man who got sucker punched So the brides family is like "fuck that shit" and then the whole two sets of families start literally fighting while the bride is sitting in her truck sobbing I go talk to the bride I offer to buy her a plane ticket to leave with me I offer to drive her around and get away for a bit THEN HER HUSBAND COMES IVER TO ME AND TELLS ME THAT HIS WIFE AND I DONT HAVE PERMISSION TO TALK TO HER So I get in it with him I told him I was recording the whole thing and that I have proof that he and his boys sucker punched an old man and that if he lays a damned finger on me or her that I will put him face down on the ground in order to keep my friend safe THEN MY FRIEND YELLS AT ME FOR DEFENDING HER!! she starts saying really creepy stuff like how hes her husband and she MUST obey him or she is disobeying god Save to say I got the fuck outta dodge and I cannot abide anything to do with Texas after that I left went back to Dallas had me some phenomenal local Mexican food saw the jfk memorial and then left Texas forever,amaresnape,16209162460,33
gxz97yw,nbaar5,My brothers wedding was a complete disaster but they pretty much ruined it themselves They dont even like being around each other but they both wanted to get married to whoever would take them so there they were Heres a list of what went wrong: * Wedding was outdoors in October in an open field with no electricity water or bathrooms * Two tiny RVs were brought in to serve as bathrooms/changing rooms for 150+ guests for seven hours * Brides grandmother (A rather rotund woman) got stuck in the door to one of the RVs Groomsmen had to pry her out * Mother of the groom (My mom) was instructed to make four cakes for the wedding so that the couple could save money All are delivered and then left out on a table in the sun for several hours sticking them to inside of their boxes and making a mess * First look photos were a disaster as the grooms reaction wasnt enough for the bride and she was visibly angry about it * The ceremony starts and the bride doesnt want to go through with it suddenly Bridesmaids have to convince her that its just nerves she nearly pukes on her way to the aisle * When its time for the bride to come down the aisle groom pulls out a guitar and begins singing a break up song to her as she walks down Lyrics are not subtle * After the ceremony bride refuses to walk back up the aisle next to the groom he is instead told to follow behind her and carry her train and veil She still seems angry * Bride and groom split off at the reception and refuse to look at each other eat together or even acknowledge that this is their wedding They have to be forced back together when its time to cut the cake or take photos At one point the groom is found a mile away in a neighboring field * The catering team hadnt expected to be without power so all the food is cold * First dance goes poorly as the bride and groom are basically just holding on to each other and swaying slightly in place Their song of choice was "Flightless Bird American Mouth" from Twilight * Majority of guests file out after this including me and my husband Judging by the photos it looks like everyone but the wedding party left and then they obviously staged a lot of "drunken party" style pics to make it look like they had a good time after everyone left They didnt,IamGhosty,16209146880,26

To which my brother responds "I guess we get fucked up" they dont even walk down the isle just start moving chairs to make room for the dance floor The bride has her dance with her dad and my brother Hasnt even said hello to my mother and I My brother had to be reminded that he needed to dance with my mom which the bride cuts in half way through Then we have to get pictures and the bride still wont talk to us She only lets us get a few then spends an hour with my brother taking pictures with her family The reception was supposed to go until 11 Two hours into the reception at about 7 the bride got on the microphone to send everyone home because shes tired It felt like a pretend wedding I wasnt surprised when they started talking about divorce a few months later Im not even sure they made it to their first year The wedding was a mess,millennial_milkshake,16209928450,24

I got replies like "we are never getting back together" and frankly most of T-Swifts catalogue instead I just played jazz and daft punk seemed to fit somehow There was a complete 6 piece Katy Perry cover band that was a surprise to the bride they just packed up and left without playing anything No there wasnt a dance party Can you imagine?

gxzjvkh,nbaar5,Way late to the party but gotta add this wonderful example of redneck glory from June 1998 Bride was one one of those Keeping Up With The Joneses types saw herself as a real life Princess that deserves everything handed to her on silver platter Shes drop dead gorgeous and knows it If you didnt know her family history youd think she was born into old money But she grew up in a trailer park parents are 2nd cousins but due to rampant infidelity her real father might be her dads brother or maybe even her dads estranged father who is 1st cousins with grooms mother She has 7 siblings and all but one of their paternity is in question as well Grooms family is much the same but he only has 5 siblings all brothers but the groom is smart as a whip and very business savvy so he escaped the poverty via education and hard work in finance and took the bride along for the ride despite her never working a day in her life The wedding was a $50k affair the brides ring was a $20k stunner and she was already upset because the groom who was paying for the entire wedding was being cheap The rather large guest list included their "new life" social circle grooms college social circle grooms business associates and clients and both bride & groom parents which was the end of family members on the guest list Some 300 guests and only 4 of them family members and the wedding was an hour drive from the town where they both grew up A whole 10 minutes into the ceremony a huge police task force raids the wedding to serve a little over a dozen outstanding arrest warrants of family members but the big bust was a big bust because the bride & groom intentionally left their extended families off the guest list but the local and state police had anticipated that extended family being invited and in attendance Really embarrassing but ultimately a fairly short interruption all things considered Wedding proceeds and if not for the wise decision to exclude siblings and extended family the wedding would have been an unmitigated multi-front disaster Good thing a large group of trailer trash rednecks many of whom are career criminals with zero respect for the law arent at all offended by the exclusion and will totally honor bride & grooms wishes for them to not be there on Princesss special big day An hour into the open bar reception the party had slowly grown in size by nearly 100 people who very much seemed out of place Dressed in everything from tacky thrift store suits & dresses to camo pants & cut off sleeveless camo shirts to biker leathers and everything in between the new arrivals that trickled in were quite loud and obnoxious This was the crowd the police had been expecting at the wedding and it was now very obvious to the invited guests why the police had shown up I suspect the police were first called the moment the Best Mans unconscious body hit the floor and another groomsman was thrown onto the chocolate fountain but it took a solid 10 minutes before the first cop showed up and another 5 before that original task force made an appearance By then the reception had turned into a Hollywood-style bar brawl mostly the bride and grooms family fighting -- each other By the time the police task force had shown up most of the invited guests had bailed as that kind of thing was just not in their wheelhouse The cops had a hell of a time ending the chaos but they did get 9 of their targets one of whom was wanted for murder though he *was* later found innocent All in all some 25 people were arrested about 10 of them women and there has $15k in damages to the building including broken windows and a small fire Source: Was the +1 of a bridesmaid She ended up with a split lip and had one of the punch bowls dumped on her and the bride Last I heard the bride & groom were still happily married at their 20th anniversary a few years ago They have a single child a well adjusted daughter born a couple years after the wedding,BoneHugsHominy,16209193790,14

The bride and groom then want to stop at local bars so the bride can show off her dress (that she had to get a second job to afford) At the first bar one of the bridesmaids got into a fight with her boyfriend and spent the rest the time crying in the bathroom We continue to be paraded through different bars for 3 or more hours Every bar we went into people were buying shots for the bride and groom By the time we actually were headed back to the reception we were 2 hours late and the bride and groom were really drunk The reception was held in a really old hotel not in the greatest area of town and was pretty run down More guests showed up than were invited People were getting antsy waiting for the wedding party to show up so they started serving dinner The wedding was on a budget so the brides family prepared all the food and there was just enough for the invited guests By the time the wedding party arrived the food was gone The wedding party was only able to eat some salad and cake The venues air conditioning didnt work well and the frosting on the cake melted The bride was too drunk and passed out so the couple didnt have their first dance They brides family still wanted to do the bouquet toss and was going to have the brides matron of honor (her cousin) do it When the time came the MoH was MIA The brides family started to look for her and her husband found her in one of the hotel rooms with one of the wedding guests The husband and the guest got into a fight and the police were called and they both were arrested It turns out the MoH had been having an affair via Facebook and they were going to meet up at the hotel The kicker is the bride and groom invited family on their honeymoon and the MoH (the brides cousin) and her husband still went Apparently they fought the whole time about the affair When they got back they got divorced and about 2 years later the bride and groom each had their own separate affairs and are now divorced,LilSam618,16212696830,10
gxyxe2u,nbaar5,Wedding photographer here Did a wedding at a winery once bride and groom were tipsy before the ceremony even startedit all went downhill from there After the pictures (which was like wrangling retarded cats ) the drinking continued The bride had a meltdown when she saw her cake and demanded it be taken out of the room immediatelyscreaming obscenities the entire time Then during the garter toss the DJ told the groom he had to dance sexy for his wife so he proceeded to take ALL his clothes off on the dance floor and do a crazy dance Underwear only Grandma was horrified Then as more liquor flowed the DJ played a game where the bride was blindfolded and had to go down a line of men grabbing their junk to try and see if she could tell which one was her groom The wedding coordinator was having a fit family was so embarrassed and leaving in droves Then the groomsmen thought they were being funny so they brought a real ball and chain from the Middle Ages and clamped it on the grooms leg They claimed there was no key to unlock it He was so drunk and pissed off he left the wedding to get it cut off his leg and never returned The bride did the money dance by herself completely plastered and pissed off at her new husband When the drunken guests started throwing the wine glasses on the cement and breaking them for fun the coordinator finally shut the disaster down I have never seen a drunker situation I have to say they were both pretty embarrassed when they came to pick up their photos Its been a great story through the years so yeah just another day at the office,Thinkerandvaper,16209086250,54
gy0qi23,nbaar5,Ok so my girlfriend is currently reading these comments so shell either laugh her ass off or kill me for posting this but whatever thats a later problem This one hasnt technically happened yet but boy is it going to be good So her brother is getting married for the second time after finalizing his divorce from his ex-wife late last year His ex-wife is genuinely a horrible human being that tried to murder him by ramming his car with hers while their two kids were in it and then claimed she was being abused while beating the ever loving dogshit out of him I live in the South and the courts are less than friendly to men down here involved in things such as this so he has been utterly fucked in his divorce The absolute last thing he needs to do right now is get married So he met his wife to be while he was going through the divorce stuff and to her credit she kicked his ass to make sure he got it finalized because it genuinely was causing him a lot of stress But oh boy shes a trip herself She basically threatened to break up with him about 9 months into their relationship if he wasnt going to propose to her (meanwhile the ink hasnt even dried on the divorce papers yet) and so he basically gets bullied into proposing to her So thats great She is insanely obnoxious and trashy and is also constantly drunk or high 90% of the time and is incredibly controlling His wife to be is mixed (african american and hispanic) and my girlfriends family is from a very wealthy part of Connecticut and they DO NOT APPROVE of this AT ALL Their mom is kind of racist and said that "shes fine with them getting married as long as they dont have mixed babies" and the other brothers are starting a pool on whether or not it happens All good stuff So the details: \- Have been engaged since Thanksgiving \- Wedding is 5 months away and they still technically dont have a venue \- My girlfriend was originally going to be his best man since no one wants to do it \- Family got up in arms about it so now I am likely going to be the best man as a neutral "Switzerland" option \- Since they have no venue theyre likely going to have to do it at the Holiday Inn \- No other work has been done \- Wife to be is insanely controlling and a massive alcoholic \- Family is not at all enthusiastic about this \- She is forcing him to buy a house in an area "because of the schools" even though the school district she wants to live in sucks \- She doesnt have money to buy a house so he is going to be paying for all of it by cashing out his 401K of which the ex-wife still gets $7000 from This wedding if it happens is going to be an absolute shitshow Ill be happy to provide updates,TheAnalogKid18,16209370650,9
gy0v1zp,nbaar5,Not what OP asked for but I had an opposite experience I have a penchant for ruining family gatherings and have a deeply troubled relationship with most of my relatives for various reasons Mostly stemming from the fact that Im politically left and I dont give free-passes for people using racist language or joking at queer folks etc Anyway my brother and I have hated each other since birth We do not talk at all right now and havent in many years My mother keeps suffering under the delusion that its all temporary and someday well all be a happy family although were in our mid 30s now and it only gets worse every year lol About 6 years ago I got invited to his wedding and it was a nightmare for everyone except me I love weddings I love drinking I love dancing I love meeting new people and getting turnt You could tell my parents and some family members were scrutinizing me like crazy waiting for me to pop-off I made a promise to myself before I ever went there that I would smile the entire time I would be polite to everyone and have a great time no matter what I gave my brother a hug (Ive never done that and never did it since) and he froze with a look of disgust Did not hug me back Walked away after His wife and several of her friends would swing by me a few times during the night and try to get me to talk shit about him Theyd ask why I was never around and what went on between us and I just shrugged and smiled and said I had no idea what they were on about As the night went on my mother was bawling in the corner because my bro is a dick and ignored her the whole wedding with my grandmother drying her tears My brother had seated his whole family in the back corner and pretended he didnt notice us (He married into money and we arent rich so he was embarrassed) By the end the Wife was also bawling and vomitting everywhere the new inlaws were all Real Housewife types who only drank water but seemed to be higher than kites on their scrips It was hilarious The bridesmaids were all crying and fighting with each othter glasses were being thrown &#x200B; And there I was all by myself screaming for the DJ to drop the bass Everyone told me they were shocked I was so well-behaved But fuck that this was the one time in my life when I wasnt blamed for ruining everything and they did it all on their own,josiahpapaya,16209389840,9

gxzw5e8,nbaar5,My ownWhere to start? My mom did all the wedding planning and arrangements for my ex and I to get married in Las Vegas Hotel reservations chapel booked nail and hair appts reception dinner reservation flowers cake etc We handled our clothes travel and paid for hotel for ourselves His family refused to attend because it was Memorial Day weekend and they had plans for a family BBQ instead So our entire guest list was 6 2 of which were my stepsibs who were 5 and 3 at the time During the wedding planning my stepsibs mother (my stepdads ex wife) screamed on the phone and said that she would charge him with kidnapping if he took the kids out of state for the wedding unless he paid her an extra $1500 in support We get to Vegas and the hotel refuses to let us check in because we are both under 25 I have to call my mom to come down from her room to switch the room reservation to her name and give her cash to repay her When we go to the county clerk to get our license she initially refused to issue it because my exs legal birth name is technically a nickname (think "Nick Sid" on his BC instead of "Nicholas Sidney" - not his real name but you get the idea) Finally we got that but it makes me 5 minutes late for my hair and nail appt Get to the salon they claim theres no appt and its a 2 hour wait for service I step outside to call my mom for help since she made the appt and my purse got stolen with all my ID and travel money in it My dad went dumpster diving IN HIS USMC dress uniform and didnt find it While doing my own hair and makeup I cut my hand open on my "borrowed" piece of jewelry for the ceremony (still have the scar on my palm) Got to the chapel and they had lost the info on my prepaid wedding so I didnt get the upgrades we had paid for (like roses in my bouquet) The photographer that was part of the package was drunk as a skunk and only spoke German - so all my wedding photos are me in tears while Im being screamed commands in German how to be posed Of 3 rolls of film I only got one photo of the whole thing that came out halfway decent My mom told everyone the wrong time for the ceremony so what few guests we had showed up 45 minutes late - including my parents who were standing up with us and our witnesses The chapel was threatening to cancel our ceremony and make us rebook as my famly came running up late My uncle showed up in wrinkled chinos and shirt with dirty old tennies on and refused to take his sunglasses off the whole time even for photos My stepsibs fought through the whole ceremony including kicking each other and screaming in the chapel The vows which I had specifically told the chaplain were NOT to include the words "love honor and obey" for BOTH of us were still give to us as "love honor and obey" I got dirty looks from the chaplain when I said "love honor and cherish" but w/e My reception dinner - restaurant lost the reservation (are we seeing a trend here?) and apologized by hyping my stepsibs up with free soda until they were vibrating The wedding cake that was supposed to arrive after dinner didnt The restaurant kitchen swore they didnt receive the delivery Calls to the baker were met with "I delivered it to the kitchen myself what do you want from me?" We went back to my parents hotel room to chat and get a call that my cake has been located The baker had delivered it to the hotels ROOM SERVICE kitchen instead of the restaurant kitchen They sent my cake up but refused us any silver or plates unless we wanted to pay $10 a head for their use My cake which was supposed to be a small 2-tier round wedding cake was a half-sheet cake that looked exactly like a grocery store bakery birthday cake I cut my wedding cake with the handle of a plastic fork - which my mom had luckily packed disposable tableware in case the hotel refused to provide any My ex shoved cake in my face and up my nose despite our agreement not to do any cake shoving during the "first bite" In the process he pulled one of my earrings out of my ear and nearly tore my earlobe I ended locked in the bathroom with my mom and aunt while they iced my ear and helped me get frosting out of my ears nose and eyelashes Meanwhile my ex was thisclose to getting his ass beat in the other room by my stepdad and uncle while my stepsibs were jumping on the bed and trying to shove cake down their gullets before anyone stopped them In all this we forgot to ice the bottle of champagne that my mom had bought so my toast was with warm champagne My uncle threw a fit because I wasnt 21 yet and I told him after the day wed had if I wanted a sip of champagne on my wedding day that was my business He sulked for the rest of the night My hotel room for the wedding night was across the hall from my parents so after the "reception" we retreated over there to change and relax The AC was broken In the on position So its May in Las Vegas and its 62 degrees in our hotel room They cant send anyone up because theres no maintenance staff available to look at it We end up putting on pajamas and huddling under the blanket to stay warm while we watch Star Trek Meanwhile we can hear my aunt dying laughing in the hall over our DND sign on the door because we had clearly "started the honeymoon fast" My uncle bitched because we were "doing THAT" with my stepsibs and parents across the hall My stepsibs are so sugar high that Im pretty sure at least one of them discovered a new dimension and my mom started beating on my door telling me she is going to make me have the kids sleep in my room for the night so I can get first hand experience at what parenthood is like Luckily my stepad talked her off that ledge The next day we went to change hotels and once again prepaid reservation lost That was the ONLY thing that worked in my favor because upon hearing that the day manager upgraded us to a suite got us tickets to the concert in their theater (sadly we were too young to attend so she unlocked the CCTV of the concert to our room for free) and booked us a cabana at the pool But yeah disaster start to finish I think it was the Universe trying to warn me off of marrying him,geminiloveca,16209245780,5

gxzjmf6,nbaar5,It was me My wedding was ruined My wife is American and Im Indian Last year we traveled to India for our wedding which we had been planning for many a long time As is customary in India my parents paid for the whole thing I wasnt comfortable with them having anything to do with our honeymoon so I paid for that Everything else - renting the place catering invites for hundreds of guests multi-day ceremonies hotel all paid for by my parents from their savings We fly to India with some of her family - not cheap! Our close friends from the US and Canada also flew over at their own expense With a couple of weeks to go Modi went on TV and announced a nationwide lockdown - effective in 4 hours lolwut That meant no public events Cops were fining or arresting people simply for stepping out Heck even if we could somehow have had the wedding ceremony the catering flowers and others wouldnt have made it there Some of our friends had plans to fly back to the US right after the wedding They couldnt get out since flights had been canceled Their tickets werent refunded either My family could not indefinitely pay for hotel stays for our Indian guests from other cities and they couldnt leave and drive back Some of them couldnt continue to stay at the hotels and they snuck into my parents house (snuck in because of the lockdown) and stayed there for many days We took to sleeping on mattresses on the floor so that our guests could sleep in comfort Back then the loss of money was heartbreaking Thankfully my family is well-off but it was still an enormous expense We felt especially bad for friends and family who had flown across the world for this Some were stepping outside N America for the first time and couldnt even see some of India despite all the cost and time spent Looking back its a happy memory because its made for some very memorable stories We did have an incredibly modest (and fun) ceremony in my parents living room with flowers from their garden homecooked food and lots of banter Growing up in India you learn to take such jolts in your stride and see the humour in it My wifes family were extremely gracious despite their experience Well be having a "proper" wedding in the future but it will have to wait for a few years since weddings cost TONS more in America than they do in India and my parents wont be spending a penny on that one :) On another note - given the sacrifices that Indians made last year - especially since it was so personal for my family - we are incredibly incredibly angry at how callously restrictions were lifted earlier this year With all the death and mayhem going on because of the Modi administrations arrogance and hubris we feel like all our trials and sacrifices have been for nothing,cockraptor,16209192710,6

gy1q54b,nbaar5,My aunt and uncle were getting married while I was about 10 yrs old Everything was going smooth until the ring bearer didnt show up Somebody was supposed to bring the ring down the carpet but this man was nowhere Being an only child and being 10 I didnt think much of it We waited about 10-15 minutes and no one showed up Everyone was getting anxious but no one though to check where the ring bearer was supposed to come from And around the corner was a giant and I mean giant pool of blood with a ring box sitting in it The mans body was nowhere in plain sight but after the finding of this the cops were immediately called and it turns out The body was In a closet and the husband/groom was the top suspect Soon after he admitted to killing the man who was his sisters friends kid (i call him man cuz he was 14) he said he killed him when he told everyone he was taking a bp"bathroom break" and he admitted to stealing the ring to sell for money He was also in a gang and he had robbed nearly 25 houses and made a fortune off of selling things -grammer and stuff-,GalaxyLucas,16209545610,11
gyjxqut,nbaar5,My best friend (bride) selected her old roommate as a bridesmaid even though she was known for being extremely moody mean and narcissistic This bridesmaid insisted she make all 300 wedding invites by hand (because she was an avid scrap-booker) The bride agreed because she thought shed save money She didnt Everything this bridesmaid purchased was way over budget and difficult to source She couldnt make all the invites by hand on time as they were far too detailed She guilt tripped all the bridesmaids into making the invites with her which took days and shifts of volunteers She was horribly rude She tried to take over every event planned for the bride even though her sister and I outranked her in the bridal party and had it handled She made myself and the other bridesmaids want fo quit several times The bride ( I love her but) was extremely unorganised late to everything due to her total lack of time management and insisted on handing out tons of jobs in the week leading up to the wedding that should have been done well in advance to that It felt hard to breathe from the stress of it Even her 200 person seating chart wasnt done until 2am the night before the wedding Her friend from the church told her she changed her mind about how much she would charge for the dresses she was making all of us I think she tripled the cost Very last minute in terms of wedding planning So she gave that girl the boot Then she was having our dresses made by the Grooms aunt None of them fit right and we were having last minute fittings up until the day before the wedding The aunt turned up the morning of the wedding with the brides altered dress and it did not fit The bride was crying And it was not the finished look they had agreed on It ended up being a pretty boring gown And we were all trying to offer a solution while watching the start time of the wedding come and go on the clock We were an hour late to her wedding The guests were not amused You could feel the tension The service was one where the pastors goal was to convert any non-Christians and waffled on and on Boring Bible bashing The bride tried to save on photography by having her own aunt do the photos because she loved her aunts amateur wildlife photography Turns out photographing people was much harder for than she cared to admit and my friend still regrets her photos even 16 years later She cried when she got them back They were awful and the aunt had forgotten to take pictures of key family members too I gave my speech to the bride at the reception and had everyone in laughing when I finished by saying "Laura Im jealous that you will be having sex tonight and I wont" I knew the couple had waited until their wedding night to consummate and that my audience would be conservative Christian so they would be extraordinarily shocked and love it I could see my mother in the large crowd of tables stand up and take off to the bathroom My young sister informed me that mum was so embarrassed by me I found mum in the loo and she said "I am so embarrassed to call you my daughter right now I cant believe you would say that in front of 200 guests You know better" I laughed it off The wedding reception ended early when a guest had a seizure on the dance floor and had to be taken away by ambulance He was a known epileptic in the bridess church and he knew the consequences of being around flashing disco lights but he selfishly did it any way The bride was so upset as dancing is one of her favourite things in the world and what she and the groom were looking forward to most When it came to my own wedding a few months later we had a bit of a drive to an old country church I was on time because I learned a lot from her wedding But suddenly the car carrying the bridesmaids pulled over and so we followed When one of the bridesmaids came up to my car and told me she was told by my maid of honour (Laura) to stop the cars so we could be a little late so all the guests had time to take a seat I was more than annoyed I had already factored that into my time No way she was going to make me late to my wedding like she was to hers,Public-Shoulder-5552,16213343580,11

gxzfzog,nbaar5,It was my brother first wedding and I was the best man The wedding took place on Puerto Rico the couple did not had a lot to spend so I offered to cover the open bar I thought that I would just put the money for drinks and a bartender turns out the venue didnt allow the bartend to prep the bar and put the beers on the cooler We arrived after the reception to find the bar completely empty with the beers at room temperature level which in the Caribbean is at least 98F Some friends and I hustle prep the bar and Im sweating balls when its time for my speach I get up and and my speech completely bombs Mostly due to my brother then wife family being overly religious and I doing my speech around the party alcohol and my brother not so godly ways before meeting her If this wasnt enough the venue didnt offer security Around 15 cars had their windows smashed and contents stolen including my Mom and then girlfriend car Had to help repay for moms and girlfriend window plus the ex gf purse was there with her prescription glasses and wallet with over $500 cash I promised myself to only be a guest at wedding from that point on,IWUVTITTIES69,16209176940,3
gxzgqon,nbaar5,I was the Best man for one of my childhood best friends He spent a pile of money on this wedding All the groomsmen and bridesmaids showed up early to set up and get the typical before hand pictures Nothing seemed out of the ordinary The actual ceremony started at 3pm 2:55 rolls around and I have a good buzz going on and I am just helping the guests to their seat Thats when I seen the Pastor making his way through the crowd B lining it towards me The Pastor grabs me by the arm and says "Come with me we need your help now You may want to grab another drink for this one" I go inside and notice the maid of honor balling her eyes out The pastor explains to me that the Bride to be drove off after getting a phone call from a guy she has been cheating on the groom with begging her not to get married So apparently she a took off in her car and left wedding dress and all By this point im half drunk and half shitting a brick I had to go to the front of the ceremony and tell everyone that there wasnt going to be a wedding Then I had to go and console the Groom because he was very distraught and couldnt believe what just happened,HotRevolvers,16209180200,3
gxzh16x,nbaar5,I was the DJ for a wedding years ago which had so many crazy things happen I wrote them all down for posterity 1) They requested I play polka for the first hour and a half Everyone danced for the first song then the dance floor cleared I asked if they wanted to change it up and they told me to keep the polka going 2) The polka ends people are dancing and a very drunk mother of the groom asks me to play more polka 3) The groomsmen stole the grooms pants tied a knot in the bottom of each leg and went around asking people to fill the pants with money insisting they would not give his pants back until they were full 4) The groom was understandably staying in the bathroom a group of guys pulled him out forcing him to walk around in his underwear He ended up hanging out behind my DJ table for a while 5) A group of guys pulled up in a truck and started yelling insults at some guests standing outside The mother of the groom runs after them falls and breaks her collar bone The ambulance comes and takes her to the hospital and the groom goes with her,surflessbum,16209181480,3

We spent the entire reception taking pictures and the people serving food served the food too soon so by the time we got done taking all of the pictures My new bride and I didnt get any food and the majority of the people had pretty much left We didnt get to dance we had no "party" my wife and I got a drink a piece and by the time we were ready to dance no one was there So we ended up changing cleaning up after everyone and then going out to dinner Dealing with all of this while I had a twisted ankle that was swollen up to the size of a grapefruit Also someone walked off with all of our expensive catered left overs leaving us with nothing!

gxzpje2,nbaar5,This is India Lucknow hot summer day 300 people gathered in an open lawn and at 7ish pm when the bride showed up people gathered and were celebrating and feasting The venue was a good 2 miles from the hotel and when I got there we went straight to the dessert stand It was in a lush green lawn and with music and open tents with lighting Uttar Pradesh with its 200m people and a state where it matters how one marries to maybe differentiate between classes and this was definitely a rich affair While having a nice chocolate sundae I heard a noise it was thunder in the background it was louder than the loud music and the cloud seemed to be moving in our direction In less than half an hour it started to drizzle there was a sense of tension in everyones eye especially the organisers who had probably spent a good $100k that evening The lighting company started frantically covering up their wiring and sparks were emitting from some of the focus lights The tent fabric was now wet and now the beams started to make some god awful noises And while this was going guests covering their bright dresses and bleeding makeup rn towards shelter or their cars As people started to leave my friend who was getting married mostly drenched in sweat and rain tried to keep guests from leaving but in vain I was drenched but made a dash to the dessert counter for that 3rd scoop of ice-cream before all that food for 300 people would have been packed up Then the unthinkable happened well not unthinkable as the tent was holding 100s of litres of water finnally gave way and collapsed Hitting a man who probably didnt break a bone but was definitely bleeding We left the venue to get a cab and with mud on our shoes got to the hotel After reaching the designated party room we cracked open a beer and waited while other guests got back One token gift for the lucky couple got wet and electronics and water dont get along so we joked over that Finally our friend came by our room since then I had made a few trips to the lobby helping his very troubled dad to arrange for food for the guests at their rooms and make sure others guests got cabs For obvious reasons the night ended without the after party This was an arranged marriage where the couple arent in love but their families meet up and set them up In this setting people care more about caste money made and how the girl looks Fast forward 4 days later at my friends place he mentioned that after they eventually got married and went for their honeymoon for a week well confused I said but its been 4 days He was like his wife and him had a fight she accused him of trying to kiss her She never liked him married for money I didnt say much gave him a beer and later updated his Tinder for him he is too shy to actually say much He is a sweet guy lemme know if one of you ladies is single,kadan5,16209217800,3
gxzqjpm,nbaar5,They did not plan *at all* so the wedding party (I was a bridesmaid) and family were forced to pretty much pull everything together the day before I was literally painting the brides signs (which couldve been done well beforehand) Im married had a pretty large wedding and cant fathom why the bride and groom waited until the last minute to plan Their venue was gorgeous and you could tell the family put a lot of money into it They also made it a "pot luck" dinner and absolutely no one brought any food To be fair we were already expected to provide alcohol and pay for our own rooms and transportation so I dont think anyone was inclined to add an entire dish to feed a whole wedding on top of the other expenses So on top of all the physical labor a lot of us had to do the night before they didnt even bother to provide any kind of food so everyone was extremely grumpy Me and a few other bridesmaids secretly bought pizzas and ate them in the car I wouldve shared but honestly Im not gonna spend my own money to feed an entire wedding party and family Thats just ridiculous Honestly I still had fun and the only thing that really bothered me was the fact that we spent a whole hour in the December cold taking photos of the bride/groom and wedding party I *never once* saw any of those photos,CrackPipeQueen,16209222120,3

gxzwbqu,nbaar5,I wouldnt say it ruined the wedding but one of the saddest things I ever saw I was very good friends with a guy Tom He was rather guarded about his past and growing up Over time I learned that his Mother had walked out on the family and he had no idea where she was or even if she was alive His Father remarried a woman and she wasnt very nice to him and his sister His Father often traveled for work and he said "as soon as his truck went around the corner step mom was in her car and gone and we wouldnt see her until hours before he got back" Him and his sister pretty much raised themselves Over time I figured out his Dad was an alcoholic I will say I never met the guy Tom got engaged to a very nice woman and I was really happy for him They planned out all the wedding One day Tom came in all excited and said his Father was flying in for the wedding Day before the wedding Tom and I went to the airport to wait for his Dad Tom told me one of the reasons his Dad was coming was because he had sent his Dad the money for the plane ticket We waited at the exit and I watched the arrival board Wasnt that big of place and only 3 planes came in around that time Each arrived and his Father never showed We even stood there after all planes were in and the bags were off the carousel Tom was on the verge of tears I asked if he wanted to go to customer service and check to see if Dad got delayed some place Tom couldnt even speak just shook his head no Tom never said a word on the way home He never said a thing about it the rest of the time I knew him,Danmont88,16209246520,3
gxzy7x9,nbaar5,One of my conservative friends got married at one of their relatives house to save money Which was a great idea! The issue was that the conservative families of the bride and groom just assume that anyone that drinks is irresponsible and assumed we were going to go full-on animal house cause we had more than one bud-light Besides getting dirty looks every time we went to get drinks the real issue came at the end of the night They shuttled us all to the wedding and said there would be a shuttle back at the end of the night There wasnt So at the end of the night as we are all standing by the road trying to book an Uber after finding out there is no shuttle the relatives of the bride and groom come out and start screaming at us Yelling things like how we are irresponsible and going to get everyone in trouble for drinking and driving Obviously we were not trying to drive and even if we were going to drive WE DIDNT HAVE A CAR THERE CAUSE THEY SHUTTLED US They were freaking out and not understanding anything we were saying (my guess is they drank too much and werent used to drinking) They were taking our phones so we couldnt even call an Uber We were like lady "wtf are you doing?!" After about an hour of them shaming us one of the relatives called some special shuttle service that brought one car for the 15 or so of usso we were all forced to illegally jam in the back of this 6-person car We were just trying to be responsible and call and Uberno one has spoke to the groom or bride about it since Really ruined the wedding for us,TeaBeerSeltzer,16209254580,3
gy041oc,nbaar5,Does it count if the wedding technically didnt happen? Wedding was late no one knew why then they figured out the groom Wasnt there Seems peculiar More probing we find out hes actually in jail and theyre trying to get somsome to post his bond (bail? Idk the difference) he got a DUI driving home from his bachelor party the night before I guess they werent gonna get him there in time so they called it and just told people to go to the reception Well thats when an unknown baby mama showed up to start shit with him and have him "claim his child" Issue was he wasnt there just the bride in her dress crying while this woman yells for the groom The men who knew her got her out of the reception Bride had a first dance and everything not with the groom but with my uncle The groom never showed up and everyone sort of just acted like it was nothing and carried on Since I love drama I went around talking to ppl who I knew would know the full story So this couple is on wedding number 4 They tried to get married at the court house he had to "work" and never showed up They tried again at the courthouse he owed the gov money and had to deal with that rather than get married Tried again more traditional another drunk tank situation but this time with a groomsmen I think this being a repeat offense just makes it worse Hes clearly not trying to get married Move on lol,mongoosedog12,16209278890,3
gy0rhip,nbaar5,I worked at a library that used to be rented out for weddings and Id make extra money by running the coat check and helping out with the event setup/breakdown Anyway one wedding the catering company set up the chafing trays too close to the fire alarm Not only did the alarm go off but the sprinkler system was triggered and destroyed the food The usual maintenance guy wasnt there that night so the assistant had to try to shut down the sprinkler system - which he didnt know how to do While he was trying to get the head maintenance guy on the phone the fire department showed up Meanwhile we were frantically trying to keep the water from the sprinkler system from flooding the ballroom where the reception was happening so things wouldnt get worse The fire department was able to help turn off the sprinklers but all the food was completely ruined The bride and groom were pretty understanding; I believe we comped the venue fee and they ended up ordering a ton of Thai food for the guests,Tauber10,16209374640,3

gy07j1m,nbaar5,I finally have a story to share Buckle tf up So my cousins best friend is getting married Ex best friend now Shes also a family friend so my entire family is invited The bride (lets call her Felicia) goes all out 20k on the venue in Newport 5k on the dress Felicia went off! At the bridal shower (which was thrown at my uncles house) she was saying how she was a little short & people pitched in to help her pay Fast forward to the day of the wedding We arrive half an hr late & all the guests are standing in the parking lot Weird but we pregame so we think nothing of it An hr later the caterers start feeling bad so the let us into the foyer (it had a foyer!!) where they passed out hors doeuvres At this point rumors start flying Groom didnt show Bride is nowhere to be found Felicia is upstairs crying with her bridesmaids (my cousins) The caterers are informed the Wedding is off so they take us to the reception area The bride enters to Survivor by Destinys Child & is flooded with love and support At this point Im faded She paid for an open bar so I woke up at my cousins house by a lady in a wedding dress banging on the bathroom door I didnt dream it all Over the next week the story starts to circulate My boys called the groom on the day of the wedding to chastise him for not showing up The groom (Jason) is confused as to why strangers are calling him about him not showing up to some wedding Jason says hes tired of prank calls his break is done hes going back to work They get tired of him playing dumb so the go to his job Jason recognizes them as his gf friends and talks to them explaining if he had known he was getting married he obviously wouldnt have gone to work Felicia says she told him the wrong date !?! But no!?!? He actually never knew Every time they were together she would warn people not to mention the wedding because Jason was upset that his late mother wasnt able to attend so the wedding is a touchy subject Felicia- who has all of Jasons info would take out credit cards under his name max then out & when Jason gets a call informing him of transactions hes despite them cause why would he be spending money on a wedding if hes not getting married So the whole time Felicia knew this was a scam but she asked my cousin her best friend for money & she emptied her tuition fund to pay for a wedding Felicia knew was fake Ps Jasons mother is alive & well The only people at the wedding was my family & a few church friends Her family didnt show (cause they knew better His family-cause duhh Ohhhh & Jason & Felicia are still together,Left-Department4499,16209292910,6

SHE IS SO ANGRY YOU RUINED THE WHOLE DAY DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT COMING TO THE WEDDING!!!!" she stormed off and I couldnt say a word I will never forget how all of my roommates treated me as if i were a criminal out to ruin the wedding when all that happened was a man on my plane had a medical emergency and this was outside of my control They wouldnt hear me out or speak to me for days and mind you at the time I considered one of the roommates to be my closest friend I said nothing planned on not going to the wedding I eventually was able to explain to my roommate - the future husband what had happened and I did receive a thank you for the gift but he still said \[Bride\] is too upset with you I would stay away from her She eventually called me after weeks of everyone shunning me and said she had time to think and sees how it was not intentional for me to miss her shower Somehow I ended up going to the wedding in the end and all was fine but after my roommate who got married moved out I basically never talked to either of them again and started distancing my "closest friend" because now I could see their true colors I knew this group of people was a little self absorbed and talked badly about each other from time to time but I decided that if I didnt give them a reason to talk about me I could live with it because they had other redeeming qualities At that point though I was done overlooking the red flags I made sure to add more money in the gift than I normally would have to cover for the meal I never got to eat at the bridal party It just taught me a valuable few lessons for one thing dont rely on travel times and also if you arent that close with someone you can politely decline their wedding invitation especially if your gut tells you to Lastly if you are feeling unwell before a flight dont get on the plane tell someone in the airport what is going on,stuffybummers,16209179220,2

Groom looks at me and says "hey dude stay right there Ill be right back" So I waited around got another drink and chatted with some other guests until he came back Before long they were sitting everyone down for dinner service and I figured he got caught up with the in-laws or other guests He never came back to talk to me but I never realized he didnt come back AT ALL Im in the middle of eating a succulent cut of prime rib and I look up to see the bride greeting and thanking all her guests This chick is in TEARS and she looks like a fucking Tim Burton character with all the mascara running down her face Im looking around and everyone is having the same reaction as me "uh what the fuck is going on?" A couple minutes later I get a tap on my shoulder from one of the grooms friends I chatted with earlier "Dude we gotta go Grab your stuff we are leaving" It was such a weird scene that I honestly didnt ask questions and jumped in a car with a bunch of guys I didnt know So of course Im asking what the fuck is going on and where are we going Apparently when the bride handed the groom her phone to play music some text messages popped from a random guy that said "why did you marry that guy?

gxzm9he,nbaar5,although NOT considered a ruined wedding my aunt-in-law joined a Ponzi scheme (no not Bernie Maidoff) she tried to get me to join and yes I heavily considered because I knew it was ROUND one meaning I would have made bank and I did not need to advertise to anyone but I never opted in anyhow aunt-in-law told EVERYONE about this biz and she came out 60k up now round 2 she tried to get more since she was the "successful" one but I knew round 2 would be a complete failure she convinced a cousin-in-law who was getting married to join they did NOT have the money but she "loaned" them 10k (verbally) so that they could pay for the wedding so the # of people went from 200 party to 500 party anyhow after round 2 from the ponzi aunt-in-law lost MORE than she invested from both rounds 1 and 2 she then went back to those who "verbally" promised to join asking for money even the cousins-in-law they actually went up to her for $$$ because they put a HUGE downpayment for a 500 party wedding long story no one forked money because those who promised could NOT pay LOL that one year it was a bit touchy but the following year life was slightly back to normal,BlueFit01,16209203980,2

gy1lmx6,nbaar5,I was a groom The "closest" friends of the bride that were grooms and bridesmaid ghosted her after the wedding She made us get specific tailor made outfits for her wedding so it would match her theme We paid for them of course That wasnt that bad but she also asked them to gift her money on repeated occasions so she could afford the wedding I guess that rubbed them the wrong way We got so MANY pictures in our outfits so fucking many I guess videos as well And she was left with all those memories of people who no longer speak to her I think those friends suck and they can suck a dick to be honest The bride wasnt all that nice at that time but they could at least tried to talk to her She eventually got divorced so I guess she doesnt look at those pictures anymore?,renewalrobot,16209521960,5

We didnt want it big anyway This one guy that showed up with the preacher(girl i worked with at a fast food place) got way too drunk The one bridesmaid didnt show up nor the ring bearer who was her grandson My brothers then girlfriend fit in the dress and played the part for me My dog was the ring bearer The guy that got way too drunk decided to tell me all my ex husbands friends are idiots etc And my ex over heard I tried breaking it up but made it worse I sat in the cabin we rented and cried while i heard him talking shit about me saying I was agreeing with drunk guy? I told him he needed to calm down then he started fighting with me saying I punched him in the eye? He was fake wincing but would have both his eyes open when we wasnt paying attention  It was an awful mess i never got paid for 2 of the bridesmaid dresses 3 of them dont talk to me any more because theyre either on drugs or were caught cheating on their husband (preacher ) My aunt stated she didnt come because the parking was confusing Then admitted she thought I was just getting married for money lesson learned for sure!

gy0sntu,nbaar5,I one time booked a room for a weekend which was at a very classy Hotel in Scranton PA called the Raddison I left the hotel spent about $600 on drinks between me and a random chick I met I was completely fucking loaded I went back to the hotel where a wedding was taking place in a dinning room thats adjacent to the main desk of course the doors were wide open when I went to the desk and it was soo quiet you could hear a pin drop in the room full of at least 100 people I was soo wasted that I had lost my room keys I told the lady at the desk I needed new keys and she said I was too drunk and that I needed to leave after I had just paid like $1500 for a huge suite hours earlier that completely set me off as I just wanted to go to sleep and sober up at that point but she said if I didnt leave that she was going to call the police I told her that if she did that I was going to piss on her desk after I argued with her for a few more minutes she said she was calling the police and went to the back to use the phone so as a man of my word in the awe of the people at the wedding who could see me I started pissing all over her desk computer paperwork everything mind you the Scranton police station is about three blocks away if that so the police were there in a minute by the time I had pulled my pants up and got finished cursing her out the cops came in through the front door I then ran into the middle of the wedding dipping and ducking behind people yelling dont shoot at the top of my lungs and everyone started panicking and running in every which direction which really pissed the officers off they ended up finally catching up to me and slamming my face onto the floor even after I had laid on the floor surrendering and bruised my face really bad They charged me with Public Intoxication which was later dismissed because I told them I would sue them for police brutality if they pressed charges which I still did anyway and won but after that I received a Civil Suit from the people whos wedding it was for the cost of their wedding night because I completely ruined it in their words and from the Raddison for all the money that they had reimbursed the couple already for what happened the police department ended up paying for it because I was brutally assaulted by them and only ran because the cop had drawn his weapon no reason to shoot me over a citation Lol  Wasnt funny then but it is now if youre reading this and that was your wedding I am sorry but I feared for my life and I knew the cop wouldnt shoot into the wedding with all of those witnesses and cameras rolling my apologies ,Playboisteve,16209379570,-3

gxzos8g,nbaar5,Not a ruined wedding but pretty close Friend got married and to save money they hired one of the brides cousins to do the pictures since he was just starting out in photography and wouldnt charge them muchApparently he had a major thing for one of the bridesmaids because 80-90% of the pictures were of her The entire bridal party was looking at the pictures together for the first time after the wedding and were stunned as picture after picture was just of the one bridesmaid The bride and groom were furious and the bridesmaid who all the pictures were of was incredibly uncomfortable and embarrassed When they confronted the photographer his defense was "she looked so beautiful I had to capture it on film" Worst part is he still has all of the pictures backed up on his computer God only knows what disturbing collage hes made with of them,jcreamer88,16209214640,1
gxzr7nb,nbaar5,A family friends son was getting married We were all really close so it was more of a "raised as cousins" situation Immediately after they got engaged the brides sister got engaged The rumor is that she demanded it from her then boyfriend The brides father "asks" (demands or hell cut funding) that they have a double wedding so he doesnt have to pay for two weddings and so extended family doesnt have to travel all that way twice I dont even know where to start Bride- M Groom- T Brides sister- B We walked in and the church was split in two If you were there for M and T you were on the right if you were there for B you went to the left Only the brides family was on Bs side while the right side was almost completely full This would later cause issues Then the bridesmaids came out Two separate color schemes B had this awful teal and pink (think cotton candy) theme while M and T had pretty oranges and fall colors B wanted a friend to officiate instead of the pastor that M and T wanted While the friend was officiating the ceremony off of his phone it dinged He stopped talking chuckled and answered the text He pronounced M and T first and we cheered without realizing that they were going to do each couples vows and such and then they would kiss at the same time B stared daggers into the crowd while we all awkwardly sat through her stuff One of our other family friends is a professional photographer Like teaches at multiple colleges professional B insisted that an aspiring photographer friend take the photos instead Our friend was desperately trying to give this girl tips so all the photos wouldnt be trash but B was pissed that he would "come in here like he knows anything" He quietly asked the orange party to stay behind so he could take some good pictures of them The reception was set up similarly We were only allowed to sit at tables with orange decorations if we were there for M and T teal and pink for B Now this is really where sh** hit the fan B wanted a "classy" wedding T had a friend that was part of a jazz quartet Whats classier than that? A white trash DJ with a green mohawk They would switch off each hour So everyone that was there for M and T would dance for an hour then sit down when the DJ came back out All the food was set up buffet style so we all went through M and T wanted a simple taco bar Whats classier than that? Lil smokies in BBQ sauce and Mac and cheese Then B got pissed because M and Ts guests had eaten their food That was all on the same table With no labels The brides father was then caught moving gifts from M and Ts gift table (that was overflowing) over to Bs table When confronted he said they wouldnt miss the presents and B was upset she didnt have as much My parents went off on him about how all these people were here to support M and T these gifts were thoughtfully picked out for them it was his own fault his little brat didnt have anything and that from that point on someone would be stationed at the tables to make sure it didnt happen again We also have this family tradition where someone will make some homemade warzonka (Polish Whiskey) then you can buy a shot to dance with the bride The money goes to the couple for a honeymoon fund The father pulled our cousin (who made the whiskey) aside and let her know that half would be going to B She said okay and made eye contact when she put all the money in the basket on M and Ts table Everyone left early because the reception started at 3 and B refused to cut the cake until 7 No one wanted to sit through more of her whining and tantrum throwing It was literally just one thing after the other and we were all just about ready to throw her into a lake M and T are still happily married and have a beautiful baby girl B got divorced 7 months after the wedding,extra-toasty1108,16209224960,1
gxzwxfn,nbaar5,I work in weddings as a filmmaker We had a very very nice couple with lots of money and so had their event at the Biltmore Its my job to keep antennae up for mood and energy so I can capture magic while not overdoing it and so I try to read the room Something was off about our nice bride They were much older this was a second marriage for both As someone in recovery it became very clear to me that the bride was using something to get through her day aided by some day-champagne Talking and doing things with her eyes half closed lots of dreamy smiles Slight extra effort from everyone to make it a nice day especially her two young adult daughters A new son with a nanny who was a total tiny tyrant By the ceremony she was at her sleepiest She dreamwalked down the aisle and through her ceremony The groom was fine but had a big frown/smile all day a face dominated by worry lines Fast forward to the reception and toasts There were very very few guests and those in attendance were not close friends or extended family that we could tell Turns out the bride was the grooms receptionist or office assistant he was a doctor They had a long affair that ended previous relationships and decided to get married The majority of the people in their lives were thus absent from the wedding A compassionate father of the bride gave a very kind toast and during his speech he had to pause and tell his daughter "dont cry its okay" She had broken down in tears A very difficult and sad wedding but he had a beautiful Ferrari that they wanted featured so at least they had some fancy gorgeous pictures,denvertheperson,16209249050,1

Please elaborate further on what your definition of high is and how it is structured Also ibuprofen is a drug with a high that makes you less swollen and Id rather get the laughing gas at the dentist than raw dog a root canal In my opinion this question is entirely too vague for a proper response because if these people are willing to go through extreme pain for the dentist or doctor they are deluding themselves severely And dont get me started on my prescription became a habit of self-medication to alleviate the underlying condition train of thought Some people need their "medicine" to survive whether or not it comes from an actual doctor Think benzos Now you can complete the circle with my first sentence lols Final answer: Id like to take the money but its entirely unrealistic unless I just plan on being dead from the first easily treatable thing that makes me unhealthy to the point of dead Like sepsis and the removal of body parts and not being able to take pain meds all wrapped up neatly to kill you from your first infection Ramblingsorry Im actually kind of drunk with an ear infection currently,LeifInman,16423165020,1

gx69ua5,n5mj47,So my family was very active and prominent in the Lakewood CA community My great grandparents actually owned several plots before houses were built and made a killing flipping/remodeling the houses after being built (1949-1950 so imagine that kind of money today) Over time my great Grandparents (well just refer to them as GGs) house became the "hub" for babies and teens to be abandoned there and my great grandparents would just raise them or help find families to raise them There was actually a scandal about baby swapping between housewives during that time Anyway because of that my GGs became very in tune with the neighborhood and getting to know everyone who moved in nearby My grandpa lived in the house next door to them so my mom and her brother were practically raised in that house too Across the street from them was "Omar" (I think he uses reddit so I wont use his real name) and his parents He was about 5-6 years older than my mom Omar and his family became very close with mine very quick Not in a weird creepy "I want to see what you have inside your house" way either Like were still friends with their family to this day When my mom was a teen she really struggled because my GGs spoiled her and all the kids Outside of flipping houses my Great Grandpa was one of the head bosses at Firestone in South Africa before my mom was born in 1972 I think they got back to the states in 1969-1971 So needless to say they were well off enough to spoil any kids Because of this her parents werent really sure what to do so they almost treated it like a lost cause situation until my mom was about 15-16 When my mom was that age her and Omar were in a secret relationship The guy truly loved my mom and she him but their age difference made it hard Cue my mom getting pregnant at 16 And heres the kickernot with me (Im her firstborn) When Omar found out they knew my GGs would have taken the baby to raise so my mom could focus on her life and finish school While thats not a terrible idea it really should have been up to the ppl who created said baby So yes they told everyone she was pregnant But they did it from Mexico where Omar and his family are from Of course my family were getting ready to go get her Somehowmy mom calmed them down enough to listen and convinced them to let her stay She actually thrived out there Finished high school learned Spanish fluently Shes already half Mexican but she never learned as a child By the time she was due for the baby she had a miscarriage :( Idk the details surrounding it but my aunt swears my mom was never the same after She got back to the states about 6 months to a year after the miscarriage She doesnt know that I know the whole story because I dont want to further her trauma or make her talk about it,taintedbeef2,16203223840,3

gx2v40k,n5mj47,It wasnt so much a secret but something that I didnt know about until very recently - my grandad who was a piece of shit died on New Years Eve in 2018 Absolutely nobody was sad about it; my dad only kept in contact with him because he felt he had to I didnt have to go to the funeral happily but when my dad came back he said he shouldve guessed the old man would be VERY specific in his will about what was to be done with his body (grave coffin etc) Turns out my great-grandfathers mother (so grandads dads mum) had a mental break and couldnt look after my great-grandfather when he was a kid so he was raised by her two sisters my grandads great aunts My great-grandad was a fairly wealthy man he was a successful fruit salesman at Covent Garden and my grandad was his only child - my great-grandfather ended up predeceasing the great aunts and all the money went to my grandad When the great aunts died - these women who had RAISED my great-grandad and by all accounts absolutely adored my grandad - this POS decided to save money - despite the fact that he had recently inherited a significant amount of money from his father who definitely wouldve wanted them properly taken care of - and have them buried in a paupers grave Aka their bodies were placed in a mass grave without a marker so he could save a couple hundred pounds Apparently his justification was that they were dead so it didnt make any difference to them Funnily enough it seems to have mattered to him enough to specify in his will that the same was *not* to happen to him I still get angry thinking about it Theres no way of tracking down their remains or ever giving them proper graves as the records simply werent kept I strongly disliked him when he was alive having gotten the rough shapes of my dads terrible childhood and I fucking hate him now hes dead My dads a better person than I am because if my father had treated me the way he treated him I wouldve cut off all contact as soon as possible So not exactly a secret but something that was kept secret from me until the old man was dead probably partly by accident and partly because my parents knew I wouldnt be civil to him if Id known the full extent of just how much of a shithead he truly was,mayfriends,16202517480,1

gx35y9h,n5mj47,1 Grandma didnt die mysteriously she committed suicide after a long battle with depression and received no help because of shitty Christian values my favorite of which being "If youre struggling then God has abandoned you and you need to repent in order for him to love you again and then you will feel better" 2 My "uncle" (actually a distant cousin who married into the family but is old enough to be my grandpa) is a pedophile and abused his youngest son after the oldest "fought him off" The oldest son did a lot of victim blaming and threatened my mom for being a support system to the victim and his family (they were adults by the time this came out) The victim is now an advocate for male sexual abuse survivors especially in Christian circles and has a loving family and support system and is doing very well 3 The family asshole is a confirmed asshole News of his affair broke and with it all of the shitty things he has ever done He also outed himself as an abuser during this time It was one of those situations where you know something is wrong but you dont know what exactly Now we all know in gratuitous detail exactly what was/is wrong Fuck you Joel 4 A different "uncle" (biological distant cousin who is old enough to be my grandpa) is gay and that was the main "secret" for a very long time which I believed for a time was why he was ostracized from the family Turns out its actually because he was caught having an affair with a student (he was a professor at a Christian college) and turned into a major asshole to his wife and children after that came out He was ostracized because the family decided to protect the wife and kids from his shitty behavior not because hes gay (although I believe that was a factor for a while regardless of whether anyone wants to acknowledge that) Things are much better with him now and he attends family events with his partner but his children largely dont speak to him due to a lot of abuse in the home and loads of internalized homophobia and his ex-wife is always more welcome and protected because even today he is unnecessarily a dick to her By accounts from the kids she was always a good person to him and is accepting of his sexuality and partner so the vitriol seems unfounded but who knows honestly 5 My dad was an ex con whole stole a bunch of money Thats not the secret though The secret was he continued to inappropriately handle finances for the remainder of his life which left me and my mom to deal with unknown and extreme financial situations after his death Turns out he owed a lot of people money who were adamant about getting repayment and took out loans in my name that I had no knowledge of He was stashing parts of his paycheck aside to "take care of" these things without anyones knowledge which doesnt work out when you no longer make a paycheck When people tell you who they are believe them,Sunflower414,16202567730,1

h0u98t2,ntofxm,Everything to do with [Hadj Mohammed Mesfewi](https://enwikipediaorg/wiki/Hadj_Mohammed_Mesfewi?wprov=sfla1) He was a shoemaker who lived in Morocco in the late 19th and early 20th century He and his accomplice a 70 year old woman called Annah used to drug and kill young women who came to the shop Eventually one of the victims parents traced her movements to the shop and after the remains of 36 mutilated corpses were discovered nearby Mesfewi and Annah were questioned - and tortured Annah didnt survive but Mesfewi confessed to murdering them usually for a tiny amount of money His initial sentence was crucifixion - a very unusual punishment even then However there were many protests from powerful foreign embassies and Morocco couldnt do much against them Instead he was sentenced to beheading a more common punishment However the mood in Marrakech was that this was far too lenient so they settled on immurement - being walled up alive A special cell was constructed in the wall of the bazaar about 2 X 2 X 6 feet Chains were attached to one wall to ensure he would be kept standing Mesfewi wasnt told of his fate until the morning of his execution - when he was led screaming in chains and slowly bricked up inside Once the last course had been laid the crowd would fall silent until he started screaming when they would cheer He screamed nearly constantly for two days On the third day he fell silent,mordenty,16230159050,4375
h0ttdew,ntofxm,Tsujigiri ( or  literally "crossroads killing") is a Japanese term for a practice when a samurai after receiving a new katana or developing a new fighting style or weapon tests its effectiveness by attacking a human opponent usually a random defenseless passer-by in many cases during nighttime I cant imagine how terrifying it must have been being an innocent traveler walking a trail at night when suddenly an elite swordsman just materializes from the shadows and begins butchering you and your family just for fun and hes going to get away with it too because this was during the lawless sengoku period when samurai where a protected elite class Its just disturbing to me Edit: Appearently there is a Japanese historian that argues that the *intentions* of these killings may not always be for merely testing blades and that a more common reason might be robbery but regardless of the circumstances surrounding it what is known for certain is that innocent passer-bys are being slain from the shadows by an untouchable elite class during the Sengoku Honestly I dont care their motive the end result is civilians being dismembered and disemboweled randomly and in the dark of night for lols and/or money,DivineBanana,16230084520,11847

h0vru2g,ntofxm,LONG STORY I have never shared this story that I can remember It sometimes gives me nightmares Maybe if I share it I can let some of it go Its a very long story I worked as a temp when I was first out of college about 30 years ago As anyone who temps knows its a very diverse pool of people you come across as coworkers One co-worker of mine was a woman from another state I wont mention names or states so any details are changed for reasons that will be obvious She was an older lady and she was missing an eye She did not have an artificial eye Just no eye Ill call her Grace Grace confided in me one day that she had lost her eye during a carjacking in a major metropolitan city She had been shot three times and raped she said Her husband was in "the military" and was overseas in combat He would be coming home from his tour and retiring after this tour She regularly sent him care packages of personal supplies and food She had an adult daughter but her daughter was estranged and she didnt get to speak to her often Grace was always lecturing me to "call your mom it means a lot" She bought a new SUV when her husbands military pay came he had told her to get one as soon as it came in It was pretty nice nicer than any vehicle I ever could afford I visited her house a couple of times She had a large parrot that talked She said it missed her husband terribly and sometimes when she let it out of its cage she would tease him and say "Wheres papa?" and the bird would go looking around for him Although she was a little odd I figured I would be too if the things that had happened to her had happened to me But some of the things she said sometimes threw me off a little and I started getting some "spidey sense" feelings once in a while One day I was reading the news online and there was an article about an inmate at the state corrections prison who was suing the state for "maltreatment" I think I read it three or four times because something seemed familiar to me about the name At first I thought maybe I had heard about the story before But when I got to work the next day it struck me that the name was Graces husbands name It was a fairly unusual name I kept it to myself though because who knows there could be more than one person by that name But it kept bugging me One day near the holidays she said he was coming home for leave and she was excited to see him She would have to drive far upstate to the base he was stationed from I was so glad for her and it seemed like the person in the paper was someone else entirely After the holidays he went back to the middle east Things went back to normal But Grace started getting really stress-y saying he might have to stay after this tour as well They needed the money because temping wasnt making enough And the military offers a lot to stay in She was hoping he would not have to She began giving me gifts both of food and trinkets I usually have a suspicion of gifts and I associate them with someone trying to make up for something I know its a pessimistic outlook but its rooted in my childhood Anyway it made my senses tingle again I started turning down the gifts at one point I also did not feel comfortable visiting her anymore She just began to unsettle me As spring came I was reading the news and I saw the follow-up for the story about the prisoner and I got curious so I looked up the entire lawsuit He had gotten a six figure settlement but was still not getting out The internet was not what it is today and searching for people online was pretty rudimentary But court cases were available and came up pretty quickly in a search engine As I read the entire transcript I was horrified to find out that the man who was suing for maltreatment was a rapist and a child molester He had been in prison for over twenty years and his parole was denied because he was listed as "dangerous and violent" As I browsed the legal site I came across some of his earlier court proceedings Apparently he had years added to his sentence because when one of his victims was about five his girlfriend had brought her in for visitation and had helped him get away with molesting her in the jail visitation room He had gotten caught she somehow escaped criminal charges but they took the child away I still had no proof that this was Graces husband but I was so freaked out by the story and had nightmares for several nights in a row about what I had read And working with Grace became excruciatingly hard Things that never alarmed me before began actually frightening me One day she left for lunch and wanted to go somewhere in her vehicle but I said I brought my lunch and wanted to stay at work She seemed overly cranky about it After lunch I was working for about an hour when I realized she hadnt returned from lunch Supervisors began asking me if I knew where she went I said I didnt but I hoped she hadnt gotten in an accident or something At break time I went for a walk which I usually went on with Grace She still was not back As I went around the corner she pulled up in the SUV I told her I was worried something had happened and that the supervisors were asking about her She was angry and said I should have covered for her better I was kind of offended She then told me to get in the vehicle that she would give me a ride back to work I told her I would just walk back it was just around the block for heavens sake She suddenly yelled at me "WHY WONT YOU GET IN THE CAR? JUST GET IN!" I was like no thanks I will meet you back there When she finally got into the office she sat down and in a low voice said "Why wont you ride in my car? Why are you refusing to come to my house? I know something is wrong what is the problem?" I said there was no problem what could be the problem? Theres no problem She said "Oh there is a problem" under her breath The supervisor came over and asked to talk to her and she was let go She told me I should have covered for her Not really in my nature unless there is something life or death though Then she left angry The supervisor saw her yell at me and then they talked to me They said not to feel bad they had let her go for other reasons She had falsified information on her entrance paperwork and it was some serious stuff I was like was it about her background? And they said yeah did you know about her husband? And I said I thought he was overseas They just shook their heads I didnt ask and they didnt tell me any more For years after even after I married and changed my name and moved all over creation I still was fearful of her And the husband Because it turns out it was him And he was the one who had shot her And even though he did that and harmed children she was still faithful to him I kept an eye on his sexual offender status for years One day he was paroled So he was actually out there somewhere Terrifying But one year when I searched his status it said he was no longer registered as an offender because he was deceased I had never looked Grace up but when I did I saw she was deceased as well No clue how either one died just saw the death notices I hope their child or children are ok somewhere I cant imagine being a close family member to those two I sometimes wonder what might have happened the day she wanted me to get in her vehicle Even back then I had read enough true crime to know some possible outcomes TLDR: I once had a coworker whose husband shot her in the face taking her eye and molested her child and other children and she stuck by him and built an entire story about him being a soldier overseas when he was really in prison for violent rape and molestation Which she had some collaboration in They are both long deceased,Reality_Defiant,16230471390,92
h0vqye2,ntofxm,Growing up as a tween/teen I had 2 family members that scared me off dating/commitment One of my cousins came into a comfortable amount of money when her grandmother died She had plans to buy a home with her husband and have a baby Her husband on the other hand believed that when she received the money she would immediately leave him so he decided he would incapacitate her and keep her with him forever He stabbed her in the spine Called the emergency line and said she fell on a knife He expected that as she was fighting for her life and ability to walk she would lie to keep him out of prison Wrong!

h0uf68e,ntofxm,The Hinterkaifeck Murders Hinterkaifeck was a small independent farmstead in Bavaria Germany around 70km (43 Miles) north of Munich Near the end of March 1922 the people living on began noticing more and more weird incidents A newspaper from Munich was found near the entrance to the Farmstead two weeks before the murders even though nobody on the Farm or living near it had ever bought or read it Their Neighbors noticed tracks in the snow leading to the Farmstead in the days prior several times even though none of the Inhabitants had left due to the Weather One of their door-keys suddenly vanished and the Farmer Andreas Gruber noted to Neighbors and friends several times that he could have sworn to have spotted a lone man watching the Farmstead from the edge of the forrest but nobody believed him At one point he tried to get help from others after he had hears steps on the families attic and couldnt find anybody there when he went looking but nobody believed him and so he had to return without help One of the reasons why nobody believed him was that he had been convicted of having been in an incestous relationship with his Daughter in 1915 and it was widely believed that he was the actual father of her two-year old Son Josef On the 31st of March 1922 an unknown Assailant broke into the Farmstead and murdered all 6 Inhabitants with [this farming-tool](https://imagejimcdncom/app/cms/image/transf/none/path/sc53fabfa55e420c3/image/ibb603040ded23579/version/1583149567/mordwaffe-hinterkaifeck-reuthauejpg) The Farmer Andreas Gruber his wife Czilia and their widowed Daughter Viktoria Gabriel which had moved back to the farm were all brutally beaten to death near a door leading from the Stable to the Barn The Assailant then entered the main house killed the still sleeping Maid Maria Baumgartner and finally killed Viktorias 7-year old Daughter Czilia Gabriel and her 2-year old Son Josef who was still in his crib The Assailant didnt leave immidieatly but spent another couple hours at the farm at least since cows had been milked and the entire storage of bread been eaten Even worse forensic studies concluded that the 7-year old Czilia had lived in agony for atleast another two hours after the assailant had tried to murder her Due to the farms isolated location nobody discovered the murders for another 4 days until the Neighbors grew concerned due to the family not showing up to Sunday-mass or answering when one of them had come over to help repair some machinery When the police from Munich arrived at the scenery it was noted that the Attic had covered in hay likely to damp steps and that several roof-tiles had been moved or removed allowing someone hiding on it to oversee the entire Farm with ease They also found out that it was impossible to hear what was going on in the Barn and Stable from the living room which lead them to believe that the Assailant had lured the family into the barn one-by-one and beat them to death there Despite days of thorough searching and questioning of everybody even remotely close to the farm or family a bounty of 100000 Mark for any tips leading to the arrest of the assailant and even handing the skulls of the victims over to Mediums at the end out of desparation no one was ever arrested or convicted for the Murders although a number of people were suspected The most promising suspects were: \- Karl Gabriel: Viktorias Husband had been reported killed by an artillery-shell during the Battle of Arras but after the Murders some people had claimed to have spotted him in the Area some even claiming to have talked to him He had apparently heard that his wife had another child after he "died" (the 2-year old Josef) and killed the family out of revenge The theory got some new wind after WW2 when several german PoWs from the Region upon returning home had stated that they had been questioned by a Soviet Officer with a bavarian accent while in captivity that claimed to have been Gabriel especially since some of the original witnesses claimed that Karl stated he would flee to russia after the murders Since his Comrades from WW1 insisted that he had been killed however the police dropped this lead \-Lorenz Schlittenbauer: The Mayor of the nearby village of Grbern he had been suspected to be the Father of Viktorias youngest child and to have killed the family to avoid paying child-support His house was the closest to the farm theoratically allowing him to spy on it and go back and forth between them without anyone noticing More importantly he was among the three people that discovered the Corpses While the others two were still shocked about the 4 dead bodies in the Barn Lorenz already went into the main house and audibly unlocked the main door He claimed that the key had been in the lock despite the family reporting the only key missing just a day before the murder Even years later he was suspected because during speculations in the Tavern about the murder he would sometimes refer to the murderer from as "I" and make other cryptic comments But no direct evidence was found \- Josef Brtl: A former Baker Brtl had been diagnosed with mental illnesses and been put in a mental assylum but fled from there on year earlier Since he was suspected of having taken part in another murder in 1919 and several witnesses claimed to have seen him he became a prime suspect but the police was never able to find him \- Brothers Gump: Anton Gump and three others had already been on the arrest-list of the Police in Munich due to being suspected of being involved in the murder of 9 other Farmers in Silesia during their time in a *Freikorps* and they were suspected of possibly being responsible for the Murder of the Grubers too along with Antons Brother Adolf No evidence against them was found but Antons & Adolfs Sister testified on her deathbed that her brothers had told her that they had been responsible That led to the case briefly being reopened in 1951 but ultimately no evidence was found There were also several problems with the Investigation Only 5 photos of the Place were taken and no further Evidence inside the building secured Despite one witness stating that they saw an unknown Man firing up the Farms baking-oven and the oven emitting an extremely foul and unusual stench no investigation was undertaken as to what had been burned in it The police classified it as a robbery with murder for a long time despite large sums of money that were placed openly inside the house being left untouched There was also no deeper investigation into the reasons behind the victims displaying differing degrees of wounds Viktoria had not only been beaten to death with the farmtool previously she had also been strangled while the others were killed just with blows to the head and the body of Josef being covered after he had been killed The most egregious discrepancy however was the Farmtool used to kill the family The original Police-report states that the murderweapon was found by one of three Neighbors that found the bodies in the stable However when the farm was torn down one year after the Murders the wrecking-crew discovered the actual murder-weapon hidden on the attic still covered in blood and tufts of hair Forensics also discovered that a slightly loose screw on the tool found in the attic matched the wounds on the familys head exactly which begs the question why the police initially claimed another tool was used,IronVader501,16230187050,42

The insurance agent The day after the fire their ladder was found at the bottom of a ditch near their house They also learned that their telephone line was cut A man admitted to cutting the line by accident when he was stealing a pulley system from their house - but no record exists of who the man is Given that Jennie got a phone call at 12:30 AM the line wouldve been cut between 12:30 and 1:30 AM George bulldozed the home a few days after the fire to start a memorial to his children A bus driver later claimed he saw people throwing "balls of fire" at the house and during the spring one of the remaining Sodder children found a small dark green rubber-looking ball in the brush near the house There were many cases of people claiming to see the Sodder children over time In 1949 the parents hired a pathologist to excavate the ruins of the house and a set of vertebrae were found - but they belonged to a body too old to be any of the children and showed no burn marks The parents put up a billboard on their property advertising a reward and had pictures of their children on it In 1967 they received a photo that looked like one of their sons grown up along with a letter that said "Louis Sodder I love brother Frankie Ilil boys A90132 [or 35]" George died in 1969 and Jennie died in 1989 The family took the billboard down after Jennie died The youngest Sodder child Sylvia died in April of this year Her first memory was her parents getting her out of the house I mean most likely they died in a fire but if they did who killed the Sodder children?

h0vq5l4,ntofxm,This is a long one Happened in my neighborhood when I was a kid Im not the original author The Luna Family In recent news it was announced that Death Row inmate Richard Djerf had been denied his last appeal Djerf had been convicted of killing four members of the Luna family in Maryvale in 1993 We have discussed this crime on TCiP a few times in bits and pieces so I decided it was about time to give it its own page here I had been following this case since it occurred and have seen some of the crime scene photos I cannot think of another crime equal in terms of innocent victims horror and cruelty Djerf actually plead guilty to four counts of capital murder his thinking being "If the judge or jury heard the details they would give me the death penalty" I agree Albert and Patricia Luna came from the copper mining region of Clifton-Morenci They married shortly after high school and intended to make a life in eastern Arizona in the mining industry A labor strike in 1983-1984 lead to problems and non-union workers being brought in Albert lost his job to a non-union worker and found difficulty finding gainful employment The family decided to leave Clifton and go to Phoenix to find work Family and friends warned them of the dangers of the big city but they were out of options and re-established themselves in west Phoenix Albert and Patricia had three children; Albert Jr 21 Rochelle 18 and Damien 5 Albert Jr had some issues with his new home town finally being arrested in 1992 for theft and burglary He also had taken to carrying a gun Rochelle was a popular outgoing girl with a job working the night shift at a grocery store Albert and Patricia were concerned for her safety but she insisted on earning money for college Damien was a typical 5-year-old and Albert Sr found steady work and was able to support his family Albert Jr worked as a night custodian at a nearby Safeway store His co-worker was Richard Djerf They were friends until January 1993 when Djerfs apartment was burglarized A television a VCR unit stereo equipment a car alarm and an AK-47 assault rifle were stolen Djerf was sure Albert Jr did it But Albert denied everything Djerf stewed and silently raged for months after Finally on September 14 1993 he decided he would take revenge Albert Jr would later admit to committing the burglary of Djerfs apartment In the late morning hours of September 14 1993 Djerf went to the Luna family home at 7202 W Monte Vista Street taking his 9mm Beretta handgun a knife latex gloves handcuffs red fuse cord and artificial flowers in a vase to use as a ruse to gain entry When Patricia answered the door to receive the flowers Djerf pushed his way into the house showing her his gun Djerf took Patricia into the master bedroom and bound her letting her five-year-old son Damien run free Later while holding Damien hostage Djerf freed Patricia and forced her to place items of property into the Luna family car including two VCR units a telephone a caller ID box a stereo CD player four watches change and a money clip with food stamps He then took Patricia and Damien into the kitchen and bound them to chairs facing each other with rope and black electrical tape More than once he asked Patricia whether she or her son should die first He also asked her if she knew the whereabouts of her son Albert Jr Around 3:00 pm Rochelle came home Djerf took Rochelle to her bedroom gagged her with tissue paper and tape tied her to the bed cut off and removed all of her clothing with a knife After raping her Djerf stabbed Rochelle four times in the chest and cut her throat At some point while still alive Rochelle vomited behind the gag and aspirated the vomit Djerf then returned to the kitchen and told Patricia he had just raped and killed her daughter Around 4:00 pm Albert Luna Sr arrived home from work Djerf handcuffed him forced him to crawl to the master bedroom and placed him face down on the bed He struck Albert in the back of the head multiple times with an aluminum baseball bat inflicting three large lacerations and spattering blood throughout the room Believing Albert to be dead he removed the handcuffs and taped his hands and wrists together leaving him on the bed He then walked to the kitchen and told Patricia that he had just killed her husband Djerf took a light fixture cut and stripped the wire and taped it to five-year old Damiens legs He flipped the switch but was unable to get the current to kill the little boy He then tried to snap Damiens neck "Like he had seen in the movies" Despite twisting the childs head all the way around he couldnt get the neck to break the same way Stallone could Meanwhile in the bedroom Albert Sr although badly injured regained consciousness and freed himself from the tape around his wrists In an effort to save his family he went to the kitchen and charged Djerf with a pocketknife wounding him seriously During the ensuing struggle Albert stabbed Djerf with enough force to drive a knife through his leg Djerf managed to pull the Beretta from his belt and shot Albert six times Albert fell to the kitchen floor and died at the feet of his wife and son Djerf was not content with just killing Patricias husband daughter and torturing her son Djerf repeatedly asked Patricia if she wanted to watch her son be killed or did she want her son to see her be killed All the time with Albert Sr lying dead at their feet Djerf finally grew tired of his game and shot both of them to death He poured gasoline over the bodies and initially intended to light it with the red fuse cord but children playing outside made him think he would be spotted when he left He put a pizza box and a rag on the stove and turned on the burners After seven hours of rape torment and butchery Djerf left the home For some reason the pizza box and rag failed to ignite the gasoline Albert Jr had not gone to his home the night of September 13 and did not return until 11:45 pm Numerous unanswered calls to the house had made him anxious When Albert Jr entered the home and discovered the bodies of his parents and brother he immediately left and drove to his girlfriends house where he called the police After murdering the Lunas Djerf went back to his apartment and had his girlfriend Elizabeth Boswell drive him to the hospital to get the injuries he received from Albert Sr treated He initially said he had been stabbed during a robbery attempt but admitted to her he committed the killings the following day Djerf told Boswell that he had murdered four members of the Luna family and described to her how he had done it He told her that the blood dripping from Patricias gunshot wound was "really awesome" and "you should have been there" He also bragged about the killings to two other friends On September 18 Phoenix Police executed search warrants on a motel room and Djerfs car and apartment The police found handcuffs a nine-millimeter Beretta a stereo CD player two VCR units a US West caller ID unit artificial flowers and a vase watches Rochelles charm necklace a cardboard knife sheath Patricias car keys a telephone loose change food stamps and a red fuse cord Police arrested Djerf later the same day At the time of arrest the police found a handcuff key and a newspaper section containing an article about the killings in his possession Djerf tried to act as his own attorney and ended up taking a plea deal where he plead guilty to four counts of Capital Murder When the sentence of four Death Penaltys was announced he shrugged "Well they can only kill me once" Djerf continued to not show any remorse saying "It was all my fault all my fault Im not crazy I dont hear voices I didnt have a terrible childhood I just did what I did" "Of course I regret it" Djerf said in 1995 "I wish Id taken someone with me that day and theyd have talked me out of it" On Wednesday July 24 2019 the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against him and allowed his death sentence to continue Albert Jr currently lives in Surprise He is on his second marriage and apparently has had no further run-ins with the law The Luna family is buried in Clifton

h0vuwic,ntofxm,One of the scariest true stories I know is the "House of Horrors" story that took place in France (sorry if this has already been mentioned!) its the story of a seemingly perfect family living an upper class life the Dupont de Ligonns had four children and two dogs Its the third ep of new unsolved mysteries season 2 Mrs DuPont was social and always had her blinds open (her neighbor mentions this often in the unsolved mysteries episode ) One day the blinds and curtains are closed mail starts to pile up eventually neighbors call the police who search the home They find nothing out of place except for sheets off the bed the family and the dogs are not at home but nothing seems amiss to them A letter was sent by Xavier (father /husband) to family and friends conveniently that the family went to America where they are secret spies for the DEA As the family and close friends put more pressure on French police they visit another time still they find nothing On April 21 2011 they search again and an officer notices something off with the terrace she finds the bodies of four children and Mrs DuPont along with their two dogs wrapped in bags with religious icons No blood no fingerprints and no dna were recovered at the scene to identify a killer The crime is thought to be committed by father / husband after more investigation it was found that he was essentially bankrupt and rather than face the embarrassment of telling his family he had no money he killed them One of the scariest things about this entire crime was the amount of time it took to actually find the victims the crime itself and the oldest child;away at college he was called back by his father under the guise of an emergency When he returned he was drugged and killed Xavier has never been found and either committed suicide or is on the run [House of Horrors](https://enwikipediaorg/wiki/Dupont_de_Ligonn%C3%A8s_murders_and_disappearance),AdorableCheck,16230497790,3

h0u6vi7,ntofxm,This one is scary to me because it highlights the intense lack of mental health care in this country and shows that horrific tragedies can happen in any family My family One of our local families in our convoluted family tree has a son who has been ill for a long time with paranoid schizophrenia He was in and out of care on and off medications He wasnt always like this We watched him grow up He was a good kid if a little defiant Several years ago he had gotten to a place where his parents felt comfortable allowing him to live independently in a home they owned about 20 minutes from their home He was stable and employed But as happens with many patients he went off his meds His parents stopped by to check on him and realized that he needed to be hospitalized again They tried to get him into the car but he was in the middle of a full-blown psychotic break All they saw was their baby in pain They didnt see the danger he posed His dad tried to muscle him into the car and the son went off Stabbed him in the neck with a pocket knife then as his wife tried to save him and call 911 he got a pistol and shot him dead We were probably as different as two people could be but this man was there for his grandkids when his daughter and son-in-law were in and out of addiction and jail He was a money-where-his-mouth-is church-every-Sunday work-the-overtime-if-offered kind of guy And he must have been so hurt and so scared His own son The son will never get out of prison And his mother will never be the same His siblings kids and grandkids sure arent Lots of people ask why his parents didnt put him in a mental hospital but there just arent many around and a lot of insurance in the US doesnt cover mental health care It has created a terrible and self-fulfilling cycle that feeds the prison pipeline and the homeless population The problem will get worse before it gets better The public isnt yet aware of the extent of the issue and certain factions can only be convicted of the urgency of an issue when they personally are impacted by it This terrifies me,Mamapalooza,16230147860,4

haw8ay2,pdzzrw,I was on the verge of getting married to my fianc (literally 2 weeks prior) when she went off and became a shell of herself She become a selfish monster and all she could focus was money She would stay up late on the phone dealing with "clients" for work not care about my work schedule or any acknowledgement She persuaded me to pay for things left and right (dress make up purses etc) and even to the point shes telling me to sell my house and take on maximum debt She seemed very convincing and I always thought she was looking at trying to build our future together She even refused to even spending any quality time together I thought it was all due to the stress of getting eloped However after a dinner with my parents they became suspect of her and thought she may have other intentions One day I asked her if she was willing to sign a non formal agreement/one liner saying we owe our own savings/RRSP/assets prior to the marriage and whatever happens after will be together She snapped at this and accused me of treating her like a thief I didnt ask her for a prenup but rather a simple and fair statement saying her assets are hers and my are my prior to the marriage We werent even going to take it to the lawyers to get a certified She stormed out but not before emptying everything in my house and leaving away with my garage opener I was in total disbelief and she never called or messaged ever again Few days later and as I was cleaning out the attic I found a box of hers in the attic from a long time back As I was packing it up I noticed a few pieces of paper stuck in a tax return binder In there were some of the most darkest stuff I ever saw my in life It looked to be dated from years ago up until recently and had her "diary" plan all laid out She never ever or will ever loved anyone aside from money It said she must hide her greed and money addiction to seem more professional and high class She never interned to work hard in her career and her only way to getting rich was to marry and divorce Some other stuff written includes "When thinking of marriage start thinking of divorce asap Blame the guy on small stuff and escalate to make the mans life miserable Trap him by investing in buying a house (shes a realtor after all) and then leave him with half Do that a few times while Im still young (before 35) to maximize my earnings for life Only sleep with people who can provide value to you I can never go back to where I immigrated from for fear of my failed last marriage/son I must learn to be patient to bait my targeted men and not lose my temper" There were a lot more in those 6 pages which was a true shocker to me I never imagined this was the person I was almost about to marry She was married before and never mentioned about the son She completely lied to me She never loved me or anyone else All she cared about was money She hide her house asset under her moms name and any chance she gets she sends most of her earnings overseas She was just an amazing actress I grew up in a simple family and never have I met someone who was so cold hearted and manipulative To think I spent more than 2 years with her and almost got married was almost too close This encounter crushed me I spoke to friends and they were in complete disbelief It felt like a movie Apparently this is starting to become a common practice for a lot of foreign asian girls coming from overseas in their late 20s to 30s At the end I lost quite a bit of money due to the elopement costs and time However I am very fortunate she lacked the patience and exposed her flaws/emotions before the marriage I felt like I dodged a bullet TL:DR almost married a con artist before her impatience and true character started to reveal,yyc_photography,16303004340,9

We cant treat pain with much other than highly dangerous opioids spotty antidepressants or literally deadening nerves Most alternative treatment involves exercise Viruses sometimes cant be treated and will inevitably kill their host Drug addiction can absolutely annihilate the human brain in some while others seem unperturbed for the most part Its nice to think if we get hurt or sick that someone can care for us easily that its just a matter of money but thats not quite true in many cases We have made leaps and bounds of course but it doesnt always work,honchell12,16302846100,6

gzszxxn,nmy1er,Oh I have so many! But some I didnt read here are: The stereotypical (!!!) millennial-advice to do what is best for you and not what society needs Honestly that is so egocentric as long as you are not absolutely independent If you want stuff from society you have to give stuff (meaningful stuff!) to society You cant just profit from other people and then only care about your own life and money For example I followed an Influencer for a long time until they told their followers that they considered emigrating somewhere else because the taxes in Germany are so high (he is a doctor and they are very wealthy) Like no you obviously profited from our system time to give something back so people with less possibilities can life a decent life?? Another one is the objectification of overweight women or POCs Many say it is empowering but its still objectification which is bad Concerning overweight people they deserve respect of course but there is nothing to romanticise an unhealthy lifestyle And of course the objectification of POCs is really concerning (called positive racism) Last one: If you cant imagine being a parent you are under no obligation to get kids Of course Im not talking about bad parenting or getting is danger due to medical conditions But like in the first example it is often used by people who say that they dont want to live another lifestyle and who are kind of egocentric Fact is that our society need young people if not you have a real problem (example Germany: The younger generations have to work until they are really old often five to ten! Years longer than our Grandparents because we obviously pay the rent of the older generation and less people for the same amount of old people means that one young person has to pay more) My father for example once told me that he could not imagine himself as a father when he got me (age 30 so not young!) but I can say that he is a really good father It depends on your ability and you willing to improve and learn Many people are not born to be good with children but they learn and become very good parents!,natasha_velina_,16222368500,2

(And you can shove your pedantic nonsense the intent is clear) **Greeting strangers** - I dont know you Why are you greeting me? **Small talk with strangers** - I dont fucking know you Leave me alone **Owning guns** - Broadly speaking British people will NEVER understand this and trying to articulate it to them is an utter waste of time A truly foundationally cultural impasse Being half American I understand it - but I wont even bother trying to explain it to them **Driving everywhere** - the country is designed from the ground up around car traffic Its bizarre In the UK I am within walking distance of my grocery store pizza place pub church friends coffee shop etc **"The Sprawl"** - The endless ugly repetitive sprawl I think George Carlin described this really well Just miles of Major malls framed by mini-malls next to mini-marts Gas stations garages fast food etc Just miles of telephone/ electrical wire running parallel to miles of identical characterless buildings strung across this beautiful nation Its so abhorrent and ugly but for Americans they are just used to it **The Tax system** - Americans will immediately jump to the defense of this with explanations about how easy it is or how you can save money or blah blah blah blah blah Its not the concept of doing your own taxes that are an issue per se (Though while I was in the UK I really preferred not having to do it myself) Its that your tax system is so convoluted so arcane so extensive so bloated that often you need a professional or a professional service to do it for you and it seems pretty clear to me (as an outsider) that this system is designed for 2 things 1) To promote a ridiculous and what should be a redundant industry of tax in order to keep a portion of society employed 2) To make it so complex that pretty much everyone is a criminal that the law can be selectively enforced at the governments desire **Your medical system** - Your medical care is great Your medical system is a horrific crime against humanity And that isnt hyperbole Its beyond me how Americans havent stormed these institutions and demanded their heads on pikes - but for Americans its just what they are used to As someone who grew up with socialized medicine your system is cruel ridiculous inhumane and utter nonsense And anyone who feels the urge to defend it is either ignorant of whats possible or a shill Its a fucking joke and its disgusting **Eating out** - this one is just kind of benign but I can tell you right now it would put a British person on edge when they first arrive The amount that Americans eat out but when youve lived here long enough you start to understand why Americans work long hours and its incredibly cheap to eat out compared to the UK You dont want to go back home at 9pm and start cooking for another hour only to eat at 10pm **Office Culture** - this was by far one of the biggest culture shocks for me and even now 6 years later I find it extremely grating Because America is so litigious office culture is I N C R E D I B L Y stifling No fun allowed Only total utter professionalism at all times At first when I arrived I thought "Maybe this is just this particular office" Nope It isnt Everyone puts on a big song and dance a big show nobody acts like themselves Its frustrating and exhausting Of all the things I miss from back in the UK - this is the top of my list I love just being myself I love just having a laugh in the office with my coworkers and my friends and not feeling like they will A) Be sensitive about it B) Be awkward about it Things are just infinitely more relaxed in a British office space I mean for fuck sake I got called up for swearing in the US when I got here SWEARING Among adults!

h0b0dp2,nq9fjc,A friend of mine works for a small luxurious hotel in London He told me the concerge system there is absolutely absurd Money buys everything Anything the clients want clients get They are told never to say no worst case they say "I dont think this is really appropriate" Obviously drugs and escorts are a classic He showed me 20 phone numbers of drug dealers in his phone to be able to get whatever drugs to the customers (he never buys though only gets people in contact) And for harder tasks he goes through professional concierges who charge A LOT \- You want a new Prada dress at 2AM for the party you are about to attend? Sure thing lets wake a few people up charge triple the price and split the benefit between people involved Have a good night madam \- You want tickets for the Wimbledon final that takes place tomorrow?

h0aaf6e,nq9fjc,I have worked at two Hotels that are rated by Forbes (formerly Mobil) and randomly "inspected" frequently and there is a very specific checklist of things the hotel/restaurants must do/offer in order to keep their rating We always had to be suspicious of any single diners because they could possibly be inspectors So you could be a regular Joe Schmoe but if you are dining alone you are going to get the 5 star treatment Once we had a particular woman staying at the hotel and somehow management figured out and confirmed she was an inspector They literally took security cam stills and printed them out to give to all employees so we would know who she was I still remember her name was Katrina  Something else interesting - one of the (5 star) restaurants I worked at (in a 5 star hotel) would frequently be closed for private events There was usually a contract written beforehand stating the group must spend a minimum amount of money We got automatic gratuity on whatever that minimum was but the goal was to go over so we would make more money The people at the events usually didnt know these details (they werent the ones paying) and towards the end of the night if they hadnt reached the minimum we would have to start pouring the most expensive wine and liquors to meet the goal Who wants a few rounds of McAllen 25 doubles etc And people still tipped cash on the open bars so it was easy to walk away with $500 a night in tips after those parties It was the easiest money I ever made ETA - MACALLAN!

h0ah4x8,nq9fjc,I worked at a 5 star hotel in England as a bartender Hosted events and stuff One thing that was common was my manager would just spam extra drinks onto the bill at events to make more money Or for example if a big wedding ordered 50 bottles of champagne theyd only give them 30 and would keep 20 back and if they ran out theyd have to buy more I reported this to Senior management and they just laughed saying its normal I actually got told off for not taking part in this,datguywilld,16226207820,128

Diamond members almost always got a pass -how did they book the room? If it was a 3rd party like Expediano pass -how many times had they stayed at our specific property? 5 or morepass -how much had they charged up?

I dont think anyone did that I am pretty sure the kitchen staff even put meat on the buffet that was past its "best by" date 2 Overbooking - during big events or fairs or festivals the hotel will sell more rooms than they actually have just to make more money It works in a way that Bc of that time period of an event you pay in advance and you cant cancel your booking Meaning if you dont show up you still pay The hotel expects people to not show up so they try to book as many people as possible and a few more 3 Secret signals - I used to work at the front desk the most time Its more or less the first impression and the one place everyone goes Guests scammers robbers you know If we were threatened or received a call of someone threatening us or the hotel for example saying they placed a bomb inside the hotel we had to subtly let our coworkers know The signal for "help" at the front desk was dropping a stapler For F&B when harassed by a guest and in need of help the go to was dropping something like a glass and making noise like loudly apologising Draw attention from other guests and employees so the guests will stop It was considered rude and unprofessional to just tell a guest to stop harassing you,mrstincan,16226127700,302

The inspector will have a Zoom call between themselves and hotel management The inspector will instruct this management team to point the cameras in whatever device they are using towards different points in a room As you can imagine this is easily bullshitted Also inspections in general are very seldom done 2 times a year in most cases with the inspection of around 5-7 rooms total on a busy trip It also takes a LOT to lose your "flag" (aka the privilege of calling yourself *insert brand here*) Ive seen us float between "unacceptable" and "failure" for extended periods of time and alas we still got our flag Oh heres a good one: Review your stay Not just through the company directly but also on Yelp Travelocity Tripadvisor etc Hotel management really dont like negative reviews on third party sites lmao If a specific places MGMT dont seem too interested in hearing your bad experience I promise someone higher up will go into panic mode and do whatever it takes to save face once your bad experience becomes very public Through Hilton in particular they take "SALT scores" very seriously and it is even included in the scoring of those inspections I mentioned earlier I could go on for hours but I will just leave this comment with: Dont be too hard on general employees like housekeepers and the front desk employees night auditors etc for things beyond their own control Sure some employees can be awful or rude and feel free to mention them in a review or to MGMT but some of us really do care how your stay is going and are empathetic to your needs through whatever undesirable situation is unfolding And despite working here I couldnt afford to stay here for even a single night if I wanted to so yes I really do agree that the room rate is quite often "bullshit" And theres nothing more embarrassing than checking someone into a room that is listed as Vacant/Ready in system but actually dirty/occupied (youd be surprised how often this can happen) Well there is a lot more but Ill save that for another day Ohhh and if it seems like the room rate went up an extra few hundred dollars because theres a Holiday it probably did,sinkfla,16226341100,10

h0aik6j,nq9fjc,*Im bored so here we go* I worked at a high end resort hotel in Arizona when I was 21-23 years of age I was a concierge Base rate room was about $600 a night but the suites could easily run you $1000+ a night Considering this was 17 years ago you can imagine how much pricier that was then If it was the off-season (the summer of Arizona) you could probably get a room for $200 a night as we were at like 10% occupancy max but then from late January to May wed be at near 100% capacity 24/7 We catered to famous people sports stars and overall fairly wealthy people who you would have never heard of but they make some of these "famous" people look poor For example we had a guy that that literally was worth hundreds of millions was retired and would come and basically vacation for 1-2 months at a time with his wife He had his own parking spot at the front door so he didnt need to be valet and drove some 1 million+ sports car in the evening (which is why the hotel liked it parked out front) but had some other super pricey Bentley theyd drive when their grand kids would visit They would disappear for a week room still paid for and not think twice about it They were not alone Here is a few things I learned the management does not want people to know People die in hotels: * The reality is that a lot of the customers with this kind of money to burn were older and often retired Sometimes these people just die in their sleep Every other month there was a death in the hotel Not a murder a medical emergency death The hotel was extremely discreet about the rooms that it happened in and made sure to scrub their computers of any of that data so employees couldnt even share it amongst themselves * There were cameras literally everywhere and we had a full security team that isnt just recording all the feeds but actively monitoring every single feed including every elevator We had motion sensors built into the cameras and they would flash a light at the monitor indicating movement at that camera There were nature trails around the desert on the outskirts of the hotel grounds and there were cameras out there About the only place there werent cameras was the inside of your room Lots and lots of people get caught getting down and dirty literally everywhere I remember when I was a fairly new employee and I didnt know this I used to take elevator rides with a coworker I was fooling around with and wed get a little frisky between floors Not too crazy but Im sure the security guys laughed at their daily grind show I ONLY found out when a "loss prevention" dude was like "Hey check out our command center" and he showed me all the cameras It was like he wanted me to figure it out on my own lol At least they were cool about it Also to note hotel workers hooked up a lot and knew about pretty much all of the dead camera spots I remember at the concierge it was me and 3 other girls It was basically a rotating shift of 2 people always 3 people on a busy day I had fooled around with all 3 of them at some point they all knew about it and no one cared because it was pretty much just fooling around out of boredom and relative attraction but no one ever seemed to get clingy in any department Seriously I cant think of a single "couple" in the entire hotel work force Lots of hooking up no relationships Lots of cheating on their partners who didnt work there too sadly but very common *Side note funny enough the ONLY super clean cut person I can think of that wasnt like this was our General Manager who was apparently Mormon and he was from the Philippines and he was a huge family guy Honestly I really liked him a lot* * Lots of the women that hang out at the bars at the hotel particularly the one by the main outdoor patio are regulars trying to score a wealthy target I pretty much recognized all of them varied in age range from 20s to 50s They were local women Some would have memberships at the golf club which was several thousands a year like 12k a year back then I think but the local golfers basically all knew them so they would shift to the resort bars with the new faces No joke several of them were straight-up hot 10/10 chicks and they would almost always be there during baseball spring training season because youd just sit in the lobby and bump into players Management was ok with this because they were attractive Seriously if you were ugly and trying to become a regular management would tell you that if you werent a guest or visiting with someone they shouldnt be there unless they were dining in the restaurant It was really just a subtle way to push them out Theyd look the other way for attractive women It wasnt a guy thing either it was an aesthetics thing Our front desk manager and main restaurant manager were both women as was my concierge manager * Hotel workers hooked up with customers more than you would think The cocktail waitresses were actually kind of famous in our hotel for working the live music weekend shift til 11pm yet for some reason youd see them pulling out of the parking lot in the morning as you came in to work lol Of note employees were not at all allowed to hang out on hotel premises unless it was your day off and you were dining in one of the restaurants only * No one was impressed by your wealth because people were desensitized to it * Pay was mostly crap for hotel workers The only people that make any money in it are the lifers trying to make a career in hotel management They all start at the front desk and work their way up * Seasonal work was done by cheap labor flown in from the Philippines for peak capacity times They all lived in paid housing at apartments off site They rarely interacted with your local American employees and were basically just the help There was a serious issue here with hiring local people however as you go from 100% capacity for 4 months down to 10% capacity for the next 3 months or so you cant keep 700 employees on staff no matter what prices you are charging These people were mostly kept behind the scenes It kind of felt weird to me when I worked there but it wasnt all bad Our general manager was actually a native dude from the Philippines that had worked his way to being a top professional and businessman and was quite fluent in English The language issue was actually a serious barrier for much of the low wage help * I saw someone mentioned prostitution but I honestly didnt see much of that at all as you can probably kind of tell or start to recognize repeat faces We were trained to look for sex trafficking victims however The whole time I was there there was never a single case reported My guess is they probably dont go to as pricey hotels * Drugs are found all of the time from cleaning the rooms It was never reported just "thrown" away if the customer had already checked out Or if the guest was still a resident they were instructed to leave it where they found it and to skip cleaning the room but not to do anything about it Customers would leave drugs all the time out on the table for all to see * Employees hated teachers I hate saying this because I love and respect teachers but at least at our hotel the WORST conference a year we all had to look forward to was the teachers conferences that would come from these California school districts paying absurd amounts of taxpayer money to hold it at a luxury resort in Arizona I dont know what it is but many of the teachers would get absolutely power trippy on the employees demand absurd things or would just be outright mean like they were trying to overcompensate and show that they belonged by being assertive not realizing that the most wealthy people usually dont feel the need to prove anything About the only group despised more than the teachers were the female celebrities There were a couple of ones that were super friendly and but apparently the whole thing about movie star celebrities having an entourage of people around them is real and some of them are straight up DIVAs with crazy requests including demands for things like no employee is allowed to look at them I wish I was joking For some reason I never met a male celebrity that was a total dick They were actually pretty chill for the most part Definitely not high-demand divas Well there is one exception actually now that I think about it A comedian/former tv star was kind of a dick I probably wont name names here Baseball players sports guys were almost always pretty chill Baseball player wives were often also pretty chill but also often crazy Divas themselves I did meet Tiger Woods and his "ex" wife back then and let me tell you amazing dude His wife then was like 11/10 hot scale in person and absolutely one of the friendliest "famous" guests we had PGA tour in February youd get the golf pros *On a final side note as a guy I always thought it was weird how many women basically live vicariously through their husbands What I mean by that is here I am as a concierge giving advice on restaurants and making reservations and so on and a woman will come up with a girlfriend or something and it will be like "Do you know a good Italian restaurant around here? *My surgeon husband* loves Italian food" Like somehow I needed that information to make your reservation at the restaurant or book your mountain biking* Anyway nothing really dark and seedy and secret goes on behind the scenes honestly aside from the fact that people are getting royally ripped off lol The profit margins in these hotels are INSANE I suspect some hotels might have different cultures of course,GeneticsGuy,16226220940,9
h0ajoky,nq9fjc,I know that they have hidden cameras on palm trees and theres no place for you to hide from them And a friend of mine working in this business told me that a lot of people die in hotels I know a person whose father got drunk and fell from the 4th floor balcony right on the restaurants table He died right away I know a woman who swam to a nearby island and stayed there for a couple of days to make her husband worry They were looking for her in the sea and when she returned she had to pay a lot of money for this,APlaceForUsToDream,16226231400,7
h0b0q8c,nq9fjc,I worked at one that used to be 5 stars Im talking about them being 5 stars in the late 70s early 80s KISS actually stayed and performed there while on tour once and they refused to let that go The location had an on site bowling alley 2 bars convention center reception hall 27 hole golf course 2 separate restaurants spa a dock on a nearby lake where they did boating water skiing and fishing expeditions a private beach on the lake and concert venue The place changed hands several times and most of the owners were good at maintaining the property and keeping things up to date until they decided to retire Before long the resort hotel ended up in one of those families where they wouldnt pay the taxes on the income it made and when the IRS came round they would use some loophole to transfer ownership of the resort to a family member who didnt owe anything so the IRS could chain the doors The owners decided that the spa was to expensive to maintain and so shut it all down including both the indoor and outdoor pools the sauna the Jacuzzis attached to the pools and the onsite gym The fired all the staff and sold off the massage beds gym equipment poolside furniture and other related items to make a quick buck They got an offer on the golf course and so sold it off firing a lot of employees in the process The problem was that the concert venue was on the other side of the golf course and they werent allowed to have people using the golf courses parking lot to get to the concerts so they just stopped using it and so it just sat and rotted Again they fired all the technicians who worked it The decided to make the convention center smaller to make it cheaper to maintain and so they remodeled and tore down around 80% of the building ironically making it to small to hold any conventions People stopped renting the now way to small of a place and so they just locked the doors and reduced staff since it wasnt needing cleaned and maintained as much They shut down both restaurants because of cost and fired the entire staff of both locations and started closing the bars down at 7PM most nights and would only open one if they knew there was going to be at least $100 over operating cost of opening the bar made Guest would come out of there rooms at 9PM for a nightcap and find the bar closed and locked The sold of the reception hall to another company that booked weddings bar mitzvahs and birthdays etc and fired the entire staff from there as well And they sold the docks beach and all the associated equipment to a competing tourism company firing the staff from there as well And then they closed off the bowling alley to the public and guest Due to the cost of maintaining the bowling alley they decided to fire all but one guy who was expected to do everything and only open it if a party was booked ahead of time And the rules to book made no sense Minimum was 50 people with a booking fee of $5000 for 3-4 hours of bowling Thats $100 a person Whos gonna pay $100 for what 2 or 3 rounds of bowling And that only covered your shoe and lane rentals I did NOT cover the cost of food or drinks Meanwhile elsewhere in town you could get 3 rounds in with shoe and lane rental for $20 So yeah once they made that decision that place was basically never re-opened The place went from a 5 star hotel with all sorts of on site amenities employing over 300 people to a roadside motel with a massive and empty parking lot employing just over 20 people The weird thing was that they still advertised on the hotel website the spa restaurants bowling bars pools golf course and all the other stuff They had to give out so many refunds when people arrived and found that the hotel didnt actually have those things anymore This was somehow blamed on the remaining staff who they began to lay off To replace these much needed people they would hire their friends but instead of offering the new employees actual pay the owners would give them a room to live in Basically heres your pay minus rent for your room After replacing nearly the entire staff the owners officially closed off an entire wing so the staff could live there Which was illegal at the time and any time an inspection came through the employees would have to pack their belongings and leave They would also open the bar for these people at like 1 or 2 AM so they could have loud parties disturbing the actual guest With the employees living on site the lack of actual amenities and the false advertising it wasnt long until the hotel had a bad reputation This meant that we had to lower cost $45 a night cash And eventually lowered again to $30 cash and then $25 cash Needless to say the hotel became known as the place you go for a cheap room for prostitution affairs drug deals runaways riotous parties drug fuel benders the production of porn There was even a case where a guy was caught using the cheap rooms to make child pornography with his 9 and 12 year old daughters I was eventually the only one on staff left over from the hotels glory days and since I didnt live on site I had to actually be paid The new owners insisted on paying me under the table And I wouldnt leave at the end of each shift until Id gotten my pay because I didnt trust them So naturally in an effort to cut cost they really wanted to fire me but couldnt as none of their friends would work as the night porter That would cut into their drinking at the bar at 2AM Then one day one of our more loyal 2-hours-at-a-time customers asked for the hair dryer in her room be replaced as it wasnt working I called down to house-keeping and informed them of the request and room number and they said theyd get on it Instead they sat in the breakroom smoking pot The customer complained and I was terminated I got a part time job moving furniture a few days later Less than a week later the owners told all the employees that an inspection was coming so they packed up and left The inspection found bed bugs and so the owners responded by packing anything of value into a moving truck putting chains on the door and turning off the power Apparently it was cheaper and easier to shut down then it was to fumigate Everyone left working there suddenly found themselves jobless and homeless And then it came out that the owners had embezzled over 10 million dollars from the hotel and thats why suddenly everything was too expensive to maintain and needed sold off Money they also pocketed,ThorsHammer0999,16226367170,8
h0b1yvn,nq9fjc,Personally have not worked for one But a few friends have and have told me some stories I have delivered interesting medication to concierges of these 5\* hotels for some of the guests however but anyways back to the friends They worked in some of the crme de la crme hotels in London Regular stories of coke and escorts of which many requests came from Arab Royalty But 2 that have particularly stood out to me One was a request from a well known international celebrity who requested vegan food which has fallen from a tree naturally like an extreme version of a raw-food vegan but with bruised and battered fruits Had to contact farms out of the city to try and get hold of it It was entertaining The other one was a scum (rich scum at that) who tried to rape my friend in the lift Out of no where started to try and pull her clothes off Luckily she was able to kick him out as door of lift opened Management dealt with the guest swiftly and told him to never set foot in the hotel again The guest was a regular for the past 10-12 years so kudos to them for putting morals above money,theeaglekid,16226374640,4

Sometimes it sits by a service elevator for weeks because the maid wanted to go home and forgot about it When I first started at a hotel someone left a half eaten plate of food on a cart for a whole month It turned black then green then to a pile of dust Cockroachs are everywhere They spray every few months in guest areas to keep them out but that just pushes them to service areas I literally had a cockroach waiving to me from inside our staff salad bar last time they sprayed Everything is expensive because they are greedy they might make you think its expensive so they can keep paying staff when its slow but no they just stop scheduling people Most the staff work at other hotels to make more money to save up for the slow times The only reason I see them needing that much money is because they do have more staff to pay compared to a cheap hotel As a vendor inside the hotel youre forced to charge 4-5 times normal prices because the hotel wants 75% of the cut My company is inside a ton of hotels and we charge you the same amount of money it would cost to buy something brand new just to rent it for 1 day A lot of people do end up buying the stuff from a normal store and throwing it away as a fuck you to the hotel We do give discounts for some clients but we have to get hotel approval Or the hotel forces us to give a discount We have one client who we make no money on because the hotel wants to make them happy They are the worst clients Snobby rich snap their fingers and do my bidding type Its supposedly some charity event but none of the people are very charitable and it makes about as much money as it would actually cost to throw the event So you pay more for your wedding to pay for some rich snobs to feel good about themselves,0RGASMIK,16226477320,2

h8nckqj,p2u3fe,Let me tell you about the bet my cousin offered me yesterday So gonna save win 500 cause he is stupid and for some reason he forgot it The bet is trump is going to be president before 2024 In general what he says is that they are counting the votes better still counting the votes and They found out that many votes for Biden were fake So I just summarized it for him and thought he would understand how stupid his bet proposal is: Told him: so you are actually saying that the current president Biden will loose his job as president cause of fake votes and Trump is going to be reinstated as president again before 2024 His answer: YES Btw he was also 100% sure that trump is going to win the election last year I mean to be president 2021 again and as you see that was a no money bet he lost Cause my little cousin also agrees with him and was the reason why his first 200 bet proposal increased to 500 I suggest that they should split it and he should come up with half of the money in case he is loosing So he agreed to it FYI we all live in Germany i consider both of my cousins not really smart Both anti-vaxx But hey I tried my best to convince him and teach him about vaccination last year and it still didnt work Now he offers me free money and i told him I will accept the bet maybe he is going to learn and understand if he looses money,somniator_,16287723110,1

h44y75q,oe5uja,Accidentally overdosing on a drug and ending up in the hospital I reached out and messaged those friends that said "Message me if you need anything!" And when I asked them to do something like feed my cat check the mail message my family who dont use internet or just talk to me the response was "**Let me know if you need anything!" It was as though saying that somehow ignored what I was telling them I need I learned people say this when they dont know what to say or dont want to actually do something** Like here I am in a hospital bed asking you for that help you said I could ask for I know that Ive helped you but now that I just need this rudimentary help while Im being treated at the hospital no one is there Not even family Ive gone out and visited friends hosted events for them helped them in many ways and it can be for years And yet if I ask to be visited or for help theres nothing Sometimes they wont even let me know they cant show up for things like my birthday until hours into the party starting time Some people just want to "piggybank" you dropping figurative social coins into you so that you show up for them but they may never show up for you Ive spent years talking to someone wondering what it would take for them to ever fucking visit me to have them literally show up once in over 5 years of a friendship **I feel like an idiot for having invested so much of myself time money and genuine love to realize they do not want to invest even a fraction in reciprocation** "Were friends for life now" some have said to me and weve shared deep things But its always in public chat groups and we never converse in private Ive learned some people know how to be emphatic and seem really caring but often it seems all they really care about is a performative friendship: the sing and dance of a friendship but when you genuinely want to talk and open up about a conflict to really ask for help to work through something its not what theyre there for **Theyre there for the superficial and entertaining the positive only and the negative - whatever it may be - is not what they are there for** I dont know anymore what a real friendship is Im left really wondering if Im the problem The proverb "if everyone is the problem then its you" rings in my head: I must be the problem because every relationship has similar issues: **lack of genuine connection** If I start to open up and share genuine feelings its a burden And most of the time Im just asking to be heard nothing more and I really only do this when it feels like it could be accepted Im not opening up relationships like this You have to wait till rapport feels like its acceptable to be vulnerable and authentic But even when you do theres the risk that youre not compatible Or maybe Im completely wrong and I have a massive issue I need to address that Im just not seeing Ive been in therapy for a while and my consistent issue is that Im emotionally confused about my own self So tl;dr I dont fucking know,onus111,16254992330,84

h47c4lc,oe5uja,When I was always congratulating my "friends" on their achievements and wouldnt ever be acknowledged for my achievements and I was always expected to sacrifice my relationships and even bail on holidays anniversaries etc for my "friends" but then when they got into a relationship I wouldnt hear from them till it ended or if we did hangout theyd dip out at the drop of a hat for their girlfriend I lost quite a few really great girlfriends because of that It happened 4-5 times before I said fuck this Their thing was always saying I was "pussy whipped" or a "bad friend" if I didnt ditch my girlfriends for them But then they never once made the same sacrifices I grew up with those "friends" 3rd-4th grade to 23ish I did anything and everything for them gave them money when they needed it even give them my clothes shit even my last cigarette if they asked and I never asked or expected anything in return but the last straw for me was when they started talking shit about me behind my back and one "fun" drunk night one of them flat out said to my face that he hated the thought of me doing better in life then him and he hated how I always seemed happy and hated how easy it was for me to get girlfriends then a few minutes later he proceeded to message a girl on Facebook that I was dating at the time and told her I was cheating on her and was out with another girl all while I was sitting in front of him with our other guy friends (I had no idea what he was doing on his phone at that moment) then he kept trying to tell her and convince her to just cut me off and block me and go meet up with him and stay over at his place told her how hed always liked her and that hed treat her better and blah blah he was talking out his ass just cause he wanted to fuck her well she ended up calling me first and the second my phone went off he gave me the most coldest angry stare Ive ever gotten in my life but anyway she was crying asking me if I was cheating I wasnt so I said what are you talking about? and at this point my "friend" got up and said he was going to leave and was trying to leave quickly but another "friend" wasnt letting him leave cause he still wanted to kick it she started telling me he had messaged her told her I was cheating then tried getting her to just cut me off without saying anything to me and go to his house to stay the night and as she was telling me this I looked over at him and he looked at me so fearful like he knew what was happening he got so pale trembly voice was telling the other friend he was going to puke and to get out of his way so he could go outside well I dropped my phone (and let me say this first Im not a violent person at all unless I get put in a situation where I feel I have no other option) but anyway I dropped my phone and for about 3 to 4 seconds that seemed to feel like an eternity I was standing there cycling through my mind everything and how wrong he had just tried to do me How betrayed I felt on top of the comments he had made earlier to me I was in this weird situation where my brain was telling me to just tell him our friendship is over and Im cutting him off But my heart and body felt so sick like a way worse gut feeling that you get when you find out your girlfriend is cheating I felt so backstabbed and angry that I lashed out and hit him probably 12-13 times He was trying to cover up but The 3rd punch I threw was a clean connection on his temple (he was covering his face) his legs gave out and he slumped against the corner of the wall and the front door making a weird snorting sound the other punches were while he was already knocked out and I was just screaming things at him and crying for whatever reason while hitting him I was in such a emotional sickly rage and the 12th or 13th hit I cant remember the number exactly it was when I kicked his face and his head made a hole in the dry wall then I backed up still screaming shaking and crying I was so mad But then guilt overwhelmed me I felt horrible immediately after and I was shaking uncontrollably the other 3 "friends" that were there were just standing there not looking me in the face they told me to leave so I grabbed my phone and left When I got home I was fully expecting cops to show up saying I killed him or gave him horrible brain trauma or that I was getting assault charges but he recovered fine apparently his face got swelled up pretty bad for awhile and I broke 4 teeth when I kicked his face but I havent talked to him since or the other "friends" I went to anger management a few weeks after it happened and the way it was explained to me was that outburst I had was a result of shit building and building up inside like a soda bottle under immense pressure and a bunch of other emotional issues from being taken advantage of treated like shit etc and I was pretty much walking around with it all buried deep down and that night mixed with alcohol resulted in a trigger for it and I lost complete control because I grew up with him and trusted him completely and it hurt like hell and to be done so dirty I felt emotions I never want to feel again So I continue to see and talk to people for anger management I got into new hobbies I never thought I would lol like boxing hitting heavy bags lifting weights etc and I absolutely love football and those things help me blow off steam so now I dont have any sort of built up emotional issues I havent had any problems since And the thing that sucks above all was my closest friend the only real friend I ever actually had that was never negative or shitty or deceptive towards me died in a car accident when we were both 20 So yeah if you ask me friends are overrated and theyll disappear anyway when either of you get married and have kids Sorry for the long ass story this topic/question just made me think of all that,DakGoatScott,16255452570,4

hbm50b6,oe5uja,I was the only one at the time who had a car and was able to drive it from home to school and back and to my part-time job at the local mall if I had a shift after school Had a decent group of friends and they were all great people with similar interests and they were just all around the weird goofy people I needed (I was really shy and didnt talk much to strangers and still dont) to get out of my shell My job also helped(only thing I think that was good about that job) I remember my "friend" lets call her "June" asking me if I could give her a ride home earlier in the day I said "no problem" and we parted ways to go to our next period This was a pretty normal occurrence throughout my junior and senior years of high school I didnt mind giving her rides as she would pay me in food (I didnt eat lunch at school; never brought money to pay for it and never bothered to ask my parents to put money into the account) or drinks and sometimes she would actually give me cash but it was rare Now she had her own vehicle but she didnt like to drive it because it wasnt a nice car (2000s-ish Honda) and it needed some work done to it to actually run correctly I had no problems with this since she didnt live that far from me and we were pretty close friends Any-who I was waiting in my car when she hopped in the passenger side and we left about a minute or so later We get to the top of her driveway and I stop and ask what shes going to be doing if anything She tells me "probably going to hang out with Kayla and watch movies or go to the mall" Oh Okay thats cool This was the moment I realized I was just a chauffeur to pick her up and bring her home After Ive given you all of these rides a good handful of them FREE! Yes she got me food but that only kept me from being hungry and not actually put gas in my tank and I was too nice of a person at the time to tell anyone NO Im probably being too petty but when she got out of the car and I was driving home all I felt was used the entire way home It was so long ago that I dont remember if we actually had an argument over it or not (she was the type of girl to get mad at me over the dumbest s*** and not talk to me for 2 weeks and then apologize and go back like it never even happened) but she rode the bus after that and I gave her rides whenever her better friend couldnt come get her Currently dont talk to her but have her in my "friends" on social media Really only stay in touch with 1 person out of my friend group from high school,USS-Demon,16307906840,3

h45ho97,oe5uja,When my main best friend had shown me his manipulative conniving and petty tendencies Im going to give you some background as to who this guy is Lets call him J Now J was your average high school age boy into skating video games and rap music He was also *very* thirsty for any kind of sexual activities This is when I first noticed what he was: *a pathological liar* He claimed to have been with 25+ girls at the age of 16 Okay not impossible but surely improbable This was only the first of his lies hes lied about me to so many people J lied to my friend Z who was coming in from out of town Z Wanted me to meet up with them as seeing Z was a rare occurrence J then told me that I didnt want to come and instead I was never told anything I was only notified when Z texted me later that night asking why I bailed on them Heres where the fun begins It turns out J lied about *EVERYTHING* He started dating a girl: U U wasnt the greatest of her peers Coincidentally like J she lied about a lot of things too Dont worry well get there As soon as J got together with U J became a raging liar Im going to list off the things that were so outlandish that they couldnt have been true - He now has a new fear of water which I was never made aware of even AFTER we went to the beach together He never brought it up once And his "fear" is to the point where he cant even look at water So why did he come to the beach? Why didnt he say anything? Why does his story about how he developed this fear keep fluctuating? - He apparently went into a nearby city (not trying to doxx myself) to go participate in BLM riots What could possibly be wrong about this? Hes 16 apparently brought back a can of tear gas rode in on his bike (which is about a 9hr ride) and I literally saw him 3hr before he was allegedly there (I hate bringing up this next point because Im not one to bring peoples financial/familial state into argument but it must be done for this ) - He claims to have gone to Japan for a week when he was younger Okay whats so wrong about this? His mother has cancer (which I found out when I was talking to a friend who he pawns his homework off to And cited that as a reason he couldnt do it) and his father isnt in the picture So theyre not in the best financial situation But Js telling me that he bought a passport round trip plane tickets for 2 a week of hotels and food expenses and then tourist attractions while being in that financial state? Either hes lying to me which seems very likely or theyre not very good with money management - J also claimed that hes been in multiple street fights as a 16 year old in a town where *nothing* happens And those are only the ones I can remember Now we get to the real good part why did you two stop being friends? Remember when I said U was also a liar? Now we get to see that Keep in mind this next portion is an excerpt from a conversation with that homework friend J had on this subject with some changes like names *WARNING: THE FOLLOWING CONTENT CONTAINS EXPLICIT MATERIAL ABOUT THE TOPIC OF SUICIDE READ AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION* So basically it was four people J Js gf U our mutual friend H and myself H had started to develop feelings for me and kissed me twice while I was in my relationship with E I didnt protest it because 1 I didnt care and 2 E and I were more open in our relationship (basically meaning as long as we didnt start another romantic relationship or had sex with another person we were fine) [Extra clarification E and I were long distance which is why we set those rules in place] J and U saw this as me cheating on E (even though H only kissed me on the cheek) They then started to spread rumors to those who were friends with the four of us and that started turmoil between the group Then on an unrelated note I cut myself because its used as a coping mechanism and I wanted to see if it would help me (it didnt and I dont want to do it again) J U and H all boasted about how they did it so when I did it I lied to them about the reason because it was very personal U then cut herself again and claimed that it was my fault because I was talking about me doing it H said that it wasnt my fault because they were talking about it the day of and that didnt cause anything So all of this is relayed to M [a mutual friend of me and J] skewed beyond belief because the four of us have somewhat split H and I take one side while U and J take the other Since J is the only one talking to M at the time he is able to lie about what happened and claimed that I said "so what? She wouldve relapsed anyway" which was never said In fact I apologized to U after the ordeal but that didnt seem to change anything And with only getting information from that one source he decided to end the friendship So now if I see J U or M around town they shun me and dont speak of my existence Ive tried to keep people that arent with this grouping of 5 (J U H M and myself) neutral but I dont know how well thats going PS sorry thats so goddamn long I had to get it off my chest,GalaxyNinja87,16255090770,2
h45myh9,oe5uja,Pretty much what other people are saying In high school I had your typical fake friends who made plans with each other right in front of me without even acknowledging my existence I was always the one to reach out and if I was lucky they would respond with excuses as to why they couldnt hang out They used me when it was convenient for them like helping them with their homework and then as soon as I did they just vanished They made fun of me a lot usually about my appearance and sometimes my nationality Which strikes me as odd because I took good care of myself back then and was in great shape so not much to make fun of I remember one time in senior year one of them got the entire class including the teacher to laugh at me for being a virgin Real funny jokes you got there Greg We graduated three years ago and I havent heard from anyone since I moved away for University and I made one friend my freshman year who I thought could turn out to be an amazing friend but nope He suddenly drops out and confesses his love for me one night over text when he was drinking (I am a guy) Said he wanted to do "things" to me and I told him off for making me feel like I had a friend and then just vanishing into thin air and ghosting me (I had tried to get a hold of him for a while afterward I was worried something happened to him) And for being a fucking creep that isnt something normal people text as far as I am aware I think he just wanted a fuck buddy and never gave a shit about me I didnt care if he was bi or whatever I just got mad because aside from him I had no one else talk to or hang out with and this particular event really made me start to distrust people It made me realize that people can be an entirely different person on the inside and you wont know their true colors until they choose reveal it or in dire situations This was in 2019 for context Havent heard or spoken to him since I am 20 now will be 21 in two weeks and not only do I have zero friends I just quit my job last month because Im just fed up Everyday I wake up depressed and angry and bitter Just seems like everyone is fake idk maybe I just have to try harder and meet more people I was able to make "friends" at my work we got along great and all but it never evolved into anything more than a work/professional/casually friendly relationship And school of course has been online for the past year and a half because of covid so theres that I know this isnt as serious or impactful as other posts on here but just wanted to share because no one else knows any of this and how I feel I think genuine friends are very important to a persons mental health at least for people like me who cant stand feeling lonely This is also of course just one persons experience so dont take what I say as fact its just my mindset right now given what I have personally seen and experienced,chris_get_the_money,16255117490,2

h45tsou,oe5uja,I had this best friend and I just thought she personally loved taking photos with friends and posting them on social media I also thought she was just super encouraging as she would always tell me in person and post on social media all these flattering compliments Any time I went out with her (which was always her choice of some posh location This annoyed me sometimes as I like low-key stuff like just talking over coffee but she was really nice and so I just went with the flow) she had to take a photo and post it I like clothes and fashion so Whenever we would go out to her preferred location I would dress up (because of course it was fancy) and she would go on and on about how "cool" I looked and then would insist on a photo together which she would immediately post to social media There were some red flags there but again she had been nothing but nice to me for years so I just tried to assume the best Then I was diagnosed with anorexia And as I entered recovery I was struggling with so much depression and shame I was putting on weight fast (getting kinda overweight) and didnt have any fashionable clothes that fit me (I didnt have the money to buy new clothes yet) I was just wearing t-shirts and yoga pants I didnt feel like going out to fancy restaurants etc either because obviously I only had t-shirts and again I was dealing with tons of depression and shame around the eating disorder and my rapidly changing body Anyway I had told her about my diagnosis and about going into recovery and she never really said anything about it Like nothing This person who had been so encouraging and nice had nothing encouraging or nice to say That is kinda shitty I thought But I tried to assume she just didnt know what to say in the situation again trying to assume the best But then She started noticeably avoiding me Whenever I did see her (after I would reach out to her and ask to hang out) she had changed totally towards me She stopped saying anything complimentary or encouraging Id catch her looking me up and down in a weird way as if assessing meand of course the photos she just had to take any time we got together stopped Oh and even more telling? When Id ask her hang out she suddenly didnt want to go out any more She wanted to just meet at her house Even her attitude towards me had changed She seemed bored or annoyed with me and just focused on talking about herself or more precisely her new friend Crystal She kept bragging about "cool" Crystal was She showed me photos of Crystal from Crystals Facebook and Instagram talking about how pretty and fashionable she was Then she showed me all the photos of her and crystal dressed up at trendy locals Soon after she just stopped talking to me altogether I realized that flattery is not the same as encouragement that being complimentary is not the same as being nice and that maybe a real friend shouldnt be obsessed with how cool they think you are Im still overweight and wearing t-shirts but I have started making new friends These friends dont flatter me with compliments They dont tell me Im cool they just talk to me If I feel sad or down they say something simple and encouraging They are cool with just having actual conversation over a cheap cup of coffee They dont feel the need to document every time we get together on social media Moral of the story find people who will always let you be you Who will accept you in good times AND bad Who arent drinking your koolaid and can tell you when youre being a jerk or need to improve Those just might be actual friends,linconnuedelaseine,16255152200,2

h45wd18,oe5uja,My bachelor party On several occasions prior to that night I told them all under no circumstances did I want to go to a strip club For one theyre just not my scene Id been to several in the past and I just never enjoyed myself Secondly my wife-to-be had a previous marriage with someone who cheated on her several times and had developed trust issues and when the guys brought the idea up with her she was clearly uncomfortable with it Cut to the night of my bachelor party and my groomsmen and me all went drinking and were having a good time We stopped and ate some fancy food and everyone was clearly a little bored of the area of town we were on and we decided to move on I thought wed go to another part of town known for its collection of bars but during the car ride I saw they put a strip club in the gps I reiterated that I absolutely do NOT want to go to a strip club yet they persisted saying my fianc "gave them permission" I repeated myself adding that I didnt care if they got permission from her they didnt get it from me We get to the club and they drag me by my arms into the place and the entire time Im there Im giving death glares to each of my groomsmen I declined dances as politely as I could and eventually my best man walks up to a couple dancers and gives them money They dancers come up to me and offer to dance to which I decline except instead of leaving they too persist to the point of accusing me of being gay for declining while the guys laughed It is at this point I slam my fist on the table and walk out On the ride home the gang proceeds to tell me Im an ungrateful bitch and that Im the reason we couldnt have a good time When we got back to my place I got out of the car and told them that none of them are invited to the wedding and I had better not see any of them there Its been two years and I havent seen any of them since They were my entire core group of friends and it was like the worst break up imaginable These guys who I had been best friends with for 12 or 13 years and I couldnt trust any of them anymore I still struggle sometimes since I dont really have fully fledged friends anymore I have acquaintances but those were my **friends** so I thought,Slimer220,16255165240,2

h46979w,oe5uja,Ive written about this before in another post but here goes againwording may vary slightly with the retelling I had "friends" who would only invite me places when they needed someone else to chip in money Like a late invite to a concert because one person pulled out last minute (though the amount I paid for tickets always seemed to cost more than market price?) And this happened ALOT! Im talking for 12 months I just put up with the mistreatment thinking this was normal behaviour Ive never had real friends before so I didnt know any better Mind you I never got invited anywhere I wasnt expected to pay for things Like a house party where I had to buy the alcohol etc Anyway I got a late invite to a movie then we were going to dinner afterwards Once the movie was over one girl (ringleader so to speak) said "oh wait Were one space short in our cars I guess *someone* should stay behind" Cue EVERYONE looking at me (around 9 other girls) No joke I was humiliated It was like it was planned from the start Im like SERIOUSLY?!?! This is what you think of me?!?! Surely I deserved better than this? I rolled my eyes said fuck it Im done with this shit called my mum to come get me (I was 18 we were poor and had one car so I couldnt take it for the day) and never had anything to do with them again Mum was furious but I told her its OK If they didnt do this I wouldnt have seen them for what they were and cut them out I worked with them too So they started their shit again the very next week like "we have one spare ticket if you wanna come? You know you do!" "No thanks and you should probably stop asking me from now on coz Im done with you" Petty but I felt like they should know what it feels like to be tossed away like garbage too Cue nasty rumours mysteriously circulating the store most no-one believed because they were adults and ACTUALLY ASKED ME ABOUT THEM and I set them straight But I was free and it felt AMAZING!

h48tc61,oe5uja,A little background: my family has a business that I was able to work and make money at when I was a kid I was *always* the only one with money Money that I spent my Saturdays and 3 hours after school working to make So when I was 15 my "best friend" called me one morning crying and freaking out telling me she had sex last night and she that she might be pregnant and that she needs $60 for Plan B She was nearly hysterical So being the good friend that I was I met her that morning loaned her the money and she was going to go with the guy she had sex with to get Plan B at Planned Parenthood I didnt hear anything from her for the rest of the day The next day I got ahold of her asked her if shes ok and if she was able to get Plan B she proceeds to tell me that the guy she was with reassured her that there was no way she couldve gotten pregnant They used a condom it didnt break everything was protected she didnt need Plan B etc So instead of giving me back my $60 that day like a good friend should do she took my $60 bought some weed and smoked it with that guy! Fucking weed!! What a bitch She never paid me back Fuck you Sarah; you asshat That was a shit decision,BeautifulEscape3101,16255841930,2

h49q4d9,oe5uja,Holy crap Ive had all too many of these moments Im so thick - or perhaps a nicer way to think of it as is that I view people charitably - that these things basically need to be spelled out for me before I realize them I My supposed best (and really only) friend from elementary school started hanging out with a pack of kids in middle school who got their kicks by bullying me My friend didnt exactly join in but never stood up for me either Well I was a lonely kid with a lot of trauma so I hung out with them even though they made me absolutely miserable about myself and my life - I must have figured in some pre-conscious way that it was better to be a part of \*some\* group than \*no\* group At least that way I had people I could sit with at lunch right? Fast forward to high school where I actually made some real friends and was getting praise for my intellect and efforts from teachers in class and so was able to develop a smidge of self-esteem I was still friends with my buddy from elementary school or at least thought I was until one day I went to their house after school and after some conversation about a movie or the weather or whatever they suddenly got huffy and decided it was a good time to tell me that they had NEVER liked me and that they had only been my friend for the last 9 years because one of our elementary school teachers had told them to befriend the lonely new kid who had just moved to town which was then also encouraged by their parents Gotta say even today this still smarts II Group of people I hung out with freshman year of college I found out at the end of the year (when one group member confessed) that the group had distanced themselves from me because this one girl -who I hardly hung out with and who was not a central figure of the group - told a pack of crazy lies about me I only found out because she apparently had a meltdown - possibly a true psychotic break - near the end of the year and things she said and did apparently cued folks in to the fact that maybe she wasnt so reliable of a narrator to begin with I never found out what the lies were specifically just that she made me out to be a monster and that caused folks to keep me at the periphery of the group Well by then the rift had already happened even if I hadnt been fully conscious of it and I realized I didnt want to make a big effort to get back in with a group of folks who would (a) so easily believe lies about me and (b) not attempt to verify the lies or give me a chance to refute them III I dont want to get too deep into this one because it remains a deep wound in my psyche but at one point a group of folks I was hanging out with & going festival hopping with all needed to borrow money for various reasons I had the means at the time and so helped out Another person outside of the group whom the group hated\* but who was an important character in the larger sphere of that festival circuit crowd told them that I was a persona non grata at the event that they were throwing I was thus uninvited from that event and the group used the opportunity to cut me out of their circle completely conveniently providing them with an excuse to never pay me back I lost something like 3 grand I think? A lot for me at the time - still a lot even now It took me more than 6 months of processing the experience to realize that I had been used and that they had never truly cared about me and had only been as nice as they needed to be to get money and other favors from me They talked a big game about being more than friends - about being a family - and I had wanted to believe it so hard because I had just gotten out of an insanely abusive relationship and lost my housing and was just puttering about the world completely rudderless and felt friendless and alone The saddest part though is the *time* I had wasted in their company that would have been better spent with the many people in my life who were actually real friends who were friends before then and are friends now Basically trauma prevented me from seeing the people who had quietly stuck by me as my friends \*Hated for good reason; without saying too much but he was (and likely still is) a real lowlife POS He hated me because I was apparently the only person in the world who told him that to his face - everyone else just thought it and talked about it behind his back IV There have been other moments normally with individuals and not groups where I slowly and eventually realized that they werent a good or real friend But the above examples are the most outrageous Moral(s) of the story? Value yourself and your time; dont hang out with people who make you feel like shit; dont hang out with people who hang out with people who make you feel like shit; dont tell people you barely know how much disposable income you have; real friendship isnt always - or even usually - loud & flashy but instead solid quiet comforting and enduring Oh and this is critical get into therapy for your trauma so you can learn to distinguish shit from Shinola,Grunkle_Sticky,16255989590,2

hc10quk,oe5uja,First day of high school I met who was my best friend for like 5 years We were like sisters she was quite often at my house and I was often at hers I met everyone in her family also went there for Christmas one year It was simply the best friendship Ive ever had One day I started to notice that during the years there were some "white" lies like her saying she got a number from a boy but months later I found out it was her classroom mates or her having flirts with people who actually didnt exist Also some money disappeared from my home Were talking about 10/20 but its the principle So during the period I was finally in a relationship with this really hot guy she started to be so mean to me Probably she was jealous The day I realize our friendship was over was during one of our walks where I noticed she really didnt want to hang out with me I saw this couple and the guy was very handsome I told her something like "look that guy is freaking hot!" and she said "yeah but have you seen her? Shes disgusting" I told her than I didnt even notice her she was cute and she told me touching my shoulders "Yes because you know what it feels like to be the ugly one in a couple" It was over I almost cried The past two months were tense because I actually confronted her with her lies but this thing mixed with all the little cruel things she said about me and my relationship really made me realize that we changed I matured I simply wasnt the same and for sure she changed too so we started to think differently shared less things She also started talking behind my back with some other friends I just remove her from all my socials and never spoke to her again She didnt even try to ask me why Im pretty sure she knows the exact reasons Shes still always checking my IG though Sometimes I miss that kind of friendship It was so good until it lasted,dopesmoker96,16310805240,2

h44w118,oe5uja,Ive recently had that happen to me About 7 years ago I was in the darkest part of my life I had just broken up to my girlfriend just lost my mom and I was slowly turning into an alcoholic My best friends of 10 years slowly turned her back on me When my mother passed away she left my brothers and I some small bit of inheritance from her life insurance And a friend of mine (who I stupidly told this to so its my fault on this part) knew about it and asked me if I can lend her about 2k for a new computer At first I said yes because I was honestly naive and really really immature about money so thats another fuck up in my part And when it came close to the time she needs that computer I changed my side and said yes but askedif we could maybe go down a bit on price sit around a thousand to 1100 The reason why I went lower on The Price is because I knew her habits She never finished things through Shed talk about how she wanted a YouTube channel and want to start streaming get back into music and podcasting And looking back at her track record yeah I didnt think that was going to happen anytime soon This is my money Im giving you to do these things so Im kind of hoping shed do what she said she would Hell I even bought her a YouTube class for her to get started and she never even used it so that was another $100 to wasted down the drain So needless to say she was pretty pissed off when I told her I wanted to go lower in price She started screaming at me how I screwed her over and I kept telling her that I still wanted to buy her the computer but not for $2000 By then I was just fed up with it drove over to Micro Center and proceeded to tell them the whole situation And even the helper was like "And you still want to buy this person a computer??" I said yes because its still the principal of the thing and I said that I would do so So they gave me a list for this new build that would still be able to do the things she wanted at 1000 I went back to her with the list and gave her an ultimatum I said "This is the computer that I will buy for you that will still do all the things that you want to do If you say yes to it then we will go to Micro Center right now and buy the damn thing but if you say no then I will rip this up and never speak of this whole situation again what do you choose?" She begrudgingly said yes and I got her the computer After that our friendship between us was broken and was never repaired So the friendship was essentially dead And Ill be honest there was no love lost there now that Im thinking back to it If I really look at how our relationship was as friends I was kind of more like the person you could kick around for them Backhanded compliments shady remarks she was quick to mock me sometimes Dont get me wrong there was good things in our friendship in the beginning but over time it just started turning into toxic Ultimately yes I will own up that I was an asshole and stupid But she was still taking advantage of me Cuz usually if someone still wants to get you the damn computer even if for a lower price would you really still bitch and complain to the person STILL buying you the computer!?

h450lke,oe5uja,I once had a fake friend who was at first really sweet (except that she loved pranks which i now realise were just really unbelievable lies) But one day she came up to me and told me that she didnt have money for lunch that day and asked if I could buy her some So I agreed but told her to bring her own money next time She agrees and I go to buy her lunch The next day it happens again I ask why she didnt bring her own and she said her mom didnt get paid from work until the end of the week so she wouldnt have money for lunch She asked me to pay for the rest of the week Because it was Thursday I agreed The next week it happens again And again And again Her excuses kept getting crazier and crazier She said she had to sell her fridge and all her cabinets were empty So I agreed Again And again And again For context though she has a single mother and two little sister twins but is pretty well off and live in a nice two story house with a pretty spacious backyard Ive been there once before its really nice She even gets her own room separate from her sisters However I live in a small apartment with my mom and my older sibling Theres only two bedrooms and not too much space in the living room but were all fine with that The only reason she asked me to pay is because Im pretty sure she knew how generous my parents were They spoil me and so I get a lot of new things as well as more than enough money for lunch every day (they give me enough for like months so that they dont have to put more money into my school account all the time) She took advantage of this Now it got to the point where I was sick of it One day she comes up to me and says lets go get lunch Not even asking me to pay at this point So I said no But Im physically pretty weak and shes the opposite and guilt tripped me a lot during this time She grabbed me by the arms and kinda pinned them to my sides It didnt look bad to other people passing by but I seriously couldnt move So I caved and said yes and only then would she let me go This happened a couple times with the same results each time and even blocking my way if I tried to ignore her instead My parents when Christmas break arrived looked at my account and saw I was using a lot of money as well as buying foods I would never eat (i guess being a picky eater was finally useful huh?) I told them and they gave me a bit of advice So once we got back to school I unfriended her It was really hard and resulted in refriending and unfriending her once or twice but I finally managed to stay unfriended She actually a couple months ago came up to me while I was waiting for my older sibling after school and told me she was sorry The last time she apologised I had to scream at her through text pointing out every last thing she did to me and even then she said did I? Im sorry if I did! Despite the fact that this went on for 2 or 3 months The apology was pretty shocking to hear and even now she still avoids me and I always see what looks like a guilty look in her eye I dont think shes lying she was never this good an actor but if I ever try to talk to her anymore and let her know Im not that mad anymore (but still dont want to be friends) shell look at me but not say anything and then tell her friend that shes leaving (to which said friend always follows) Her friends are really sweet actually but I just hope they dont go through what I did Probably not but theres always that chance,DuBistSehrDoof,16255004420,1

h8w548q,p3w5k9,So when I younger my dad died My mom remarried and had two kids I was moved into the basement Unfinished basement I didnt think anything of it since I was 10 I had a sheet blocking my area from the laundry area It had bare concrete walls wood beams and piping across the ceiling and cement flooring Used a heater and dehumidifier cause it was cold and humid When I used the heater my parents would make my sheeted area around my bed so it would heat up the space quicker Parents didnt allow any of my friends over and my brother and sister werent allowed in my room Distant family members also never stayed over and when we had family gathering I was told to go into the guest room instead of my room while they were there I thought cool I have a huge room and no one can mess it up My family would go on vacations yearly without me from when I was 12 till I was 18 I was the dog and house watcher During one of those vacations when I was 17 I invited a friend come over They pointed out how fucked up it was that there were bedrooms fully furnished with TVs for my brother and sister a guest room fully furnished as well with a tv and how I was in the basement with sheets for walls and bathroom mats on the floor I completely dismissed it cause it was normal to me It wasnt till I was 20 that I found out that the family trips that I didnt go on were paid for with money that I was getting from my dad passing away Im sure I got some of the money in food and clothes and whatever I needed But its got me pretty fucked up cause my brother and sister dont have any memory of it and when I talk about it they always back my parents by saying we were raised right and I opted out of vacations They also thought the guest room was my room Add-on I just wanted to thank everyone for being so kind and welcoming with your thoughts There is a lot and this whole day has been way more emotional than I could have ever ever expected Im trying my best to get back to everyone and if I miss you it was an honest mistake Again thank you everyone  you all deserve the world Also if any of you need someone to talk to my door is always open After a ton of messages hounding me to add an Amazon wishlist Here it is I added a bunch of expensive stuff that I really do hope no one buys Its list is stuff Im hoping to buy myself in the future https://wwwamazoncom/hz/wishlist/ls/2Q9DSSBO13GJ9?ref_=wl_share,Relative_Economics17,16289329690,13581

h90yi2s,p3w5k9,I was maybe 10 when I went to sleep over at my best friends house Things were normal at first We played games We watched tv We played on her dads work computer It was great! As all good things do the fun ended the moment my friends older brother got home I always thought her brother was so cool because he was maybe 5-ish years older than us My opinion changed rather quickly after this visit At first her brother kept standing behind us while we were sitting on their couch Weird but ok Then he began asking my friend to come into his room My friend kept saying no and rolling her eyes Ok then I tried to ignore this too even thought my little alarm bells were going off (thanks mom for raising me on the Cops TV show) Eventually the brother gave up this tactic and decided to switch it up I guess I remember he first asked my friend if she would come into his room for $10 My friend said no Her brother upped the offer to $15 Again my friend said no so her brother turned to me and offered me the $15 to go to his room My mind was blown $15 seemed like a crap ton of money to my child brain but again my little alarms were still ringing Before I could answer my friend looks me dead in the eye and tells me Ill regret it of I go in her brothers room I was freaked the fuck out Her brother stormed off to his room and I figured maybe that was the last wed see of him for the evening but no that would have been to easy The universe could not have that After my friends mom made us dinner I needed to go to the restroom As I was doing my thing in there I noticed the door knob start to jiggle a little bit Being the innocent child I was I thought someone needed to use the restroom so I yelled that the restroom was occupied That didnt stop the door knob from jiggling thought I was starting to sweat I have no idea how long that went on for but at the time it felt like forever Suddenly I heard shouting from the other side of the door My friends mom went to check on me and saw her son standing in front of the bathroom door Needless to say I called my mom immediately after I came out of the restroom and went home It wasnt until I was older that I happened to remember this Maybe I was over reacting but those two incidents alone freaked me out and I stayed away from my friends house,lunabean134,16290325090,18

I dont know if anything of that sort exists but she NEEDED to take care of others While it sounds kinda lovely of her it was actually her trying to help fellow portuguese immigrants that were doing shit with their finances by lending them money she would never recover \- Also my parents would just bind me to the kitchen chair with a belt if I werent to finish my plate They were also very easy on the physical abuse and everyfuckingtime I said something that was unpleasant to them they would hit me with a wooden spoon on the fingers pull my hair kick my ass or slap me &#x200B; There is a loooot of others things that I dont remember about at the moment but it was mostly daily abuse My memory is kinda messed up too with all of the traumas (no shit) and for the most part I only realized it was physical or mental abuse years later Got the chance to leave them when I was 16 It stilled fked me up a bit as when I was 14 I smoked cannabis and drank alcohol Fortunately that part didnt last long and I was mentally fit enough to not fall in that hell of a trap But guess what ?

h8vtn5a,p3w5k9,My one friends house has never been dusted or vacuumed they think its fine to just open a window they sit by They have 4 birds 3 dogs 2 cats and a ferret and the dogs will pee or shit anywhere When they see it theyll just leave it for days till it hardens because its easier to pick up and they dont clean where the poo was the sink was over-filled with dishes that theyd eventually just throw out (they ordered out every night anyway) and they had fly catchers everywhere There is bird seed everywhere and they never clean the cages The dogs were almost always kept in a decently large cage/area outside that was also never cleaned out or washed I felt so bad that i commonly would clean out the water bowls and fill them with my bottled water while my friend was busy doing something else at home They always went on vacation every month or two but would have letters on letters from collections for debts but went anyway and my friend was always borrowing money from people I met them in highschool and by then it was too "normal" to them already even if they accepted it wasnt right i tried for years to help them with the habit even cleaning their house out when i was asked to watch the animals while they were gone but the day theyd get back the dogs always already soiled everything and the family would just start leaving trash in the newly cleaned areas The house is a two bedroom and can barely hold the animals let alone humans and every inch of the house is covered in nick nacks like a hoarder would have except when asked they would call everything trash and give none of it any sentimental value either When i asked why they didnt just throw it out theyd always say "theres too much to go out at once" even when id offer to help then theyd say "i have to look through everything first" even though pointing ar individual things theyd easily call each garbage I tried for years to help them kick the habit but once i realized this was never ending when my friend started bringing/leaving trash all over when theyd come to my house and doing things like throwing wrappers food and garbage on my floor It makes me sad because i know my friends parents did that to them and if they werent also a pathological liar and manipulative person id probably still be trying to help them eliminate this behavior but i have too big of trust issues to have someone like that in my life anymore There were rats (not mice) living inside of their walls and i feel like thats the only reason they didnt have roaches I honestly hope this persons life turns out okay but i cant be around any of that anymore,MudSeparate1622,16289234160,5

h8yw9aa,p3w5k9,This is about an old friend of mine In 1996 I went to my friends home who was one of my closest friend that time He was alone at home Our plan was to go out to see other friends What surprised me was he wanted me to wait as he was cooking food for his family (This is weird considering he was just 11 years old and you never expect a boy of that age to cook in our culture) Upon further questioning he told me that he cooks food every day He had an elder brother who was 13 years old that time I asked about his brother and he told me that he doesnt cook As time passed I noticed that his elder brother was the favourite child of his parents I knew my friend was always a trouble maker naughty kid and I thought this being the reason for his parents behaviour His parents always treated me as their son Especially his mother always wanted him to stay close with me as I was one of the bright student in school We were the best friends and the whole school knew about it In 2000 we both left our home and moved to a school in a new city (He was allowed to go out because his parents trusted me) We were sharing a room in the hostel But after 6 months he went back home as he had problem adjusting to the place and his mother wanted him close During this time our friendship eventually ended because of some petty stuff We had no contact after 2001 Later he finished his high school and got admitted to a good college Although we were not in talking terms but we had lot of common friends and I would get updates about him from friends quite often He was a bright kid and was very good in studies But after 2003 he got involved in local mob thing He would take money from people to do their dirty job By 2005 he was leader of a local gang Still things were looking in control But in 2006 he murdered a man (this deceased man had taken money from somebody and was not returning So my friend was paid to extort the money from him During altercation my friend stabbed this man several times) He was suppose to finish his college that year but he did not finish and was underground for 2 years No one had any info about him Finally in 2008 he joined social media After the murder he left country illegally (in a ship container) and made it to Bahrain He added me in social media which I accepted We just had a 2 line chat that time I wanted to stay away from him and never spoke to him after that Later he left Bahrain and moved to Russia in 2015 In 2018 finally a mutual friend told me his entire story So his parents were not his real parents apparently His real father was youngest of 3 brothers When he was just 3 months old his father died in a road accident As his mother was still very young his fathers eldest brother adopted him and his mother was forcefully remarried And he was always treated differently by his step family He was treated well but he was always asked to do house hold jobs My friend was never made aware of this fact till 2003 I am not sure how he got the information but since then he hated his step family He also went and confronted his natural mother in 2004 and for some reason he hated her too And thats when he got involved with all bad stuff In 2005 his step father came to visit him but he disowned his father and went on ranting against the family I never had any soft corner for him after he committed the murder but still I wonder why he did what he did In 2019 I visited his parents It was tough to see his mother Years of crying had made her unrecognisable She told me one thing that I would never forget "If you had stayed friends with him he would have never taken the path that he took" And finally my 2 line chat in 2008 Me: Hope you remember your old friend Him: How can I forget you my best friend I wish we were still friends Me: I wish,Piki4ked,16289837500,9
h8vcs8y,p3w5k9,The mother beating the shit out of the kids ( not so much as like little kids but like 13-16 years old so still kids ) Later i learned by having a bunch of friends that are from islands ( islanders Micronesians Samoans Tongans etc ) Turns out islands specifically Samoans and Tongans their parents litterally beat the shit out of the kids to keep them in line Girls Boys it doesnt matter Whatevers close is a weapon usually a shoe or some sort of cooking utensil in the kitchen And im talking not like a swat on the ass or a dress down Im talking like straight up giving them the business Not one swing not a half hearted swing no half stepping bullshit Im talking mom was like an ex-mma fighter whos parents were probablly the same lineage and beat the shit out of her and her siblings So it continues and the kids get their asses straight up kicked However the family was always nice and the kids were well obviously the kids were very well mannered of course until the mother or father found out that they did something wrong Come home late got in trouble with the cops found some weed on them got caught smoking cigarettes Or one beating i saw was because of the younger of the brothers was caught with beetlenut and had like a stash of all the things used to "chew it" A few cigarettes some leaves of some kind beetlenuts that were fresh so he obviously went to the local asian market and purchased em there the knives or razors to cut the beetlenut the like crushed up coral mixed with something to make some sort of paste and everything else needed in this little stash box he made a hiding placei n his room for (which all of this was forbidden in this household until a certain age or just period no questions asked ) Anyways beetlenut is some sort of local ( to them ) like chew Its this hard green nut ( fresh ) that you slice like 4 times and then take a piece of it along with a bit of loose tobacco from a cigarette some of that coral paste stuff and then wrap it up in this leaf thing Put in mouth Over time it fucks your teeth way up and can turn your lips red ( never have seen this but once i looked it up you see pictures of women of the islands with like blood red lips from the beetlenut chewing/chewage ) Anyways mom made him make one for him and all his siblings ( not all of which embibed in this stuff ) and then chew it For a long ass time Huge ass "servings" While this was happening she beat a few of the kids asses like punches and kicks and then once she got to the culprit it was one of the sickest beat downs with a shoe that ive ever personally seen Not the boomerang eddie murphy stand up style beat down Nope Beat down like this kid stole your money killed your dog burnt your house down or some other felonious crime youd think Bruises and lots of "holy shits" from me ( said internally as i sort of slowly backed away from the action and just watched in horror ) After it was done everyone went about their business like normal fucking day Later on it turns out these beatings happened a lot if the kids stepped out of line of which there were many so many many beat downs Funny thing is: Samoans and Islanders in general that ive known have always been some of the most Loving Generous Honest Loyal Friendliest and soft spoken people of which many i consider great and close friends Ones that would be there in a pinch always put family first and friends if youre close enough were like family They would do anything for you and I in turn did the same because people that like that with morals and general ideals are few and far between Soft Spoken but also when the shit in the fan some of the biggest islanders i knew were the first to stand up step in front of me or whoever was being bullied and challenged and would straight up stomp the shit out of people And then "Hey bruh lets go get a beer or some food" in the sweetest softest voice youve ever heard So maybe as a parent im doing it wrong since these kids obeyed their parents like they were the damn KGB or Mossad or something - if they breached the line or protocol they would get dealt with asap Almost to the point of going home just to get the ass whooping and get it over with Great people Weird upbringing violence and even the girls got their asses kicked But not only being some of the most beautiful girls ive ever seen they are kick ass people and great friends Also they could fight with the best of em and ive even seen a girl put a guy down with a few quick punches and again the group i was with this was normal while the guy who was being a dick and put his hands on the girl while trying to spit some game ( touching not wanted ) got what he deserved **TL;DR**: Islanders will sometimes get the shit beat out of them by the parents for rule breakage or just crossing the many lines set by the parents to the point of oh shit holy shit like MMA beat downs in public or private wherever the knowledge of the infraction was learned That said they are also some of the best friends greatest people faithful honest tough well mannered and just overall soft spoken and soul filled folks ive ever had the pleasure of meeting in my life and am proud to know a few that i can call friends if not family,itsjero,16289123890,16
h8w5kce,p3w5k9,Back in the 70s two kids I knew from school and me went on a day trip with our 40cc motorbikes we were all 16 years old at the time one of the kids was a good friend of mine that I knew for years and our parents knew eachother too and the other kid was more of an acquaintance who was new to the school and we were just getting to know him better Anyway that kid I forgot his name told us we should go to his place before we headed out of the city to pick up some money so we drove to his parents house went inside and met his parents for the first time His parents were much older than our parents they must have gotten him at a very late age because to sixteen years old me they looked really old After some greetings and introducing us to his parents the kid immediately tells his dad "Give me XXX amount of money" and the dad told him he could get some money but not as much as he asked for and that kid flips out and hits his dad he actually punched his dad in the face and started screaming at his dad to give him the money punching him a few times more It was immediately clear to my friend and me that this guy was terrorizing his parents we were both extremely chocked and bailed out of that place we never spoke to that guy anymore and he probably understood we didnt like him because he never approached us after that incident either altough we all went to the same school,Mokumer,16289333680,2

Thatd suck cause the dad was actually a cool guy just didnt have much money 3: this place still managed to be 400 better than my drunk schitzo abusive dads house that had never been cleaned and had clothes all over the floor along with broken toy peices and he was so strict about not wearing shoes inside that he even argued with two police officers and screamed that they couldnt come in if they didnt take their shoes off dont remember how that ended 4: i remember going to another familys house that floors with clothes all over and glass in one corner no one bothered to clean the parents were fat and always smoking tons of weed and would yell at the kids to do whatever they wanted or they would slap them across the face the kids were 6 to 8 years old And there was probably a whole plethora of other houses like this that i either dont remember cause of age or just thought they were normal at the time and never thought much into them Jesus Christ Im barely into my teens and Ive seen sime fucked up shit i just want to leave this goddanmed place as soon as possible and leave that shit behind me,wooblydooblygod,16289355440,2

h0z9vsy,nuceo8,Here be the tales of Waffles one of my best (entirely accidental) plotlines I had a peddler who sold bullshit homebrew merchandise outside of a port city When you purchased anything from him you rolled a d20 and based on your roll it was usually nothing but occasionally turned out to be blessed or cursed Since he existed on a pier you could buy before setting sail but it was a complete gamble that might result in losing money and ending up with a completely garbage item One of the party members bought an item called "mummy dust" that would supposedly conjure a mummy to fight for you if you threw it onto the ground in battle Well this guy throws the mummy dust down a few days letter and lo and behold he gets a small imp-like creature named Waffles Waffles is half-bat half-monkey and beholden to follow simple instructions but is also an incredible fucking nuisance Waffles can speak about as well as a 3-year-old child in a very shrill high voice Waffles can teleport (if he has a line of sight) which means he can get into any room with a keyhole but Waffles is generally too simple to be useful for any sort of thievery Waffles is very loud high-maintenance and generally annoying Waffles eats birds (and also anything with a bird on it including coins jewelry and finery) Waffles cant overtly disobey but he also cant leave his master lie directly (even if ordered) follow instructions of more than 2 steps or concentrate for longer than a few minutes at a time Waffles definitely has some simple magic but Waffles is not a creature whose magic can really be directed or controlled He mostly uses it to find and eat birds Despite his magic Waffles rapidly becomes a massive burden to the party Having been conjured you cannot get rid of him He is bound to whomever conjured him and hes an incredible piece of indestructible shit He periodically shrieks "HI IM WAFFLES I EAT BIRDS" All efforts to make Waffles useful fail abysmally and the party eventually just learns to ignore him Fast-forward My party has been sailing around a little archipelago and have come to an island The people of the island worship an active volcano and make sacrifices into it After weeks of adventuring on the island the party manages to successfully stop a ritual sacrifice and free a bunch of slave women Waffles is with them the whole time and he has mostly just tagged along eating birds (He has gotten them into trouble twice: once by eating a cargo hold full of exotic birds being shipped for trade and once by eating a register full of coins stamped with a bird logo) So the island volcano begins to erupt and its revealed that the villagers werent actually completely full of shit The volcano is actually the sentient avatar of a volcano demi-god The island *is* the god and the villagers knew what they were doing and now it appears the whole island is about to erupt into flame and fall into the sea because of its lack of sacrifice My party instead of getting off the island decides to run up to the peak of the volcano and do battle with the volcano god Needless to say they get their asses kicked Then just as it seems like the whole party is about to be completely destroyed the guy who is in charge of Waffles looks at me and and says "Hey is it a clear night?" I have him roll Yes its a clear night; they can see the stars remember how I said Waffles can teleport as long as he has a line of sight? The player actually got choked up as he said "Waffles I want you to grab onto the volcano god and teleport into the sky as far and high as you can" Waffles grabs onto the volcano god with his long fingers In a blink they disappear The island is quiet Then in the sky my party sees the tail of a comet streaking toward earth It grows closer and closer With an earth-shattering shake the star lands on the island breaking off part of it and obliterating a huge swatch of jungle The fallout from this event is absolutely catastrophic It destroys half the island though it does save the other half and miraculously the idiot party that wanted to fight an actual literal god has all lived to tell the tale Emboldened by their success the party charges into the fiery wreckage to see what has become of the volcano god In a crater as deep as three men amidst the rubble and burned-out hellscape that was once a lush jungle they find Waffles clinging to a black stick of a still-smoking tree His leathery wings are burnt away leaving only sticks protruding from his back and he is blackened with soot barely living Seeing his master he looks up and stutters out in his high-pitched irritating little voice: "Hi Im W-waffles I eat b-birds",IAlbatross,16231147510,22

h109rl3,nuceo8,How a cursed magic item filled the Astral Sea with flies in my campaign: Me: an artificer whos the sarcastic one on the team Usually for crafting magic items I roll randomly on a hidden table since its not a super high-magic campaign Was hoping to get a decanter of endless water for some reason but never did Rolls randomly and builds a blue gem doesnt know what it does also builds a cursed bag of holding that costs money to retrieve items from 3 sessions later druid gets cursed and shapeshifted into a frog when its over he still has a craving for flies I joke that maybe I should build him a decanter of endless flies he says that would be gross but I still end up inventing an electric fly swatter for him next morning we wake up gem is gone we see an enormous swarm of some kind approaching from the horizon oh\_shitexe party goes into full panic mode turtles up in our Leomunds Tiny Hut freaking out because the swarm is unrelenting after hours and were pretty sure it was sent to deter us from going into this one area we need to get into to retrieve an artifact capable of slaying an evil god tries Speak with Dead Speak with Animals everything we could think of to try to figure out where these flies were sent from nothing realized flies couldnt pay the fee to get out of the cursed bag of holding so I dipped it out into the swarm and grabbed a bunch of flies which were now trapped inside spoke with a fly and asked him how many flies there were in the swarm he responded "one" because that was as high as he could count experimenting with all sorts of ways to escape eventually go with spirit guardians cleric becomes buzzsaw of death as the party makes a mad dash through the swarm then it turns out the swarm is only about 30 feet thick and just miles long we walk along the path of the swarm back to its origin and there is a single decanter that looks exactly like a decanter of endless water did we really just spend two hours on that DM starts googling "ecological consequences of fruit fly swarms" and "how many flies are in 15000 kg of biomass per day" me: I stick the decanter inside the bag of holding DM: wizard: what happens when a bag of holding reaches capacity? DM: the bag explodes and spills all its contents on the astral plane me: so basically in a month the astral plane is just gonna be flies DM: yup me: good thing I patented electric fly swatters before it was cool Apparently the gem was cursed to turn into whatever sarcastic suggestion I made next,SojournerSomething,16231376550,6

Which is what we ultimately did - we went through the canalisation and thanks to my architecture skill we had a good enough idea where to plant the explosives to just let the entire compound go one floor down (And this would not be the closest I came to active terrorism in SR Just for the record),CPTpurrfect,16230969650,5

h0z0fbp,nuceo8,There was an item (I dont remember the name but it honestly doesnt matter) from The Adventure Zone: Season 1 that was inherently worthless but you could convince someone to trade you their most valuable possession for it Basically it was meant to be an item you could use to get an NPC to give you the MacGuffin without a lot of haggling In between adventures the players go to the "fantasy Costco" to spend their money on various items and this is where the item was offered to them In the same Costco was an overpowered sword that cost so much the players could not afford it The DM did not anticipate that the wizard of the party would buy the item and then immediately using it on the shopkeep to get the overpowered sword,DifficultHat,16231101380,4

h0yh685,nuceo8,Mice God those mice It all started with a simple request by a wizard to collect mice I was told they were rainy day rations or bait for another larger creature Sound enough great(ish) plan Fast forward three or four sessions many mice gathered and all trained to obey basic orders and commands now the rodents have an exclusive role in the game Exploitation of local entrepreneurs The wizard gets the halfling to sneak into a place of business and release the mice at night The crew less the wizard goes into the now mice infested place of business the next day and proceeds to complain to the owner about the rodent problem The wizard comes in later and gives the sales pitch as the only person who can sure fire solve this rodent infestation using magic with no mess or clean up for a price of course The wizard then puts on some show to make himself seem more important and powerful than he is and the shop keepers watch in awe as the rodents flee from their shop like they were afraid to be inside (only to regroup to the wizard shortly after so they can be reused) Of course the shop keepers are ecstatic and happily turn over the coin after the issue has been remedied Ive tried (in character and out) to fight this and they always seem to get the payday This is now a staple way to make a buck in the game for my party TL;DR: a wizard in my group trained mice and uses them to infest a business then he exploits the owner and takes payment to "solve the rodent problem" Infinite money,comfortlad,16231009890,4

So we offered him a fruit of 1 week slumber on our way out as an apology We hung outside for 10 minutes then went back in The DM was incredulous as he rolled to see if the shopkeeper would take a bite The new DM made the roll almost impossible and he did take a bite We locked the shop door and plundered everything Then we sold to make money and buy a wagon to carry all of our high level magic items we just plundered Shortly thereafter the DM caused a "divine intervention " to force us on the path he wanted We didnt play with that DM anymore and he complained for years about how we didnt do what he wanted,trogdorburninatorh,16231166480,1

I think it was somewhere on Reddit where I find a list of useless minorly magical items- which I love because I dont like to just throw weapons and clutter at my players and I love seeing the uses they come up with for things (especially when its just fun little character things) So at one point our barbarian finds a set of painted wax apples- a red blue and yellow one These apples can change the color of any object they touch for up to three days I didnt think it sounded like it could break the game or anything just some fun shenanigans here and there So a couple sessions later our party comes across a coastal town being plagued by a moving island that keeps crashing its supply ships- I went into great detail about how they couldnt import or export by sea anymore and how the town was dying and fishermen were losing theor family businesses and all that They meet an artificer who offers to pay them a crap ton of gold to retrieve a package from a ship that was attacked by this living island and after some investigating they decide to visit the island itself Im sure you know the drill- its actually a dragon turtle with a cult of kobolds living on it stealing supplies and treasures kobolds try to kill them for trying to steal the package from the dragons hoard yadda yadda When they found this out they immediately want to speak to this turtle dragon My players are (generally) good aligned they like to try diplomacy first almost all the time (which I love frankly) However because they are so good alligned I sort of expected them to have this poor little coastal towns best interests at heart Nope They tell the dragon "If you give us the package well show you how to lure even MORE ships in! With these magic apples you can turn yourself into a spectacle that people will just HAVE to investigate!" And you know it was a clevet solution and use of minor objects kind of in character for the dragon to consider it So I let them roll for it and behold They avoided a big battle made an ally of a freakin dragon and doomed an entire town and countless sailors for some money All with some apples covered in finger paint One of these days I want to send them back to that town so they can see the full consequences Just for giggles,Vessel_of_Ineptitude,16231169330,1

h5j1qbf,olspwd,Perfect timing for this thread and I dont know if this counts but I was at an open air rave in a forest outside of the city last night with friends I had a friend visiting me abroad from our home city so we decided we will leave the rave when the sky shows first signs of any daylight So the sky turns a bit blue so we decide to leave the others behind and walk 9 kilometers next to the river to the nearest train station to return home As we were walking through nature we reached the industrial zone (cement and concrete factory) and we were passing through it with a few loners passing by also trying to get home On our way we run into a "couple" that looked like they were tucked together kissing but then the guy turned around and noticed us so they continued to walk instead While we were passing them the guy asks the two of us if we have a cigarette to which I replied no (I only had rolling tobacco with me and I couldnt be arsed to stand there while he rolls himself a cigarette) he then asks if we had a condom (this was an orange flag to me) so I just shrugged it off at first and said no However the girl calls out for me in a very mellow voice and says that she wants to go home I turn to ask her again to repeat it just in case I heard it wrong and she says she wants to go home I ask her does she want to go home with the guy she says no and makes hand gestures as if she wants to push the guy away So I turn to the guy and tell him "Im sorry mate you have to leave she wants to go home" She then says he is nice but that she wants to go home she looked really confused I told her he may not be nice if she doesnt know him because he just asked us if we had a condom She looked shocked and my friend pushed the guy away because he was walking with us so he goes away He was constantly saying its all good and he will leave but kept walking next to my friend at one point my friend gets agitated and pushes him away and tells him to leave He goes aside and stays behind So we try to get this confused girl to tell us how she wants to go home if she wants an Uber We stop at the end where the road begins and try to call an Uber she asks for our address to put it in there as our first stop and hers as second but we were against it because we didnt have money to pay for that big trip we planned to walk anyways She was so out of her mind on mdma that she couldnt order an Uber and understand simple question of explaining how she planned this trip Anyways she reassures us that its okay even if she goes alone orders an Uber which turns out to be a Turkish driver and she is Turkish too so she speaks to him in Turkish like he was her friend After the call she tells us its okay and that we can now leave her alone so we say goodbye and walk a bit further away out of her sight by we stop and wait until we see her sit in the car 10 minutes later she sits in the Uber and leaves (100% her Uber because it had also a taxi sign on top matched the description of the Uber app and no other cars but Ubers ride in this street at this hour The car passes us we see her sitting in the back and we leave I like to think that we saved someone from being raped this early morning,gljivicad,16265385870,17
h5luhic,olspwd,A few years ago I was walking real late at night around 2am I decide to go through our downtown which isnt a big downtown I live in a small town So Im walking through an alley across the street from our Rite-Aid and as I approach one particular house I look to my left and there sits a HUGE pit bulloff the chain just sitting there looking at me I immediately shit my pants but break eye contact with the dog and just tell myself "Dont panic dont panic just walk" I am still trying to peep him out the corner of my eye in case he tries sneak attacking me I finally get far enough away that I felt safe But for those 45 or so seconds I was sweating bullets! I get a little further down our downtown and I am now on our main street As Im walking west I notice a guy approaching me coming east I pause my music in case he tries to sneak attack me (I always do this I must have a phobia of being sneak attacked lol) As he gets closer he speaks to me: "hey man wanna buy some DVDs"? He is holding a clear bag of what I suspect are DVDs "No thanks" I tell him and try to continue on "Wait a minute" he says and reaches his hand into the bag At this point I am thinking he is pulling out a knife and is going to rob me so I back up a couple steps and get into fight position He pulls out a Girls Gone Wild DVD and tries selling it to me I tell him no thanks and that I dont even have my wallet on me To that he said "we can walk to your house so you can get money" So at that point I had to get stern with him and I basically told him to get lost Came home and told my wife both stories and she told me I need to stop walking at night lol,stevemourer,16265933700,9
h5hic9g,olspwd,I was walking alone at 3am in Madison WI and there was a van broken down on the side of the street by Capitol Market Two big men approach me crowd me a bit and ask me if I had any money to help them Not in a mugging way but in a we-might-mug-you type of semivibe I was a college kid literally broke zero cash just taking a break studying from my fucked sleep schedule I had nothing so thats what I tell them Offered them a cigarette and said I might have some change at home lol Kinda unintentional badass response looking back  sorry fellas They ask where I live and I tell them its a few blocks away yet and noped the fuck outta there The next day I saw their mugshots on the news for mugging an old lady Close fucking call Another time in a more rural Wisconsin town I was biking on a trail late at night with my aunt and uncle after a local festival Pitch black on the trail and out of nowhere these two fucking white dreadlocked crackie looking guys hop out from each side of the bushes on either side of the trail and confront us There are definitely plenty of junkies around our area who would pull this type of stunt My aunt whipped out a knife and shines her flashlight in their face I dont think they realized there were 3 of us and that we had weapons and bikes lol They just kinda played it off and we kept going Another close fucking call Last one Im not sure counts but I walked to the local park while it was still light out to shoot hoops I was like 15-16 at the time Anyways I stayed until the sun went down As the sun was setting I realized there was this windowless van that had parked on the street and been sitting there for a while and the driver had not gotten out In fact the driver was staring right fucking at me I didnt want to leave the courts because Im pretty sure I was about to get abducted I was so scared I called my mom to pick me up and when she pulled up the van drove away Close fucking call! Im sure Im forgetting other ones I used to talk to a lot of homeless people in the middle of the night in Madison and saw fucked up shit through that Also cars driving by multiple times people following me in Milwaukee animals shadowy figures and the like Glorious times,formerlybrucejenner,16264992580,6
h5hiccb,olspwd,Well this probably doesnt really count and probably fake since my dad likes to fuck around with me a lot but still a cool story(also sorry for bad grammar and spelling) My dad was at around 16 at the time I think So it all started when he went to a store to get a drink he got his change back although the dollar was ripped he still accept it and went off with his day(or I guess night since it was at around 10 pm) he would walk on the train tracks to go back home and there would always be dogs nearby that would bark like crazy when they heard the sound of even a leaf falling from a tree Anyways as my dad kept on going on the train tracks the dogs barked more and more not just because he was getting closer but like the dogs were going insane they even started to cry in fear you could say Well suddenly the dogs just stopped they just stopped completely and it was just silence out of nowhere that is when my dad saw a figure infront of him He was skeptical to get close but it was the only way he couldve went so he continued walking forward that is when the guy (looked like a mess) asked him "can you help me cross?" My dad got the idea that he was asking for taxi money in which he says"I am sorry but I dont have much moneyI can give you this ripped dollar but I dont know if it will help you" The guy silently thanks him and continues walking forward my dad still not thinking much of it goes home My dad likes to put his wallet and keys next to the door so he would never lose his stuff still does now the following morning he goes on with his day and goes to work He reaches for his wallet and inside he finds the same ripped dollar,sunnysideggo,16264992600,5

h5i9b93,olspwd,I was maybe 9 years old at the time but my two younger siblings myself and my mom were all walking back home from a baseball game featuring the local minor league team and we were walking past what looked like an an assault/shakedown in process This one woman who must have been no older than 25 years old was violently pressing another up to the side of a building with her forearm onto her clavicle or pressing her face first into the building with her forearm on the back of her neck or at worst pressing her up and threatening her with a knife Im pretty certain she was asking her where her money was All I know is she was being violently pushed up against the side of a building Of course as were all walking by my loudmouth sister asks my mom "Mom whats going on over there?"

h5i1ouf,olspwd,Okay I have two incidents one occurred in my house in Vermont and another on the streets of New York City near Harlem 1) I (26 yo white cis male) am not new to the concept of alcohol by any capacity  if you catch my drift I have definitely made some poor decisions in my brief time on our spinning magma-rock however I have always found that drunk Humtar often treats himself better to nightly self care/cleaning rituals than sober Humtar (I know sad aint it) Anywho Im in my house in Vermont and I have three people staying with me and Im pretty sure theyre all hooking up or some shit I go to bed and distinctly remember putting myself to sleep Fast forward to morning I wake up alone nakedwhich is a little unusual for me because Im an underwear sleeper I am a roller-turner-starfish when I sleep so I think to myself "I probably pulled them off in my snoozles" I look in my bed and around the floor of my room and they are NOWHERE to be found Curioushowever upon inspecting my room I happen to find a BATHMAT?!?! Like a mini towel WTF I think okay inspect the house I walk out of my room and proceed to walk down the stairs to the kitchen and low and behold my underwear is in the stairwell OMG Mortified me has no inclination as to the events that proceeded (like did I make a fool of myself or try to join the threesome or worse hurt someone else in any capacity?) My guests all claim to have not seen or know anything Still perturbed to this day by that and uncontrollable actions 2) Few years back in the before-times I was working in NYC at a fancy restaurant and living in SoHo (300 bucks a month believe it or not) Its a few weeks before Christmas and its chilly but everything is lit up so beautifully I have a buddy lets call him Mark who came down to NYC from VT to work at one of those Christmas tree stands they have in big cities Its pretty good money for a short amount of time (six weeks) However seeing as its Marks first time doing this the company gave him a pretty shotty situation Hes up in central/East Harlem above central park AND he is on the night shift (I think it was 9pm to 9am) However they also paid for meals (I think 25$ a day) and housed him too for free (it was definitely crappy situations tho) Anyways hed tell me stories about having to shoo off PCP users tweaking in the Christmas trees and people falling face first into the pavement Rough spot Every once in a while I would go up and visit him He had this little makeshift shack that we would smoke some herb in (cant handle my shit anymore) and hotbox and I would usually bring a bottle of sparkling wine (or two) to sip on while we chilled for an hour or two I did this probably 4 times and never had any incidence TIME 5: (omg) So I get off of my shift and head up to meet him Prolly dont arrive until like 12:30 am (Im coming from FiDi) I meet up with him and we do our usual thing and hang out It was extra cold this day so we spent a lot of time in his little hut TBH we never really locked it when we were in it however I was sitting closest to the door and something just fucking compelled me to lock it this spontaneous instance We hear some rusting and banging and murmuring from the non-visible side of the hut THIS DUDE fucking pops around the corner of the hut (theres a small plexiglass window in the door) and hes wielding an EIGHT INCH BLADE screaming "Im gunna fucking kill you you f-ts"(we no homo just homIES) and is repeating yanking and shaking the door and telling us to "open up" We are so startled by this and were both looking around like what are we going to wield in self-defense god forbid that door or plexi gives out My choice is a drill and my buddys was his guitar (what a fucking tale THAT wouldve been) This man was probably screaming and hollering and banging and wielding his knife for like 30 secs (felt like thirty minutes) and then the HALAL FOOD TRUCK MAN who is like 35 feet away saves our fucking lives and jumps out of his FT brandishing an enormous meat cleaver and chases mr "crackhead(?)" away We call the cops but nothing comes of it My friend also calls his boss at like 2:30 in the morning and says that hes not super comfortable staying here all alone anymore with crazed 8" blade dude running around threatening people and ultimately ends up coming back to my place that night and staying two days Mark quit that job but still made bank for the three weeks he was there for Ahhhh good times,Humtar,16265157830,2

h5iv21k,olspwd,i walk at night around Hollywood Bound to see some crazy shit all the time given the number of addicts on the streets of LA But usually its just that non-threatening chaos BUT there are exceptions Worst was a guy asking for money who pursued me angrily when I said "no" and shouted about me being a "rich murderer who took his life from him" among much more colorful language He really came at me hard but never got within a couple yards Just pursued and occasionally pushed a trashcan over Normally in such situation I would drop into a store and let security deal with it or something but I was south of the sound stages on Romaine at Sunset/Las Palmas Studios and that area really is empty at night when productions wrap So it was just me and this goblin Finally I got over to Raos (a swanky restaurant nearby) and the dishwasher was emptying trash after closing I shout at him to help me deal with this guy and he comes over but the guy still comes at both of us I tell the dishwasher this guy has been doing this for two blocks so he runs around front to get the valet guys who are still there and then we all just stand united against the guy and he shouts profanities then he leaves Whole time Im thinking "Dont get stabbed Dont get stabbed Dont get stabbed" Then after it was done myself and the kitchen staff dissipated and went about our business,captainmcfuckface,16265353730,2

Do you know where you need to go?"

gy2mcu5,nc0yya,Cuba is often portrayed as romantic without any petty crime I went there with a friend (two guys) and frankly the Cuban people in Havana were the rudest least helpful and least trustworthy people I have ever met They will scam every single time they can get away with it: I negotiated a price with a taxi driver who upon dropping us off decided to charge us five times the price There was a cop nearby so I called him over The cop took my money from the driver and they both drop away! No petty crime? An acquaintance I hung out with had her phone stolen from her zipped up purse in a club within a few minutes of getting there Two days prior her friend also had her phone stolen in broad daylight Cat calling and misogyny was absolutely constant it was like a national sport Everywhere you go theres a guy sitting on the sidewalk whistling at every single woman walking by! I was dancing in a platonic manner with two women friends whe and this guy (easily twenty years older than us) kept on trying to join the dance After we all tell him nicely were there to be only between us he got upset and shouted to me that "I was not allowed to have two women to myself and that I should give him the one I preferred the least" Every single person who talks to you wants you to buy some random garbage they sell like yesterdays paper (I kid you not on that one) and itll be at a higher rate than the daily one They never have change and they will walk away never to be seen again when they say theyll leave for change They dont want to help ever The host of the Airbnb didnt know what there was to do in Havana! He didnt have a map of his city either Hed lived there for forty years It took me some long convincing to convince him to give me directions to the city center To clarify: I speak pretty good Spanish traveled to thirty seven countries staying both in cheap hostels or at hosts both wealthy and very poor countries Ive met my fair share of rude and friendly people alike Only in Cuba was the vibe this bad,TophrBR,16209748750,2

Hes using the line of logic that in 50 years will result in the Holocaust Then of course theres Social Darwinism which at its worst and most self-serving turned into "If youre poor and dying thats a needed culling that will make our economy and society stronger" Darwin to be clear didnt create these offshoots of his theory and of course humans have been finding ways to decide that other people dont count as people for as long as weve had humans However Darwins ideas were quickly seized and used as the implicit or explicit underpinning of over a century of justifications for every kind of exploitation and bloodshed ETA: Since its getting repetitious to reply to individual comments please note that Im not denying the accuracy of Darwins theory (he was clearly right at least in the broad strokes) attacking his intentions (see sentence 1 "unintentional") or holding him personally responsible for the damage (see second to last sentence) This is a post about the power of ideas and their uncontrollable and often unforseen consequences not an attack on the theory of evolution,Terpsichorean_Wombat,16285668010,117

h8ejmld,p1f1gn,Jack Welch CEO of GE 1979-2001 He was the most effective cheerleader and implementer of: 1) Free Market Fundamentalism where markets solve all problems and stock holders are the only stake holders that matter A) CEO compensation with stock options B) A focus on stock price to evaluate the success of a company 2) Shrink-to-Grow "growth" which is basically a Ponzi scheme where you sell off assets (increasing quarterly profits and decreasing costs) to get additional money from the stock market so you can buy other companies and destroy them A) Firing the bottom 5% to 10% of employees every year B) Grading every employee on BS metrics like six sigma training which brain washed people to care only about numbers and metrics The effectiveness of shrink-to-grow to produce double digit grow year after year had the effect of flipping the function of the stock market It used to be invest-to-grow Since 1990 its been about shrink-to-grow It also created many copy cat CEOs that created the huge M&A boom of the 1990s and 2000s 3) Outsourcing to low cost countries 4) Six Sigma methodology applied to people (which leads to highly unethical behavior by people who think they are doing the right thing) 5) Management by numbers (which fails to see value in anything not easily quantifiable with many unethical consequences) This meme infected higher education especially MBAs 6) The destruction of countless lives and communities 7) The destruction of General Electric 8) The mindset in the public that stock price for companies or GDP for countries is THE metrics of success There are countless bad memes promoted by this horrible man that still permeate society and have spread across the globe The Neutron Jack Effect is huge and massively negative,LSheraton,16285993040,2
h8fd0k7,p1f1gn,Wow I dont know about all of mankind but I got one that is probably going to trigger some people Ronald fucking Reagan Dude came into office and de-regulated everything around him The 2008 collapse that was caused by greedy bankers and Wall St? Yeah Deregulations by Reagan allowed these financial giants to basically run the country and while the normal person was losing their home the banks got bailed out Mad about the environment? Look no further than his de-regulations on manufacturing essentially allowing businesses to pollute the air with hardly any problem Look at the rate of the top 1% over the past 100 years You can see that as soon as Reagan de-regulated everything the top 1% took advantage and gained more than ever before His Reaganomics relied on the "trickle down effect" which was basically helping businesses gain money in a very quick manner and these gains were supposedly going to "trickle down" to the every day worker Did that happen? Even today while billionaires gain more ground many workers have been sitting at a minimum wage of $725 for 12 years even though the cost of living has exponentially increased Even if you just look at inflation alone the last time that minimum wage was raised in 2009 that same dollar is worth just $073 today yet we are having trouble getting a new minimum wage passed? Want to guess why? Well follow the money Money = power in America and raising the minimum wage would take money out of the 1% pocket Thank Ronald Reagan for just handing over all the power in the US to to 1%,MReprogle,16286127320,2

h8f4t05,p1f1gn,I honestly think John Sununu who "legitimized" climate change denial may have doomed us all He was a brilliant engineer MIT doctorate former gov of NH high ranking adviser of George H W Bush The idea of man made climate change was just catching on and the US was pushing the world to sign a far more aggressive climate treaty than the current Paris Accords This was in like 1991 At this point the anti-climate change folks were arguing that it may not be as bad or happen as quickly as we think and it may not be entirely humanitys fault and whatever we do we should try not to wreck the economy while fixing the climate It was literally unheard of it deny climate change outright Sununu who fancied himself a computational modeler (even though the finite element analysis / modeling he did in engineering is nothing at all like climate modeling) decided he was smarter than the teams of NASA climatologists who were telling Bush about the dangers of climate change He had personal beef with one of the lead scientists too and his ego couldnt let it go He convinced Bush Sr that it was all bullshit and got the US to pull out of the treaty dooming it to fail He then wrote an op-ed about how NASA are just crackpots and doomsayers and insisted the entire thing is a hoax to get grant money That was the first time in history anyone with any serious "scientific" credibility denied climate change was not real I honestly think the opponents didnt even consider blanket denial until Sununu came forward It changed the landscape overnight and within a month dozens or [fossil fuel funded] scientists and strangely enough meteorologists had come forward agreeing Thus was born the whole "*its not real its a hoax*" movement were still battling today I sincerely think in the long run hell have been indirectly responsible for a billion deaths I hope history remembers him accordingly Think of how much further ahead humanity would be if we started taking serious action 30 years ago We lost that chance all because one cocky engineer thought he was smarter than everyone else couldnt stay in his lane and would risk the entire world to satisfy his ego The SAT word of the day is *ultracrepedarian*: "expressing opinions on matters outside the scope of ones knowledge or expertise",Ut_Prosim,16286092810,1

We tried working up a new plan because our boss and another friends gangly sister could help us and we were using their van anyway We were going to capture and torture this guy that we thought was a terrorist get the reward money for turning him over to the police to buy more gas but ended up crashing the van because someone cut the brakes,GrungeHamster23,16219188430,94

Lol you guys are wild! Edit 4: so the beloved restaurant owner left the car salesmans restaurant partnership because of this fiasco Some say there was some tension about how the business was ran and some say there was tension because he was cheating on his wife Status Update: the latest rumor off the old grape vine says the restaurant owner got a killer deal from the local real estate guy and will renovate an old closed business downtown into his new restaurant!

hszmj5s,s5m4up,I live in a little valley (outside a large town) of maybe 50 people Since we live in a fairly dangerous place climate-wise were fairly interconnected There are several infamous characters the most unpleasant of whom is this retired dude Jay Hes easily the most aggressive and abrasive person I have ever met He has begun every conversation we have ever had at an 11 and just works himself up from there frequently raising his voice to me while I sit silently behind the wheel of my car waiting for him to finish so I can get into town Things Jay cares about: 1) access to his property and 2) the fact that he spends "thousands! thousands!" of dollars "every year!" to plow a particular short stretch of road up to his house Everyone who might ever drive on that stretch of road leaves during the winter with one exception: me I moved in less than a year ago and he has brought this up during every single conversation I recently offered to give him money and he insisted it isnt about money its about respect and he wants me to "work it out" with him He says hes "big on favors" and likes to "barter" He often uses the phrase "you scratch my back" but weirdly doesnt ever include the second half of the saying His wife is infamously banging someone else in the valley theyve been off and on again for years and are apparently "open" but everyone is scandalized that shes sleeping with one of the neighbors (and imo thats pretty fucking shitty of her and shes actually as creepy as he is based on two encounters with her thus far) I cant imagine who will ever read this but recently my car slid off the road and got stuck in a sort of precarious place I had to leave it where it was overnight and returned the next day with help only to find he had snow plowed me in The last time we spoke in person he jokingly threatened to push my car off the mountain In those words I was furious and spent hours shoveling the snow plow pile out of the way so the tractor (a very kind neighbor lent us) could pull me out I would LOVE to share the texts with you if anyone is interested because Im still pretty pissed about all this edit: [the messages](https://imgurcom/a/utfhqRE),in-site,16423880830,59
hszg0fb,s5m4up,There is a professional pond excavator in our town Many people want ponds because the land is basically six inches from being swamp Our township did not have an ordinance for anything related to ponds so he was just digging ponds to whatever the homeowners requested This rubbed the township bureaucrats the wrong way so they set about trying to craft an ordinance This got a significant amount of interest because it tried to put a lot of restrictions on ponds that people were not happy with Eventually this took so much time and created so much animosity that several of the appointed township officers resigned and were not replaced because the elected board members were split half and half on the pond issue so nobody would agree on anything A recall election for the Township Supervisor was conducted and he survived it BUT he was unintentionally incorrectly re-sworn in to office (wrong person performed the swearing in) One of his opposing people on the board discovered this error and intentionally did not say anything until after the date specified in the charter that he needed to be sworn in had passed and then she mounted a legal challenge that he was illegitimately holding office and asked that he be removed The town rallied behind the sitting Supervisor and made enough noise that he was re-sworn in He and his wife (clerk) were promptly voted out in the next general election later that year because he kept pushing the pond ordinance that nobody wanted It was a mess for 8-10 months in our township where absolutely nothing got done I got stuck in the middle because we were trying to get a solar panel installed and there was nobody to approve the site plan or inspect anything We had it lucky though other people had various stages of home remodels stalled for this long for the same reason and a new desperately needed cell tower was complete and waiting to be switched on pending an electrical inspection for a full year because there was no inspector The pond ordinance remains topic of hot debate and is still not written but ponds still get dug ,TheyStillOweYouMoney,16423852760,47

best Paul the owner also has a son (junior) and wife who help out with the family business Its literally amazing I spent most of my childhood and teenage years there learning how to fight As the years go by though things change Pauls son is growing up and wants to be more in charge of the business Junior and Paul often fight and cant stand one another But thats okay because Uno the right hand man is always there to pick up the slack and teach awesome classes But as the years go by things are starting to get worse Let me mention- theres a lot of politics and favoritism in both Paul and Juniors classes Unos classes are relatively fair and inclusive Uno makes sure everyone is included and gets detailed help regardless of wether or not theyre the favorite or not Like I said uno is the heart and soul of the place and without him the whole thing is kind of sour because Paul and Junior arent very sociable and have little to no people skills but decent martial arts My point being if youre not theyre favorite classes arent enjoyable for you Then all of a sudden Paul sign the place over to Junior Classes become more like gym classes and its more of a mcdojo belt factory than a martial arts school Hes not trying to teach self refense- hes trying to sign up as many kids as possible to make money Then I fall out of favor with Paul and Junior I quit the tournent team Its been a long time coming- I just wasnt enjoying it anymore I wanted to do more mma stuff but Paul said I had to stick to point fighting At that point I become a pariah but its okay- Im exclusively going to classes taught by Uno at this point and when I tell Uno after classes how unhappy I am he decided l to start his own martial arts school Me his girlfriend and a handful of other students leave with him This causes a shit storm we dont stick around to see Paul is kind of a narcist and has told his instructors they "belong" to him and that he will "bury them" if they decide to undercut his business Uno doesnt care Opens a small school just outside of town I have a decent rank and experience at this point so Im helping him run the place along with his dad who also does martial arts Things are great- Uno even buys his own house and me his gf and I all hang out and have dinner there ECT Then- Unos girlfriend goes batshit crazy Writes him a bad check on the houses accuses him of cheating on her (he didnt) and just has a completell mental break Shes goes from zero to 100 and Im shouted and screamed at several times for no reason leaving me in a fragile state It all comes to a head one night when I get knocked out during a sparring match It was an honest mistake Uno and I were sparring after hours But Im fucked up with a concussion and half conscious Uno helps me to the car and drives me to the hospital As this is happening his gf is calling and textinghim threatening to kill herself if hes not home STAT Not the first time shes done this but hes not abandoning me at the hospital and cant go home to make sure shes safe so he calls the cops and she gets put in a psych hold To make a long story short I lived and Uno and hid gf broke up A month after their breakup I admit Ive always had feeling for uno but didnt want to step in on what was his happy relationship We start dating Now his crazy ex gf has gone to the OTHER martial arts school in town (the pizzas) Shes starter a smear campaign telling everyone all sorts of crap about her ex uno We know this because one of Unos old friends goes there During this time one of the old students from the Alphas joins us Like us he used to be a favorite but quit tournament team and got tired of being a punching bag He has a blast with us and we love having him From them we learn the Alphas situation has deteriorared- basically all the ranking teens and adults "volunteer" ie provide free labor for junior and Paul runs the "leadership guidance class" that they all attend which is basically him power tripping the whole time Also- they filed a suspicious PPP loan for $11k with some strange details on it Its sketchy enough I mentioned it to the govt tipline because thats taxpayer dollars So yeah- I help Uno run his school and weve been dating for 2 years now The police have told his ex not to contact him again but every now and then we see her around town and she glares at us I joke with Uno all the time that even if we break up we have to be friends because due to the state of politics/karate drama in town I doubt Im welcome at the school his ex goes to or the school we left Hit me with any questions you have It might sound crazy but its my life lmao (Also before you ask- I did not cheat with Uno She wrote him a bad check for the down paymenton the house and I told him that was fucked up and from there she spiraled into her mental health crisis),throwaway1999000,16423861270,3

hszlkcc,s5m4up,Not as recent but the oil bible man in north GA comes to mind He bought a plastic box and mineral oil from Tractor Supply and spread a rumor that the bible spontaneously produced oil Overnight and only when no one was looking and only when it was alone in the box Pinky promise Now if youre uneducated and brainlessly slurp down the magic sky man juice this is a great story- so folks rejoiced Jesus is returning and he chose hodunk nowhere north GA (why choose anywhere near the middle east?) Also the oil bible man coincidentally really *really* needed you to donate money to the magic bible Coincidentally Nothing to do with his failing small business The tough part is some dumb liberals from a nearby college tested the "magic bible oil" with their devil machine and determined it was regular old mineral oil There was no vindication no one was mad or in trouble The hysteria just silently deflated over time because otherwise the townfolk would have to think critically about whether or not they had been tricked out of their money by a fairy tale They went back to church the next Sunday Im sure,GTwebResearch,16423876680,3

ht0q5gx,s5m4up,Our town isnt small compared to most folks on here but there are less than 10000 of us Its found a bit north of a large and long highway that runs 300 miles through Virginia part of US Route 60 Most who live here make their living working with their hands farmers mechanics and the occasional businessman who trades the trek into Richmond for the cheap housing Currently there is a very prosperous logger who owns a good portion of undeveloped land throughout the county For a bit of scale on the size my house sat next to a portion of the logging land Some miles down the road was a road that divided this portion from the rest about 80 to 100 acres in total between our house and that road On the other side of that tiny road was another 800 acre stretch of land that he was planning on logging as well So all in all he had at about 900 acres ready to be logged quite possibly more as if stretched back into a part of the county unreachable by road and Im not keen on trespassing where everyone and there mother has a gun(The logging occurred when I was still in middle school so I dont have exact measurements take this with a grain of salt) He logged that land for a good while up until I was a junior in highschool I was a bit sad when it started being a kid and all If you drove by it on just the right night the moon would peak out just above and light up the edge Youd be greeted with this eerily beautiful view of nature I felt something deep for those small woods but its just trees and theyll be back one day when Im long gone Funnily enough accidents went down once they logged it so I guess I wasnt the only one whod been staring No one in town really minded the logging It was his property and he wasnt bothering no one What they were weary of was what would come after A lot of people were scared of new housing an influx of outsiders turning the quiet country into a loud suburb I never minded that idea though All those new people maybe some company would finally see reason to bring in broadband to the area And so people waited to see what would happen And waited And waited until it all just fell into the back of their minds Well imagine the shock when everyone in town gets the same thing in the mail that day A crisp white letter with bold red ink stamped by the local government I remember seeing and think it looked important as my dad went through the mail A few minutes later I heard a loud "What in the Sam Fuck" from the kitchen What was in the letter was a plan that called for the creation of a solar farm by a brand new LLC and an invitation to a public hearings that were to occur a few weeks before the project began Now for context on why people got a bit angry In 2019 the county came up with a long term plan for what the town would look like in two to three decades It included a list of objectives and what people should generally expect to happen Nowhere on there was there talk of the creation of a solar plant right next to peoples houses And this was no regular solar plant either Remember how there were over 900 acres of logged land Well 927 acres were to be used for the solar plant and this was already next to a 160 acre solar farmFor reference its recommended that plants never exceed 500 acres The logger and the LLC were also engaged in some very questionable behavior regarding zoning They knew that trying to rezone the property would most likely get rejected because of the size of the property So they instead applied for a Conditional-Use-Permit which would let them use the land however they see fit even if it did not comply with the current zoning ordinance A small part of it would also be built on a few acres of state park grounds disrupting wildlife and migration patterns During one of the hearings a ecologist came forward with findings on how that this would really fuck with the park and the animal population Most people who were upset werent upset because it was a solar plant but because it was a massive project that the company was trying to slip through the bureaucracy fast enough that no one wouldve known what was happening until it was too late The board of supervisors were also bought along with the promise that this farm would make the county a lot of money which somewhat shows because they granted the permit 5-0 It also doesnt look well that they never told the public until days before they happened So to the people of town it felt like the county and the company were conspiring against them Just so no one claims Im some far right extremist who thinks solar farms are secretly brain washing people or whatever I think solar farms are cool and a good way for clean energy,RandomHuman018,16424113230,3

ht2t0g4,s5m4up,Letchworth Village The question is whether the local Towns golf course properties should have been sold to a private developer Because in my opinion we had the perfect opportunity And we missed out on it Google "Letchworth Village" for context And please bear with me as I wrote this I got more and more heated This might get a little tl;dr Some history: Letchworth was originally an institution for the mentally and physically disabled up until the late 1990s The residents were transferred to individual group homes including my special needs uncle one of the sweetest gentlest human beings I have ever known The new system turned out to be great for the residents This Letchworth property spans hundreds of acres between the two Towns and has been on each Towns tax rolls for 10+ years with no profitability There is a private golf course mismanaged I might add Not on purpose but in my opinion - private business manages stuff better Granted thats just an opinion But the fact is that the course loses money each year and several years ago the catering hall closed up shop In the mid to late 1990s Letchworth buildings were subsequently abandoned by New York State The Towns of Stony Point and Haverstraw bought the property and currently is divided pretty much down the middle between the Towns For the rest of this Ill only refer to Stony Points side of the property The many stone buildings on the property need asbestos remediation The estimate is approximately $5 million for remediation but its probably much more because many of the buildings are currently decrepit dangerous and uninhabitable Our Chamber of Commerce has worked with both Towns to look for a suitable developer FOR YEARS - an entity with a vision not just for the property but for a plan that would integrate nicely with our area Examples: Rocking Horse Ranch Great Wolf Lodge At one point Legoland was interested but we rejected it because the traffic would have sucked (12 million more cars per year was too much) Also: Were alongside the Hudson River and the potential for tourism is huge Thats not even counting West Point and Bear Mountain 20 minutes north and a top 5 NY tourist destination SoFINALLY - we find someone Self made millionaire Lives local with family Business is local Owns the largest # of cell phone franchised stores in the Northeast Has partners that also live local and not that race matters but the partners were of diverse cultures and all family-oriented persons In my estimation it was a perfect fit for this area The developer presented a detailed plan to the Town Board His vision was to fix the buildings that ran along the main Town highways demolish the rest run the golf course profitably and build a conference center for businesses to come for retreats from NYC (35 miles from us) In addition he and his group also presented a plan for partnership with a five star hotel to occupy/ build on a portion of the property: The Ritz Carlton Multiple meetings over 25 years Traffic studies Concessions and accommodations for the Towns Justice Court Outreach to community before during and after meetings to provide public input Id say about 70% of the Town maybe morewas on board Contract negotiated posted and discussed amongst more Board meetings Sale approved And then JUN 2021: A small local environmental group (that opposes everything that takes up more electricity than a Google LED light bulb) gathers petitions to recall the vote based on their claim that "the information negotiations and contract" were done in secret Which is absolute unmitigated bullshit They flat out lied Everything was 100% transparent legal and communicated via multiple local channels and avenues in person online and more JULY 2021: A local Lawyer mounts a challenge campaign to run for Town Supervisor The Lawyer and Environmental group team up AUG: Our Chamber of Commerce allows both Developer and opposition group to speak at subsequent Chamber meetings to give a fair voice to both The Developers meeting is open respectful and provided context as well as a plan for how to finance the plan The opposition group presented an alternate vision for the property but with no plan for how to pay for it Also an argument between the Environmental group and the Lawyer broke out at the end of the meeting SEP 2021: Recall vote approved for early November Group mobilizes to convince swing voters to turn down the sale door to door emails and social media overwhelm the local residents Polarization begins NOV 2021: Voters head to the ballots and shoot down the sale Developer expectedly becomes disenchanted all the work over the past 3 years was for nothing He diplomatically exits all future negotiations So now we have no idea whats going to happen to that property next It will likely sit there with nobody interested For years Thankfully the Town Supervisor got re-elected Oh and that environmental group? We havent heard a damn peep from them since Why? Because they had no plan to begin with Except for the word "no" Ill remember that when I pay my property taxes over the next few years Tl;dr: A small group dismantled a legal multi-year transparent and beneficial effort to sell a huge Town parcel one which would have helped to transform this region for decades to come Were now back at square one Thanks,rocklandweb,16424485700,3

ht1ifdn,s5m4up,My parents live in a very rural area Their property is actually a cutout in the middle of a bunch of farmland A former owner of the farm had intended to give the property to his daughter and son-in-law for them to live on but they were not interested So my parents built a house on the land surrounded by farmland nearest neighbor is at least a hundred yards away Eventually the owner of the farm passed away and the daughter and son-in-law inherited the farm and moved in They put in an above-ground pool they had peacocks for some reason (in rural Maryland where there is currently snow on the ground) the guy even had a cannon (I think like a replica of a Civil War cannon) which he would fire off from time to time drove our dogs nuts The guy also decided that he wanted to have a pond on his property which he would build using the hill on which his house was constructed as one side of the pond He didnt get permits for this so he did all the construction/terraforming at night By the way Maryland has no natural lakes or ponds One night one side of the pond he constructed gave way and the water rushed out and flooded his field He still rebuilt the pond though Some time later he and the wife divorced and I saw her at my job (I worked at a local pharmacy as a teenager) and she went on and on about how he got the farm in the divorce even though it had been her parents farm At some point he stopped by my parents house to ask their opinion about how he was considering applying to the state to make the farm protected grasslands something like that Apparently he gets money from the state for this The land can apparently still be farmed but it can not be plowed As the conversation progresses he tells my mom how hes been getting calls from Pakistan from people with British and Pakistani accents telling him that he needs to convince President Bush to end the war in Iraq (this was pre-2008) If he doesnt answer the phone they sometimes leave a message so the Secret Service is coming to pick up his answering machine tape Some time later he got into some dire financial straits Someone came to repossess his truck so out of spite he drove the truck into his pond He was to be evicted from the property so he busted all the windows and doors out of the house The house was never repaired its been open to the weather for years and of course remains unoccupied And his peacocks are still around just roaming the area freely So if you randomly see a white peacock in rural Maryland you know why,bdinte1,16424302160,2

h1y7vhe,o0o677,Super late to the thread but I like to ask people that I recently met one of the two questions: "if you could do anything (as a job) and that would make you living what would you do?" Or "if you were given 500000 EUR with the purpose of making your dream come true how would you go about that?" I like the first one to learn about their imagination and whether or not they daydream basically You learn if they are more "realistic" or more "creative" person It also helps them maybe redirect their course of life closer to what they wish for it to be even if ever so slightly The second one has a similar role with a twist: often time you (can) help them learn that they dont really need a lot of money to at least start on making their dream come true Most people are apparently very humble about their dreams I dont know I like to serve both of these questions in a fairly casual way and they work best that way So people dont get a sense that they need to say something noble or fancy I just want to learn who you are,DexDawg,16238359090,2

hpmnlrh,rm3qcl,Pretty late comment so I doubt anyone is going to read this story but it has stuck with me my entire life and I still think about it from time to time We used to have a girl in my class Jordan who was severely overweight and autistic Kids being as ruthless as they are always picked on her for being different Instead of "yo mamas so fat" jokes theyd say "Jordans so fat" among other cruel things Whenever shed get frustrated with them she would hide her face in her shirt and cry Well the reason why she was overweight was because weight gain was a side effect of the medication she had to take for her autism but most kids were too naive to care or understand I was one of the few people who felt sorry for her and understood her because my brother has autism We sat next to each other in 4th grade and I would help her out with her school work if she was confused and would reassure her that things would be okay in times of trouble She then saw me as an ally and would show me her drawings and the good grades that she would get from time to time Id always give her compliments for both After that year I never saw her again That summer between 4th and 5th grade she came down with a rare disease and was hospitalized To this day I still dont know exactly what it was But she ended up profusley bleeding into her stomach and puking it all out She died within five hours from blood loss Only about 20 kids from our entire class came to the funeral It kinda pissed me off but I assume most of them who didnt come did not feel welcome because they were ashamed of the way they treated her When I got there and saw a few of my peers the select few of us who accepted her for who she was standing in front of her coffin I joined them It was open casket We all stood in silence I guarantee none of us have forgotten that moment Ten years old seeing one of our peers lifeless I mean she looked lifeless The mortician tried their best to use makeup but her body was so pale that you couldnt hide it It was a traumatizing sight The whole thing was just so sad A few weeks later her mom had a garage sale to sell most of Jordans stuff Partly because it pained her mom to see her things around the house and partly because her mom needed the money after the hospital bills and the funeral She worked as a dishwasher for the high school so it wasnt the best paying job When I got to talking with her mom and she realized my name she started bawling She told me that Jordan talked about me all the time at home I was her closest friend in our classroom that past year She thanked me for being her friend and hugged me for what felt like an eternity and I didnt mind at all She took me inside and let me look at Jordans drawings in a sketchbook (her mom didnt sell that for obvious reasons) and I stumbled upon a drawing she made of me and her sitting at our desks with big smiley faces I couldnt fight back the tears Her mom rubbed my shoulder and cried with me We sat for a few hours and her mom told me countless stories of her late daughter I enjoyed listening to them I got to know her better and it made me beileve knowing those stories that a part of her will live on in my memory When I left her mom let me keep the drawing she made of us I still have it to this day The whole thing was quite a traumatic experience for everyone in my grade But I guess in the long run it brought us together as a class It opened our eyes to the blatant fact that we bullied a kid and now shes dead After that realization we all had an unspoken understanding that it was wrong and wed never do it again All the way up to graduation we never had a single fight within my class Everyone was just so nice to each other Even though we had our cliques any one of us could sit down at anybodys table during lunch and wed let them jump in the conversation Rest her innocent beautiful soul Her untimely death inadvertently brought peace and understanding to our entire class,Xenomorph02,16402216160,249

hpmpdro,rm3qcl,Ok buckle up Some backstory I grew up in a small town in the 90s very rural the same classmates I had in grade 4 being over 60% of the same I had in highschool later on We were so boonies that we had a "drive your tractor to school day" so yeah small town I had small cases of bullying that are typical of kids being dumb kids but it was right when puberty hit us all like a metric ton of bricks that it got bad I was a wierd kid had ADHD and couldnt exactly make good conversation Plus when I was growing up we didnt make tons of money so I never got to see the new buzz on the TV because we couldnt afford Cable TV or see the newest movies everyone was talking about so was always on the outside of the newest trends of conversation I wasnt very athletic but liked to read books so I fell in with the wierd kids crowd and rejects but the punks and goths were their own cliche that were gatekeeping liking music so it was really awkward for me I felt kinda alone Now to the story: I had a serious case of bullying when I was in my junior highschool days Going to school on certain days was stressful and I was targeted by one individual in particular well call Steve Steve wasnt the most popular guy but he fit in with everyone But found me an easy target since it was a known fact that I was the weird kid in class but Steve turned it up to 11 There were verbal assaults calling me homophobic slurs make fun of my clothes a litany of things that were daily or weekly occurrences But one thing in particular stands out In 8th or 9th grade came a huge assault Steve cornered me at my locker before a shared math class I didnt know if this was going to be a hard day or easy day for me but typically when Steve came to my locker which was an especially rare occurrence it was going to be really hard But instead Steve asked to borrow a calculator and was incredibly nice about it I was a nice guy meek husky but constantly trying to make friends so of course I let him borrow my calculator I had a backup anyway The whole math class I wasnt bothered once and I smiled inwardly hoping that this was a small sign of the winds changing We split classes afterwards so I didnt expect it back for at least a day (we had homeroom together so Id ask then) I went on the rest of the day without seeing Steve but hopeful that I scored points so I wrote it off The next day I got to school early ready to ask about my calculator and what I got was both unexpected and psychologically unhealthy Steve had defaced my calculator He had dug into its cover into its sides into the battery cover (it was one of those old snap cover calculators that came in blue or purple) it had all been defaced with a colorful acronym: SLAPOS he started calling me that instead of my name showing the whole homeroom what he had done an loudly with attention gaining fervor let everyone present know that SLAPOS stood for SMELLS LIKE A PIECE OF SHIT HE CALLED ME THAT FOR THE REST OF THE SCHOOL YEAR That whole day I blocked out but was basically Steve spreading the great word of SLAPOS Other kids in our class started calling me that and laughing along I had no outlet I had no one to tell really I didnt stand up for myself I just rode it out for the rest of the year whatever was left of it Steve wherever you are I have recovered I became a productive member of society I have friends whom I trust and children that I love I have nothing to prove to you nor will I ever but in my hear of hearts I hope your circumstances have turned you into a better human being And if not I hope you have to travel a mile barefoot on broken glass covered in lemon juice and salt heal then do it again TL;DR I had a bully deface my calculator with a colorful name and got called that the rest of the school year,Lucid_Viking,16402224680,2

The lady starts to help us out and the guy says "*Ive got it from here*" to her He then tells me that no one has notified him of this and that it is impossible Tells us that we have to go across town to JiffyLube get the oil changed and it would be covered under their business account with them I ask why I cant get a new car The nice lady said they had cars available and was very understanding He proceeds to tell me I dont know what Im talking about and that he is the manager and he knows his store in and out like the back of his hand I tell him I dont want to wait at JiffyLube for an hour He says we should have checked the oil life before we rented the car I tell him thats absurd its a rental Thats not my job He then tells me "You can go and get the oil changed or you can keep driving the car and Ill report this incident and if anything happens to the car you have to pay damages" I say "how is that possible or legal you rented me a car that needs maintainaince and are telling me I have to do it or pay for not my car" He said yes I literally said "Okay snowflake" then started walking away As I was walking away he said something I didnt catch We get to JiffyLube explain to the gentleman that it is a rental car and we are from Hertz The lube tech says "yeah (whatever the dudes name was at Hertz) called and said you guys would be here Ill get it done soon as I can" Then the lube tech proceeded to make a cup of coffee and eat for 15 minutes Took over an hour to do an oil change with no cars lined up before ours Then best of all HE CHARGED US FOR IT I said "the guy at Hertz said if we come here its free because they have an account with you guys" He said "they do but (the douche flute at Hertz) said there was an altercation therefore the company doesnt have to pay" I was like "what the hell I called him a snowflake and now I have to pay for an oil change on a rental car?" He says hes just doing his job I call Hertz Flagstaff Douche flute answered I say "so Im at JiffyLube and the guy informed me that I have to pay for the oil change due to an incident" He immediately says "you disrespected me youre lucky Im even talking to you now" I ask him "so because a customer said something that wasnt nice to you you are going to back out of a deal your company has with them? just to make me pay money out of my pocket FOR NOT MY CAR Is this so I learn a lesson?" He says "well you should learn something from this" I said "yeah never to rent from Hertz again And that you are an official snowflake I said something you got offended and make me suffer because of it Is this your first day in customer service? I deal with this for a living at my restaurant" He raised his voice and started to tell me how I have no respect and need to pay consequences for my actions I cut him off and said "Im not raising my voice why are you taking this personally" He hung up I went back inside and looked at the bill $85 for a Buick Encore oil change Its a fucking 2 liter engine I change all my oil on my own cars 85 is wack he used their "top teir" oil Better than what the car recommended Because "Thats the oil that Hertz tells us to use" So we ate our losses I paid the 85 since it was "my fault" We call Hertz 800 number and ask them for the lady that was helping us a few hours ago on the phone They connected us we explained to her what happened in detail I straight up told her "I called the dude a snowflake so we couldnt change cars and had to pay for the oil change" They told us they were sorry for the inconvenience and that they would mail us vouchers for that happening We go on the rest of our trip no more problems We return the car no problems We get 400 dollars in voucher coupons from Hertz corporate All is okay I guess We got the enough for a rental next trip SO WE FUCKING THOUGHT 2 weeks later we get a letter from Flagstaff Hertz saying that my mother (who rented the car) is banned for life from Hertz and their affiliates due to circumstances with our last rental BEST YET The letter states "All vouchers you recieved from corporate are now void" (because they had my moms name on them) Signed: douche flute himself FUCK HERTZ LIGMA BALLS,my-mind-is-my-enemy,16270838410,3
h6b7cz0,oq0qjx,I will forever boycott The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints aka Mormon church It is a $13000000000000 business fronting as a church That number is their investment amount in ensign peak that number doesnt include all their real estate ranches other businesses or incoming tithing Also they have been reported to the IRS about the ensign peak investment because they are growing it tax free under some charity law BUT they have violated that law by not using ANY of it for charity Also their false prophets told their lds members in Africa to pay 10% tithing to them and that God will bless them for it by getting them out of poverty It is a brainwashing cult that imprisons the minds of its members I was raised in this cult and in my brainwashed foolishness I paid them 10% of all my money since I was about 8 years old (birthday money) until I was 34 years old (income) Even as an adult living in poverty using government snap benefits to buy food to eat and health insurance for having babies and kids I still payed them 10% of my low income!!!! Why? Because I was brainwashed by them that paying tithing to them would get me out of poverty BUT they also told me I had to be a stay at home mom to get their god to bless me cuz that is where their god wants all women Fuck them for holding me back financially!!!! Fuck them for keeping me mentally imprisoned and poisoning my mind against all outside influences that told me they were a cult Fuck them for teaching me toxic positivity Fuck them for teaching me people pleasing Fuck them for teaching me to stay at home and not have a job Fuck them for telling me to have babies asap even if we couldnt afford them Fuck them for all the spiritual trauma Fuck them for lying about all of it Fuck them for cult temple rituals which included conventing to GIVE them EVERYTHING which God has bless me with Fuck them for the cult temple rituals to covent to obey my husband Fuck them for not providing informed consent before entering the temple and making any of their convents Fuck them for teaching me the man is the head of the home so I was to deferred to him even when it wasnt in our families best interests Fuck them for whitewashing their past Fuck them for lying about their past Fuck them for not living up to the standards of honesty and integrity they demanded of me Fuck them for not living up to any of the standards they taught me to live by Fuck them for telling all its members to get married and start having babies right away even if you cant afford them and college isnt finished Fuck them for telling me that if I left the church I would be under Satans power and he would destroy me I hope the IRS will fine them to pay back the government food and insurance programs the poverty mormons have been using and make them return all the fraudulently obtained money to 1st-all the poverty members who paid tithing and it should include the interest it earned while in their care and 2nd mayne then on from there until all of that fraudulently obtained money is returned to the people they took it from I have a good job now and we no longer qualitify for government assistance except insurance for two of my kids I am bettering myself I am seeking therapy to help me move on from the immense harm (which I barely touched upon in this post) done to me by that business fronting as a church I have blossomed much over these last 5 years since I have left that controlling cult I have a beautiful garden I have always wanted My house is actually becoming a home with beautiful things I enjoy My relationships with my kids and spouse is a billion times better now,to_know_this_love,16270851450,3

I dont even know where to start with Nestl They stole water from villages and areas that are under droughts and water shortages They have gotten into legal fights with multiple areas because they wanted to take water and force the citizens to start reducing their own water usage so they could continue using their water One of their higher-ups has claimed that water is not a human right There are other crimes that I cant remember but "water is not a human right" was enough to get me to stop using their products,random-shit-writing,16270900310,3

This is a Starbucks customers arent gonna care if Im wearing a collared shirt Guys I know they like to pretend they have a monopoly on the coffee shop market but they dont! If you live in a decently sized urban or suburban area in my experience its usually easy to find a decent local cafe or coffee shop to get your coffee at which probably has lower prices and better coffee and plus youll be supporting local businesses that deserve your money more than Starbucks does in the first place Edit: I currently work at a small local coffee chain in the Bay Area and let me tell you the change was absolutely insane with how different things felt,scary-levinstein,16270588740,2

h6ah1qj,oq0qjx,Im super late to this and I doubt anyone will see my response but I didnt see anyone mention Monsanto Theyre as evil and destructive as nestle but for some reason they arent talked about as much Monsanto is an agribusiness giant thats owned by bayer (Bayer bought them in 2017 but they first started working together before WW2 I believe) It started in 1901 making chemical food additives and flavors Saccharine was their biggest product around that time By the 30s it was involved more in agrochemicals They created and mass produced PCBs a double whammy of carcinogenic and harmful environmental pollutant These were banned decades ago but because they take so long to break down they are still in the environment today They created a chemical that was later used by Dow chemical (a parent company of chemours which I hate almost as much) to create agent orange In 1945 Monsanto saw the success of DDT in WW2 and started mass producing it for farmers to use For all of these you could argue that they didnt realize the devastating effects they would have on people and the environment But these arent even the things that I really hate them for Monsanto really likes GMO crops Dont get me wrong Im not a person who thinks GMO=evil its their business model for gmos that are evil They began making high yield pest/disease resistant crops and patenting them They would then sell these to farmers to use with contracts Without a contract with Monsanto you cannot grow them to sell the crop as they were patented These contracts were also only for the seeds you originally bought so harvesting seeds from your own crops was also a violation And Monsanto took these crimes very seriously because if people could get a few of their patents for free how could they possibly make any profit as a giant national corporation Now if you know anything about how plants reproduce youll realize that its impossible to keep seeds from spreading to nearby areas So farmers living near contracted Monsanto farmers would often unknowingly be growing a few of their patented seeds If Monsanto realized patent violation was happening they would take the farmer to court and bury these often small family owned farms in lawsuits and fines Monsanto also created roundup in the 70s which is now known to cause cancer If Im not mistaken they have known and hidden that fact for a long time But theyve made quite a few herbicides and pesticides that their seeds can handle being sprayed with and almost all other crops cannot So a farmer using dicamba (one of the biggest herbicides causing yield problems) on their soybeans from Monsanto can spray it aerially saving lots of time and money And the neighbour down the road gets dicamba drifting into their non-monsanto crop from the wind killing many and vastly reducing their own yield This has also made many small farms across America go under Over the last 50 years Monsanto has almost completely killed off small farms so that almost all produce grown in America is made by giant companies oftentimes ones that work with them and buy their products,Deerlybehooved,16270722530,2

Also advice to pet owners Take proper care of your pet! Call at the FIRST sign of illness even if this means you might have to cancel the appointment later because trust me well fill it And be prepared for long ER wait times Dont sit on an issue for a couple hours and then go to the ER Get yourself in line at the ER and then think about if you need to be there or not Its a scary time for animals be on top of things! I also recommend getting set up as a client with a regular vet if you dont have one Clinics will squeeze in their own clients before non clients And finally please have some compassion for the people trying to HELP your animals If the pandemic has proven one thing its that we are indeed NOT in it for the money If we were we all would have walked out by now,Lynn4562756,16323073910,3

What can they do? My best advice is to travel to a different region of the US while immunocompromised during a pandemic to get some treatment Then travel back home and start chemotherapy during a pandemic This assumes they have the money / insurance / etc to travel to a different state HUGE assumption Otherwise its just watch wait hope and treat symptoms We dont have beds we dont have ventilators we dont have ICU nurses / RTs we dont have the things that let us help people People are stuck at hospitals that dont feel comfortable treating their problems (especially for trauma) A colleague called me about an intracranial hemorrhage late last night to see if I thought the patient would do okay if they went home with a responsible adult We dont have any beds to monitor them we have to limit use of what resources we have I thought it would probably be fine Hell even if the guy did get worse and had to go to the OR we dont have an ICU bed to send him to hed sit in PACU for a day or two then get discharged home nowhere close to my standard of care But thats where we are trying new things because we literally cant do what we think is best,TheDentateGyrus,16322735120,2

h8xqcxf,p47gki,Greed Almost everything else on this thread (climate change oceanic ecosystem collapse disease etc) has the means to fight it or the knowledge/ research techniques necessary to develop them "Green technology" has been around for decades I mean Jimmy Carter installed solar cells on the roof of the White House (which afaik Reagan took down) Sustainable agriculture plant based diets (as both a disease reducer and decreasing the need for water and land used for animal feed) and water recycling have been in vogue to small degrees since at least the 1950s So why arent these things more broadly adopted or known about? Greed Corporate interests dont want better ways of doing things because it threatens their bottom line Its simply cheaper to invest in propaganda (through political donations manipulating education materials paying for museums funding misleading documentaries failing to educate the public or advertise better products etc) than it is to invest in improving their products to be better and more efficient and sell them Public corporate law favors maximizing revenue on a quarterly basis - to do otherwise threatens the security of the company employees in the eyes of the shareholders From this perspective its best to make as much money as possible right now than to invest in a sustainable future because otherwise the job of the CEO and other execs becomes threatened Unless a powerful CEO can make a very strong case for it there is simply no financial or career incentive to invest in green technology There are a lot of factors threatening the planet and a lot of stupidity enabling it to continue But the thing preventing solutions from manifesting at scale is greed: desire for short-term profits above all else Plain and simple Greed is what will kill us all,hatchway,16289642640,2

She didnt even say it with malice she just said it casually Like had she of said something else in the same tone it would have seemed pleasant Its like they dont acknowledge that youre human The worst bit is whatever it was was probably worth more than my monthly salary But she doesnt get 50% off DC shoes so she can suck on those apples,Je_me_rends,16274551760,446

h6tnjq5,ot0pdk,I worked for two completely different types of rich One was about my age (back then early-30s) who got filthy rich with real estate building apartement-complexes and selling them We initially met because we were doing the roofing for the mansion he built for himself and his then girlfriend in a rather wealthy neighbourhood After the building was finished a few months later she decided that the pool wasnt big enough So he bought the neighbours house to his left hired an architect and a construction company tore down the house that was standing there and build her a huge pool area to her liking A few months after everything was finished they broke up A few weeks later he had a new girlfriend She didnt like the pool area So he bought the neighbours house to the right hired an architect and a company tore the house down and build her a pool area to her liking while refurbishing the one he already had so he could meet his buddies there having a drink and a BBQ while watching football games Guess what? He broke up with this girlfriend even before the new pool area was done Around comes girlfriend #3 they stay together everything is fine they even marry and she gets pregnant with his first child Turns out she is an overprotective mum that doesnt want any hazards for their kids in their home So he had to tear down the pools and turn them into a garden/playground This happened all over the course of three years and cost more than Im going to make in my lifetime The other one was an older gentleman maybe late 60s/early 70s He lived in a bogstandard row house in a working class neighbourhood and hired us to repair some roof tiles after a hailstorm in the area Nothing really nothing screamed money about him He rather looked like a retired high school janitor After we were done and ready to leave he gave us a 5 tip and asked whether I could come the next day to inspect some of his other buildings and give him a price for the repairs Since it involved a lot of driving he picked me up at my office in a 20 year old VW Golf The kind of car youd buy your kid as their first car because theyre rather inexpensive but kind of reliable He drove me from one building to the next Malls office buildings supermarkets apartment buildings and stuff Turns out back in the day he was a rather successfull engineer holding several patents that are still making him big money from big corps He was bored in his retirement so he started buying/building and renting out real estate As a hobby His kids all went to university without him paying a single dime for them They had to work while studying and are now well off on their own He told me he doesnt need any luxury or cares much about *having* money But he enjoys *making* it And donates what he doesnt spend every year Needless to say he is to this day one of our best customers By now he isnt even asking for an offer he just orders And he still drives this old VW Golf and still wears the same worn out clothes I even doubt he actually owns a suit since he is wearing the same shabby clothes to his topping out ceremonies even when there are VIP-guests present,Quietschedalek,16274758030,34

h6t1syi,ot0pdk,A lot comments here talking very much about the materialistic things they rich use or buy I would like to comment more about the mentality Ive worked with wealthy families for quite some time now and the biggest thing I can say is that "wants are always met" If the child sees a cool toy in a commercial for a split second The next day it is there If a rich person is buying a product They are always buying the best version and all the possible accessories If they sit down at a restaurant they are not leaving until every item on the menu that interested them during the perusing has been tried on the table The biggest thing Ive learned working with the rich is that "comfort has no value" Every single thing in the houses I work in works Works the first time Everything is so comfortable and convenient This is where much of the money goes Comfort has no value Edit: by "comfort has no value" I mean it has no monetary value As one redditor said its priceless If a rich person wants to be comfortable the price is not there,Insanopatato,16274587970,35

h6vu4vb,ot0pdk,Does dating count as having to cater to someone? It sure felt like he thought I was more of a slave than a partner I dated this super rich guy for 3 months this summer (worst idea ever)- and boy did I learn some bizarre shit about how they live Like apparently after hed get wasted and do too much coke at horse races (who goes to horse races?!?!) hed have a nurse come over the next day and give him a saline IV for his hangovers instead of just drinking Gatorade and taking Tylenol like a normal person I know that the service cost several hundred dollars but he didnt tell me how much exactly He was in his late 20s and his mom still bought all his clothes for him I dont think hed ever lived without a maid cleaning up after him-He dropped a glass in his room and broke it and didnt clean it up for two months because he legit didnt know how to clean anything He didnt do his laundry for 6 months (he had *that many* clothes) and then I had to help him pile like 10 garbage bags full of clothes into the back of his car and take them to the laundromat show him how to operate the washers etc and then force him to put them away so they didnt just sit in a pile taking up *literally* half his room (The pile was bigger than his bed) He was so sensitive to any sort of discomfort that he would act like he was going to have a panic attack if he was required to have a direct conversation about any sort of conflict even minor issues like calling the internet company about an outage Sometimes I had to order for him at restaurants if it was something more exotic than steaks and hamburgers Hed just make this pleading panicked face at me - He was so used to having things done for him he didnt even know how to ask for help And he never thanked anyone It was expected He literally didnt know basic shit about life like how to apply for an apartment I had to help him and he didnt realize you had to ask questions like "is the water included in rent?" He didnt even know what was a realistic amount of money to pay for rent He ended up drunkenly sexually assaulting me and then ghosting me and when I ran into him two months later and was like "what the fuck dude?!?" He said hes "not required to acknowledge someone whos spoken to him in an angry tone" and his texts to me sounded more like a PR release than the way youd speak to someone you dated - Im 99% sure he paid somebody with legal background to help him write them He told me he had done that before in another incident when he got in trouble for something in high school (He didnt tell me what it was he got in trouble for) I wish I could hire a PR agent every time I did something stupid while I was drunk I didnt even want to out him or report him to the cops or anything I just wanted him to apologize and acknowledge that maybe he needed to stop being so fucked up on Addies and booze all the time because thats how this kind of shit happens He said I was being unreasonable and its not his fault because he "didnt experience it that way" He called it a "mental health boundary" to ghost me after he assaulted me because he "couldnt handle the stress" of being held accountable for his actions I think I mightve actually been the first person who ever told him to his face that he did some thing wrong His attitude was just "well it happened I dont know what you expect me to do now"Generally that was how he acted whenever he upset someone or made a mistake He thought that his family was "middle class" because they didnt own multiple yachts like his neighbors and would argue with normal people about that being unfair Like his family had a big ass house out in the county and multiple vacation properties but he *needed* us to know how hard it was for his dad to not be Jeff Bezos We had a really embarrassing (for him) conversation where I had to make him look up the median income for the United States at which point he realized his family was in like the top 3% of incomes in the country He moved into this warehouse I live at (thats how we met) pretending to be broke (He kept a second 2 bedroom apartment in a really nice neighborhood that was like $2000/mo) because he knew people wouldnt like him if they knew he had a rich family and he "wanted the life experience" He was basically LARPing as a poor person so he could feel like he understood how real life works I didnt know until two months into dating him how well off his family actually was (he hid it) and he would go on rants about how its actually way harder to be a rich kid because your parents will be upset if you date poor people He wanted to hide me from all his rich friends and his family because he thought they were disinherit him for dating me He had one of those expensive $500/hr psychs that would tell him what he wanted to hear and prescribe him anything he asked for - he was frequently strung out on Adderall I mean like he was being prescribed three times what anybody who actually needs it as prescribed his psych was clearly just pay for play It would have been way cheaper to just do meth He also armchair diagnosed himself and all his rich friends with autism so he could claim that all their sociopathic behavior was because they had mental illness and therefore nobody could be upset at them for acting the way they did Generally speaking for him and his rich guy friends mental health was an excuse to act how they wanted For everyone else any sort of mental health issues meant that we were insane and not to be taken seriously no matter what we said He insisted that his life was the worst because he didnt have to do anything to survive and he could just drift through life "his existence was meaningless" and therefore "he had it way harder than everybody else" Hed often cry about it to all of us (Mind you this was during the pandemic when most of us had just been fired and people in my building were being evicted for missing rent) Like this guy had really convinced himself he was a victim of society and it was our responsibility to let him act however he wanted because it was so hard for him What a piece of work Shit gives me such a headache Im going to need to call my personal assistant to come over here and give me an IV drip about it ,LostInIndigo,16275098700,29

h6ux29k,ot0pdk,Im a Realtor in Seattle was helping a student of UW that was from Japan find a condo for in the area Nice kid good English (believe he was in the Medical Field) One of the times I met with him I accidentally handed him the wrong folder which contents were for a very wealthy Facebook executive which had about 4-5 different houses all atleast $3mm He opens the folder and says he wants to check one of the properties out (in my experience hes wasting our time as he said he was only looking for about $800k) Hes a nice kid and its not far away so I agree and we go check it out The minute we step in to the backyard thats overlooking Lake Washington he says "how much do we need to offer to get this in contract today?" I am in shock as I assumed his dad was just buying him a condo to live in while over here for college I ask him how he would finance it and he says "give me a minute" Comes back 5 minutes later and shows me an email from his father with a screen shot of his bank account - this was an entire list of bank accounts (maybe 15-20) with the account number crossed out The lowest amount of money he had in 1 of his accounts was $9MM Needless to say we bought the house and a few weeks later he calls me and says he needs some help can you come over? Which is an odd request but this kid just brought in about 20% of my yearly profit so I have to go I walk in the house and he has a couple of his neighbors in the house The kid greets me and says "we have all come to an agreement of terms for the sale of my neighbors homes" - all the neighbors smile and said "all we need you to do is write up the contracts and well give you a 1% commission for each house" just for writing up the contract Of course I agreed and brought out my laptop and started gathering info that they had previously agreed upon The neighbor on the left of the house he previously bought had agreed to sell his home for $36MM and the neighbor on the right had agreed on $49MM (he had just completely remodeled his entire home) I write up the contracts and we send it over to escrow and go about our business I later asked him why he was buying them and he said the remodeled house was for his parents to visit and the other house on the left is for Family to come visit They had just spent $11MM in 1 month just for a place to stay a week or two a year I still help him buy 2-3 properties a year where they just buy in cash and dont do anything with it and just let it sit Obviously frustrating with the housing crisis but I know where my breads buttered,trigtor206,16274958060,23

h6sndgp,ot0pdk,I posted this story a long time ago Ill copy and paste it here know a lady who has one of the lifetime first class passes on American She has a house in Hawaii and wanted to fly to a city on the mainland but she doesnt like first class from Hawaii because she had a bad experience one time So no problem she can use her NetJets private jet But she doesnt want to pay for it So She arranges to make another large donation to her alma mater (she already donated between 10-20 million and has her name on an entire school "The so-and-so School of Whatever") and so she calls the president of the university makes the arrangements and suggests that they gave an event for this donation Just so happens a decent number of other wealthy alumns live in Hawaii so why dont they all fly over for the event on a larger private jet and oh by the way the university should cover the cost of the charter I write this in present tense (sort of) because the arrangements are currently being made TL;DR- lady makes huge donation to university out of spite to avoid flying first class or on her own private jet TL;DR 2 - future generations of college students will be studying using facilities paid for out of spite all because some first class flight attendant a decade ago spilled some peanuts or something EDIT2: Lots of discussion about her motivation for all this Ill clarifyfrom what I can tell it has nothing to do with generosity or a desire just for a free flight Heres a clarification from farther down the thread My impression based on her telling me this story is this She wont fly American Airlines out of Hawaii even though she flies first class for free because she "had a bad experience" once a long time ago (Keep in mind shell fly American other places just not out of Hawaii) So her alternative is to use one of her NetJets planes But why should she pay for a charter when its really the fault of American Airlines?! So lets see what can she do hmm Oh I know Lets get someone else to pay for the charter How abouther alma mater with which she has an excellent relationship already So she has her office call the president of this university and say shed like to make another donation Some arrangements are made some other people get involved a whole lot of running around is done by her people the universitys people the offices of these other wealthy alums etc Hell even my employees will eventually spend some time on this selling some of her positions to get the cash Ultimately she doesnt have to fly American she doesnt have to spend her money (this is a matter of principle not!!! economics) she gets a "free" flight out of Hawaii on a larger jet than she otherwise likely would have with no more effort than spending a few minutes on a phone that someone handed her Whats the downside? Granted shes spending a lot more money to do this but it is (as Ive said) literally of no concern Another thing to keep in mind obviously she told me this in a very different tone that Im relaying it here lol,pudding7,16274478340,328

h6trmqy,ot0pdk,Oh man I have some stories I used to work as a florist for a super high end flower shop in a very large North Texas city that only dealt with the richest of the rich I was the mobile field guy and our shop had contracts with some of the ultra wealthy to send someone by every other day to their houses to freshen up or change out fresh flowers in their foyers ballrooms bathrooms etc To give you an idea of the level of wealth we did with a certain owner of a certain North Texas NFL football team was on my weekly rotation as well as a certain NBA team owner and "shark" was a common stop too It was kind of cool you were almost always just a fly on the wall in the lives of the rich and famous Because I had to go to each house every 2-3 days it was easy to eavesdrop and chat and enjoy basically what amounted to a real life TLC reality show First thing I learned is that there is a **HUGE** difference between old money folks like the football team owner and new money folks like the basketball team owner Old money people are super fucking weird They dont talk to "the help" much and let their property managers or whomever deal with us but they are so used to having staff around they dont give a shit and you see and hear a lot Everything is super stuffy and pompous Everyone is so insanely obsessed with their social standing who knows who and who has the nicest this or that If one person on the block buys a new boat everyone else has to buy a slightly nicer boat or if someones wife in the neighborhood gets a new Porsche everybodys wife is getting a new Porsche I shit you not one time I was hired to do flowers for a BBQ at a rich guys house he had some neighborhood friends over I overheard some of the men arguing about what brand of luxury car one of the guys was going to get his wife because the others said once he did they would have to get one for their wives as well Most of them are all unhappy in their marriages and fucking each other in every manner Husbands hooking up with other wives wives hooking up with other husbands husbands hooking up with other husbands bored wives or kids home from school hooking up with staff members or people that came through to work in or on the house Staff members fucking each other Just eveybody fucking everybody Its super entertaining watching them all fight for social status and trying to act better than each other when in most cases theyve all probably snorted cocaine off each others asses and fucked within the last month The more pious and holy a man in those circles acts the more certain it is hes fucking teenage girls and the happier a woman claims to be in her marriage the more dirty damp and deep shes getting from every young pool guy and landscaper she fancies A lot of the time rich parents will "strongly suggest" by giving or withholding financial help in return for compliance from their sons and daughters to marry each other to either keep wealth within tight circles or uphold some bloodline or stupid shit like that So they will get married to whoever their parents want and then hook up with everybody else in the neighborhood They also abuse prescription drugs like nobodys business they pop Xanax like candy and cocaine use is rampant There is nothing like spending an hour trying to get some flowers done while some rich guys housewife hopped up on cocaine to try and get some relief from the boredom rants about her life for an hour Basically if you watch Schitts Creek the majority of old money people are like real life versions of the Rose family but with abundant access to cocaine xanax and viagra New money people are typically the opposite from old money people Most are super down to earth and treat you well and live pretty normal lives just with a lot more money Some are super snobby and douchey but most are really laid back and chill Like they have this attitude of fuck it I made it I never have to worry about anything again They tend not to air their dirty laundry in front of the staff and some but not all will chat with you The new money folks tend to be a lot more frugal though which is understandable But I liked working with them quite a bit more A lot of new money folks were focused much more on just enjoying being home and not working as much so a lot of them had really cool hobbies and its interesting to see how normal people who get rich spend their money One guy had an entire barn full of classic motorcycles Another had the biggest LEGO collection Ive ever seen anywhere including the Internet One had a massive home theater with a gigantic projector screen and every single video game console and probably every game ever made Most were really eager to talk about and share their hobbies which was nice New money people are always either happily married or divorced and in some stage of partying The happily married folks were usually pretty calm but the single and single folks had some wild events and scandalous drama that could compete Another complicating factor is that there is a very real and often physical degree of separation from most of the ultra wealthy and the rest of the world In the city where I worked the ultra wealthy lived in huge gated communities compromised of walled gated complexs with multiple houses and guest houses on each property where the HOA required yearly proof that you had a bank account with at least $500k in it These neighborhoods often have tall sturdy brick walls surrounding them with a few hundred feet of gardens around the interior just so you have as little chance of seeing or hearing the peasants outside as possible They have their own grocery stores their own clothing and department stores restaurants bars car dealerships hairdressers jeweler schools daycares dentists you name it All with the same formula to cater only to the rich for every need and desire of day to day life without ever having to interact with the general public They can go months or years without ever having to speak with or even be in the same room with someone from outside the upper class For this reason a lot of them are very extremely disconnected with the real world and sometimes its comical sometimes it was scary Like I would often get $100 tips not because they wanted to be nice but they genuinely thought that $100 was just the standard tip for

h6wn94s,ot0pdk,Im a poker player playing in a private poker game in Australia Everyone is Chinese heritage except me I was nice to the right guy once and got invited We usually play 25/50 or about a 5k buyin A new guy comes one day driving a Pikachu Lamborghini He loses 70k in a few hours and the host takes him outside and seconds later we hear laughing They get back in and I ask him whats so funny The host apparently asked him if he wanted to take a break saying losing 70k in one day is a lot of money He laughed and said losing 700k in a day wouldnt bother him True enough over the course of a few weeks he got a bit better at poker but still lost close to a million but seemed more content to come and hang out and have a few beers A lot of really rich guys like poker I find because they get treated normally by the players We all take the piss out of each other and I think its a nice break from a worldthat blows smoke up your ass,aryaisthegoat,16275238510,10
h6st61v,ot0pdk,Used to work with wealthy people all the time Starting out at one of trumps golf courses Most people are crabby and their marriages suck Then i became a handyman for an extremely wealthy family Their property was beautiful and I loved the gig Generally nice people Typical issues I saw were identity crisis holes filled with constant shopping on Amazon There was a lot of keeping up with the Joneses going on They had a full time nanny and cleaning lady as well The Father was generally absent and apathetic Once he commented how hot his business associates new girlfriend was (50m 20f) at the start of a long car ride with me and the wife The kids however were some of the brightest and cheery people Ive ever met I used to drive the son 2 hours to his high school and would be blown away at his maturity and intelligence At his age I only cared about two things and neither of which were books Bottom line: money doesnt give you happiness It does give a damn good education and upbringing though,joenastyness,16274517940,51
h6t1q97,ot0pdk,I used to do residential electrical mostly million-dollar-plus homes Can confirm: money can buy pretty much anything except good taste and common sense Rich people will spend stoopid amounts of money on pets especially On one home we installed several Decora-style switches (the flat ones that you press top or bottom) about a foot off the floor in several spots throughout the home so the precious doggo could turn lights on with their nose in the middle of the night because they were afraid of the dark She also paid through the nose for us to move remove or add those switches several times during the build Another lady got a dog ceiling fan Supposedly someplace took her (likely heavily sedated) mongrel and used lasers to create a 3-D model of the wretched thing then cast the mini-mongrel replicas in gold-covered bronze Those were then stuck onto a gold-plated ceiling fan with exotic wood blades and designer glass for the lamps It remains the ugliest and most difficult-to-install ceiling fan Ive ever encountered Another family got a company that normally builds specialty food-service appliances to design a water dispenser for Fido Motion-activated so it would fill automatically then dump the used water after a delay and sterilize with UV-light Bottled water delivered twice a week We had a dedicated outlet with its own circuit just to power the thing Lots of crazy rich ladies loooove their pets,3LlamasInATrenchCoat,16274587310,23
h6t4e2r,ot0pdk,This isnt that extravagant in comparison to some of the other stories but I worked for a vets office in a very wealthy area I worked upstairs reception and scheduled (among other things) dog daycare/boarding/grooming The daycare clients often brought us treats (we usually had Starbucks most days someone bought me a brand new pair of Converse because I said I liked theirs I got a brand new Marc Jacobs purse etc) but our favorite was this prominent elderly lawyer who had a bulldog he just LOVED Hed come in each Friday and tip everyone upstairs who had a part in taking care of his special boy $100 bills Sometimes it would be $20 each if he was in a rush (and he always apologized about it) but often it was $100 a person The money wasnt why we loved him - it was just the two of them and how much he loved that dog and how much the dog loved him was extremely evident and it was adorable They were both just so happy and sweet just them entering the room lifted everyones spirits I also had a few times where I had to drop daycare dogs off to owners (because they were "too busy" to come often for absurd reasons but whatever) even though it wasnt a service we offered those of us that were "close" to the clients or preferred by the clients would be asked to do so Theyd just throw money at you as a thanks it was wild Especially because I lived less then 10 minutes from where I worked/these people lived and it was literally zero problem for me to do it minus navigating rush hour traffic and some tricky parking situations The holidays were always fun too clients would go all out to make extravagant Christmas cards with just their pet(s) on the front to give us with money/gift cards and we always got lots of treats,trippapotamus,16274610920,8

h6v186h,ot0pdk,Ive been in really expensive homes of clients and Ive realized one thing - the rich are not super smart Many are of average intelligence (based on my opinion) This levels the playing field of life tremendously People assume rich people are "better" than them or smarter Not true They just have one benefit - more money than most of the population A lot of money is passed down through inheritance or businesses I know one guy with a jewelry store Hes retiring so his son is taking over the business My friend says how much his son has worked for this - son is lower 20s and went to college as his "experience" Instead of struggling like many of us to create and build he gets an instant jewelry store of which he will make millions And Im sure he will come to believe he worked hard for all his money Some rich people are intelligent and created new and unique things for their wealth But thats not the majority The bottom line is that dont let anyone make you feel less than them especially over having more money than you,Athenarita,16274975280,9

h6v7l36,ot0pdk,When I first moved to LA in 2000-2001 I temped for a very rich older woman in Beverly Hills Essentially she was a "society lady"; she spent her time on charity committees and day-drinking (It took me a while to realize that wasnt iced tea in her glass in the mornings) I was in charge of generating and tracking invitations to events since she wasnt all that computer literate I only really did any work when she was watching me though and as soon as she left for lunches or meetings Id just goof off online (via dial-up lol; even though I was broke I had high-speed internet before she did) Her husband had made a lot of money as a producer and was mostly retired though he still kept an office -- I think mainly so he wouldnt have to be at home all day I heard her tell a friend on the phone once that she & her husband would probably kill each other if they had to be cooped up together all day which is hilarious given that their house was the size of a museum The entryway had one of those double-spiral-staircase thingies Every surface that \*could\* be marble \*was\* marble The basement had a screening room as big as one of the smaller theaters in the Drafthouse Outside there was a tennis court (which Im pretty sure was never used) a gazebo and who knows what else For her husbands birthday she wanted to surprise him with a new Jaguar; I had to call a bunch of dealerships to find out what they had in stock that day (They already owned two Bentleys so a Jag would have been kind of slumming it for them but whatever) Once I watched her husband pay their staff (a husband & wife who did their cooking & cleaning) by opening up literally a box full of money It felt like a scene from Goodfellas as directed by Nancy Meyers They were friends with a lot of other rich people who were more famous I was assigned to drop off a package at Aaron Spellings house Didnt get to go inside but even just being able to see past the iron gate was pretty stunning Virtually nothing about their lives and lifestyle was appealing They were doing all the performative rich-person things and as far as I could tell enjoying none of them When Christmas came they hired someone to come decorate their tree ("I cant imagine decorating my own tree" were her exact words) I probably worked there for about six months in total and the longer I stayed the more disgusted I became by the surroundings Im now fortunate enough to afford a decent house but I cant fathom ever wanting to live in an actual mansion,KinaLilletBottle,16275002220,5

h7a0shs,ot0pdk,I dont exactly cater to them but my great uncle and aunt are fucking loaded They have two IDENTICAL houses in different parts of Toronto which is already a stupidly expensive area to buy a closet in and not only did they buy the houses they were *custom built* When we told them we were looking for a house to rent at the beginning of Covid they were just like here take this house and let us live in the second house for free The house especially stood out because it had been built right next to a bunch of normal sized houses It was by no means a mansion they had a limited space after all but it was much taller then the others around is and wider too Inside all the furniture was white which made my mother super paranoid and she immediately covered them so we wouldnt ruin it The kitchen table had a glass top and the floors where made of very dark wood which always showed even the slightest amount of dirt on them and we were constantly sweeping It was also filled with the strangest decor A huge neon framed image of Marilyn Monroe in the same room as bleach white couches and glass tables with futuristic metal candle holders Metal table decorations that looked like maces and one like a dick There were so many windows too The dining room had windows all along two of the walls that went from floor to ceiling My room had three floor to ceiling windows as well with no curtains overlooking a street so the first thing we did was slap curtains on that I also had a square walk in closet so that was an interesting experience my clothes didnt even take up half the closet I ended up moving to a new school and when my classmates found out where I was living they all got super excited and kept asking what was inside They had all watched it while getting built and then watch it be empty for *two fucking years* before we came along One of my great uncles kids asked us how we were enjoying the "party house" while we lived there There was multiple sets of furniture stored away too When we arrived I was showed to an area filled with different bed cover sets and told I could pick whichever one I liked There was never a piece of furniture we couldnt find None of the rooms had lamps in them so after a small expedition we found enough lamps to light the whole house with just lamps There were so many miscellaneous items in that storage space to decorate with I will never forget the wall of just decorative pillows They also have a third house in Lebanon that has so many floors they need an elevator to go around the house It has multiple living rooms and multiple formal sitting rooms There are two kitchens on different floors and more balconies then I can count One of the dining rooms that was only ever used once in our entire stay with them at the Lebanon house had these pillars surrounding the table that were really thick with flat reflective glass on the table facing ends that where filled with china and glass sculptures They also had a spiraling staircase that was used to traverse the three main floors and get up to the attic It was this stone marble-y thing that was very slippery if you had socks on and there was absolutely no railing It was just a drop off I feared falling to my doom every time I used those stairs When we went to Lebanon we also got to meet some of our cousins (I didnt bother asking how in the world we are related at some point you just accept that maybe everyone in the middle east is your relative) They also had a multiple story house and happened to have three young children One was four one fourteen and one sixteen They had two nannies and the kids had these little remote things that could call the nannies for them like a bell but digital A lot of the nights the adults where out and the kids would all be left together with the nannies at the cousins house The fourteen year old had a wall that was just a bookcase and he admitted to me he hadnt read over 3/4 of them He had so many books I was dying to own and didnt even know the plot of them He had a play room that wasnt like just a play room it was *his* playroom and it had a huge tv that he played Fifa on All three boys went to private school obviously and were surprised my siblings and I attended public school The fourteen year old was planning on going to a football summer camp that cost more then our trip there The family hosted a dinner party once where they took us out to dinner and then had a second dinner at their home They had this huge tray of sushi except Im not sure they knew exactly what sushi was because it seems they knew the gist and guessed from there It was wrapped in seaweed but the inside was like no other sushi Ive had before It was disgusting but maybe its a rich person thing Most of it was thrown away Seeing all the excess in Lebanon made me really sad honestly All if it was so pointless Anyways that kinda got off topic but yeah it always amazes me how they live and how money is never a barrier for anything for them Oh yeah and they have Picasso paintings in the house they live in I cant believe I forgot that My brother commented on the nice painting they had hanging on the wall in the front hall and my great Aunt just casually goes oh yes its Picasso,Psychology-onion-300,16277906980,7

No one ever handed them a bill He never pulled out a wallet He didnt have to hand over his AMEX Black Card The assistant had two junior associates whose sole job was to handle these kinds of logistics Like one would stay behind and settle up any bills tips extras to-go orders leftovers etc And they would coordinate carefully so they never got so bogged down that anyone had to wait on them But that blew my mind When he comes into a restaurant hes led directly to his table where pre-arranged food and drink arrive within 30 seconds of him being settled at the table When he decides hes done (could be 5 minutes or two hours) he gets up and walks out with Executive Assistant in tow and Factor #1 (each of the two guys who handled money was called a Factor) would stay behind settle any bills and take any additional orders theyd had It was routine to grab food for the rest of the crew/entourage even if the security detail doesnt get a chance to eat for awhile I cant imagine going through life just never having to wait to pay off a bill settle up the check wait on a waiter to take my order etc There were way more excessive displays of wealth in the way of cars yachts houses and much more But their ability to almost literally buy time by outsourcing every time-consuming bit of daily minutiae broke my brain,ronearc,16274893180,2

Id love to see Italy some day" This kid no shit looks at me confused and says: " Vacation? I mean we were only there for five days butUmyeahI guess its like a vacation" The oldest daughter went to some expensive art school out of state for over $100000 graduated and moved back in to make $5 bead bracelets (Which Im not knocking I just think its weird to pay over $100k to learn how to make a bracelet and her parents LOVED to mention this all the time) Parents bought her a brand new Mercedes and she totaled it three days later into a few brick mailboxes while texting a driving then got a brand new BMW the next week paid in cash Basically all their money came from the husband who dabbled in the stock market and had several articles done on him regarding him as a stock market genius he pisses in the kitchen sink because he doesnt want to walk down the hall to the bathroom and has underwear that looks like he wipes it in mud When we told his wife who kept complaining about the sink smell that he was pissing in the sink she thought it was funny and said "yeah he dont like walking down the hall hes a character aint he!!?" 2) At another clients house Had built a good relationship with this couple who worked for BMI records Totally cool people and we had been cleaning for them for a few months They bought a new house and wanted us to clean it so we did a 8 hour deep clean in this new construction home Were headed out the door when the couple shows up with two moving trucks + movers and the husband wants us to stay longer to clean up what the movers track in They never told us this before an 8hr deep clean day in 95+ degree weather We say we cant and this dude flips his shit on the movers instead of us Tells them this is all their fault for not bringing "booties" or something to cover their feet He walks into the house screaming "LOOKS LIKE OUR NEW HOME IS GOING TO BE COVERED IN DIRT RIGHT AFTER WE PAID TO CLEAN IT!! THATS MY F***ING LIFE!! THAT IS MY LIFE!!" He started walking around inside so I couldnt hear fully from outside but when he was saying the word "booties" specifically his voice would crack and was pitched at all different levels like a mad man Almost like saying the word pissed him off but he just had to keep saying it to feed his anger lol Complained for about 30 mins about paying for movers who "arent smart enough" to know he paid someone to clean his house first? Their kids where like children of the corn The daughter ran to the bathroom my fianc was cleaning and just stood there before running and telling her mom she cant go to the BR because "that girl is in the way" She argues with her mom and says she dont want to talk to my fianc to get her to leave the BR Mom gets mad and demands the daughter go pee Daughter comes to the BR door and my fianc says "honey Ill leave so you can use the bathroom" Kid doesnt speak and just stands there pissing on herself in defiance It then made sense why all their clothes and the washer smelled straight up like pee 24/7 Then we noticed her school sends her home with freezer bags of piss underwear because she does it all the time Nothing wrong with her just spoiled and bratty 2) At another clients house cleaning before thanksgiving Their family was in town and while they spent they day out we cleaned up An electrician was there installing a dimmer switch and then left about 10mins after the family left Were upstairs almost finished up for the day when the family comes in We hear "GREAT!!" in a very angry sarcastic tone before we hear repeated smacks against the wall and the family gasping or saying "oh my god Peter!" (Husband) then the wife starts crying and were upstairs like wtf just happened Im nosey as fk so I go down there and Peter had seen the light switch wasnt finished so he smashed it into the wall and was now laying on the couch holding his head saying "all I wanted was a dimmer switch" while the wife was crying and saying "This is how we live" to his mother and father visiting broke my heart for her but we awkwardly wished a happy thanksgiving and left Later on found out that the electrician had to leave because his family lived in Gatlinburg while the fires were tearing through the mountains and he couldnt get a hold of them so he dropped everything and drove straight there Found this out when Peter told me "I called that POS electrician and he told me (starts to make a mocking imitation voice of the southern worker) my mommy and daddy is scared of them there fires and I hav ta go make sure they is smart enough to know that fire hot! Must escape fire!" Never went back to them after that comment 3) Cleaned for one of the biggest writers of the music in Disney channel movies/shows and hands down is the worst human Ive ever met for MANY reasons They owned five houses around downtown that they rented out for Airbnb and their personal home was one of them Were cleaning his house one day after guests leave and I find a bag of womens underwear sort of hidden underneath a closet gap that I only found by sticking the vacuum hose under it and it sucked up a part of the bag I honestly didnt think anything of it Figured I found his wifes diet laundry and left it in the hamper Few months later we are cleaning his studio in the back when I find the bag again on a pull out mattress opened and showing all different sizes and types used panties Red flag goes off that this dude is a panty sniffer but whatevs some people are into weird shit If he wants to sniff his wifes underwear than thats their deal ya know? Two weeks go by and we come to clean again and run into the guests who are busy looking for something before they leave The boyfriend is now waiting to leave while the gf is looking in all the drawers and the laundry roomI tell them whatever they left we will mail back to them and the bf laughs then says "Oh she cant find some of her underwear and a bathing suit so if you guys find it just throw it away" sort of just shrugging it off Then he asked if we came in while they were here and I said no we only clean before/after and he just goes "hmmm" Then it all made sense We had another guest ask us the same thing if we had come in while they were here The Disney writer was coming in while the guests were out downtown and taking the womens used underwear,StrangemanRDR2,16275008130,4

h6u2br7,ot0pdk,I dont know about "super rich" but Im sure they qualify with this towns economy First one was a guy who owns a company that does a lot of automation and logistics engineering for the local dairies guys said to be a multi-millionaire But what we were working on was the air conditioner/heat-pump for his home: an old run-down single-wide trailer house The only indication that he had money was the fact that he drove a brand-new Dodge Challenger which he summarily scuffed up on his rocky bumpy driveway Second one was a local pastor who said he wanted "the biggest house on the block" in an already ritzy neighborhood The shower in their master bathroom had almost the same square footage as the living room in my apartment by which I mean it was HUGE for a shower and a long long hallway The roof was also ridiculously steep which is good for snow which we dont get a lot of but we do get a lot of high winds so I imagine if their house is as slapped-together as every other house in this town that roof wont last long And at any rate the insane height/pitch made it impossible for us to replace the attic vent fans when they went out,MisterMagooB2224,16274830280,2

h6uk7mx,ot0pdk,Well I never catered to him but my dad worked with a guy for many years (like 20 years or so) near Las Vegas he built a sizable fortune over the years from pretty much nothing he managed money well but believed that any problem could be solved by throwing money at it until it agreed with him he was very much a go getter type of guy always wanted the next big thing wanted nice cars big house more and more money he was never satisfied with what he had and always worked to have more Over the years of knowing him he got immensely wealthy I think his net worth must have been somewhere near or above a billion dollars He had several mansions across the US a few in Europe his own private airstrip and jet private golf course and probably a lot more I never knew about For example one time when we went to stay with him on a work trip he bought a bulldozer and ran over one of his bmws because he was "getting a new one anyway and wanted to have some fun" he was definitely not a stable person and saw his wealth as an excuse to do whatever he wanted since he never really had to care about anything After he ran it over he just got out and left the dozer idling until it ran out of gas and it stayed in his yard wedged over a bmw for what must have been months eventually his wife got tired of him basically being a billionaire playboy and she left him and got custody of their kids because she showed in court that he was an absent father and his mental health was unstable His argument against losing custody was pretty much "look at all the money I have I can give them whatever life they want" Losing his kids probably messed him up bad Im just assuming since I didnt really know him the last time we went to visit him he was sleeping in a mattress on the floor of his living room and doing nothing but watching TV and eating McDonalds all day As far as I know thats still all he does After that visit my dad tapered off working with him since he didnt really do anything anymore and would become hostile if pressed to deliver anything work related,Bloorajah,16274905130,1

i2zbsav,tto3f2,I live in a Third World country and most of the time this is what were taught: - when going to a shady neighborhood DRESS DOWN (as much as possible dont bring a bag or if you do make sure the bag is something you can easily put in front of you) - do NOT put your money in just one item like your wallet(hide bills - fold or flatten them - in your phone case your socks hidden pants pocket etc - this will serve as your emergency money in case you lose your wallet) - wear dark sunglasses when taking a public transpo so youll be harder to read - if you are a tourist ask the locals around for the exact price (for fare for food for item) - some street sellers tend to scam tourists and make them pay a RIDICULOUS amount (I saw this happen but the tourist didnt buy the item cause his friend - a local - stopped him) - Edit: Some taxi drivers will deliberately take a longer route so they can get more from you Download apps that would serve as your gps Some taxi drivers have drugs they use to get you to inhale and knock you out (they do this by shaking some powder near the airconditioning of the car so you directly inhale it - its a subtle scent but it makes your throat dry) IF you smell it/suddenly feel drowsy ask to be dropped off IMMEDIATELY or open the window They would usually pretend to open candy or smth and the powder is usually in the candy wrapper EDIT: Its not a powder Its a spray scam They just shake or rub the candy wrapper to mask the sound when they spray it - bring your own water bottle when going to a club To be safer: order shots (shotglasses wont give them enough time to spike your drink) or beer so you can carry the bottle Constantly drink water so you can "flush out" the alcohol in your system giving you a good buzz but not shtfaced drunk EDIT: omg I didnt know about the whole water and not flushing out of your system lel forgive me for that - Ive been correcter in the comments Guess it just keeps you from getting dehydrated and gives you clean and safe drinking water  EDIT EDIT: I think by now you guys know what country Im talking about These are just a few of the "usual" things you need to be careful with Im not at all trying to malign my country Trust me there are a LOT of good things here too Come visit ,NooodleOwO,16488198130,2882

i348a9s,tto3f2,I late to this My best experience with really bad places is third world abroad 1) Youre not in Europe/US DO NOT take photos of cops or military Ever Do not take photos of areas with security You WILL draw the attention of people with guns and authority they might let you just show you deleted the photos but they also might take you or your phone or your cash or all three 2) Do not take photos of people without their permission They might get mad In many cultures thats offensive and they might feel exploited They also might insist you pay them And other locals will join in on that 3) Pointing is a bad idea in any hard place 4) In the third world you can be in the hardest place and things can still be peacefully and ok and safe But the difference in a hard place is how random or how fast things can go from 0(peaceful/safe) to 100 (shots fired/mob rule) 5) Eventually in some line some woman will "faint" so you have to catch her Thats a scam 6) Youll probably be in a car with the windows rolled down There will be traffic and times where things slow to a crawl ripe pickings for someone to run up grab your phone or backpack or bag and run 7) I promise you that you are not the street wise world traveler you think you are Act smart and like you know whats up Internally know you dont and be vigilant and careful 8) Understand how pickpocketing works Understand how grab and runs work They are not the same One is subtle The other is fast and aggressive Be vigilant about both 9) Dont leave bags behind in a car 10) Youll see a lot of hard things and poverty If you start giving out stuff like candy or money youll be amazed how mobbed you will get Maybe think twice and then five more times about giving handouts 11) kids are used as lookouts Kids are used as bait Kids are used to mob you Kids are trained as pickpockets 12) that local you dont know who invites you to pretty much anything should stay that local you dont know and have never done anything with 13) Do not assume a rule of law or property rights 14) ask the fare or cost before taking consuming or using anything 15) in many places the number one thing that makes you stick out is wearing shorts Grown men and women in Africa for example do not wear shorts 16) if you have to say where you are from say your state not the US US can go over really well or really bad But it is rarely neutral "Iowa" doesnt get much of a reaction 17) Your hotel room is not a safe haven You can be robbed in your room Your things are more likely to be stolen That little safe is not your friend 18) A safe place in the day is not necessarily a safe place at night 19) if youre in the bush and you get shot at it is life or death Get out of there Once they shoot they are committed 20) The NGO nonsense of "no guns" or "humanitarian aid" on the vehicles doesnt help Dont think means safe passage It does not 21) Do not assume UN soldiers are like cops They probably wont help you if something goes down 22) Be respectful in IDP camps That is people in their worst situation Youre not a tourist and they are not a show 23) your passport is life I wear mine on a holder than t hangs around my next and sits under my shirt 24) know where your nearest embassy is If not one for your country know the embassy of a "friendly" country that respects the rule of law 25) those armed guards are not like cops They arent getting paid to help YOU Dont get lulled into a false sense of security 26) a lot of local markets are selling a lot of "local" stuff that is made in mass somewhere else Be skeptical but have fun 27) store cash multiple places Shoe Money belt A little in the bottom of a backpack A little in pocket maybe A little in front button pocket Only show what you need to for a given transaction 28) if someone is crowding you or bumping you don;t worry about manners Be forceful Be loud Get distance And thst may require you to be hard with a girl or a kid 29) study before you go Know local manners Learn some basic phrases Know what to wear Know how to act 30) in some places cash is king BUT they might not take your cash if it is wadded or torn or too old Know this Have cash you can use And they will try to give you change in crummy cash that THEY took and cant use Refuse it Or you;l be stuck too,OrangeGringo,16489132860,5

h9ezslv,p6qb47,I have  quite a few actually But one that happened pretty recently stands out I grew up in a very rural area Mostly crop farms everywhere About a mile from my parents house there was this old abandoned farm house that all the area kids said was haunted They would sneak into the house after dark all the typical stupid kid crap but I believe there are things in this world better left alone and never went Years pass the house fell into disrepair and was eventually torn down leaving an old weathered barn Well I make a little side money selling photos of abandoned places so I wanted to take a picture of the barn I parked on the road and was walking up the drive I made it about ten feet before I just could not walk any further My feet wouldnt move forward my adrenaline spiked and I burst into tears So I turned back and ran to my car I didnt feel safe until I got past a nearby creek you have to cross to get there I let it go but a few months later we had to drive past the property after having Christmas dinner with my parents and there was a creature standing in the drive It reminded me of the Faun from Pans Labyrinth just super tall with a wide head and horns or antlers but the eyes were more on the side of the head Again adrenaline kicked in and I burst into tears but I was trying to keep it together because I didnt want to freak out my kids My husband asked if I was okay I just said "you saw that right" "Yep" "Was it human" "Nope" I refuse to drive that road ever again,FreakyDarling85,16292991070,2109

h9feg6c,p6qb47,This story happened and its the only supernatural event that happened in my life and it will die with me Going back to when I was about 9 my family was in the process of moving out to a new home however strange things started to happen at night almost as though there was a feeling that someone was watching me or following me These feeling began to give me weird dreams I never had before the ones where you feel as though you are stuck in there until something like falling off a cliff or death shocks you awake (a few months before moving out of the house) Since my room was at the end of the house and theirs on the other side of the corridor I began to sleep in their room with them because they never believed the stories and dreams I have told them So one night early around 4 I was sleeping with my arm hanging off the bed and i was in my dream standing alone on a side of the streets of what looks like New York waiting for a taxi for some reason I get into the cab and as soon as I got in the driver demanded money the moment I was about to hand over some cash to him I felt a hard and loud slap on my hand The shock zapped up my arm and woke me up instantly I looked around frantically to see who that was that just slapped me it was dead silent and no one was to be seen I tried to wake up my parents to ask them what happened but they were too deep asleep I pulled my hand back in and drifted back into sleep The next morning I woke up still remembering the feeling of what happened though this time I couldnt move I looked around and no ones in the room the doors closed and my body is paralysed I tried to calm and count down until I could and run for the door and get out of there You know previously that feeling of someone watching or being there I felt it again and this time as I made the move to run out the door it was pulling me back my body felt fuzzy and time never seemed so slow Of course I rushed out and cried to my parents but they brushed it off as I must be dreaming still Heres where it gets even more creepy we moved out of the house and on the first night of sleeping in our new house I tried to sleep and have the exact same dream as I ever so vividly remember it this time I was alone in my room it was about 2am and the exact same thing happened at the exact same time of the dream I froze my hearts beating out of my chest Im sweating and my eyes are closed I am sure that I never want to see this thing thats followed me,TheRevolutionaryArmy,16293056370,21

It took me by surprise at what an utterly bizarre thought id just had and why I decided to think that We get chatting and it comes to light that she is a mature student studying music andyou guessed it A bloody flautist Couldnt believe it Had another similar experience years later Backpacking around Australia and staying in a hostel Me and the guys I were travelling with had gotten a couple of weeks behind on our rent I dreamt the owner of the hostel walked into our dorm and said "the master wants his money guys!"

h9h1tm7,p6qb47,Ive had a couple All happened within the last couple years The first one occurred when I was in graduate school Our class was in a cohort meaning we took all classes together Translated to mean we spent the majority of our time together for two years One of my friends in the cohort was one of the most down to earth sweetest people you could ever hope to meet Her family had money Its only relevant because the last day of her life she went out on their family boat They being her father uncle and husband Had a great time Posted on social media about it They left the lake Returned the the uncles house She and her dad took one car The uncle and husband were in the other She and dad pulled up at the uncles house before the uncle The long lost brother who had A LOT of issues was sitting in the driveway Shot them both point blank Dad died immediately She held on for at least a week in critical condition Went to the hospitalthey allowed the cohort in to see her I couldnt handle it honestly Seeing this beautiful person who I compare to sunshine on a rainy daybloated with a gunshot wound to the headit was difficult to say the least Two days later she is still in a coma Im drinking that night I never really see her but I feel her presenceif that makes sense We had a brief conversation where she tells me goodbye Im not intoxicated to the point where Im hallucinating but it was vivid Like she was there We said goodbye She died the next day While I wasnt at the hospital with the rest of the cohort I felt at peace Could never tell them why As far as my grandfather that was something completely different He had terrible hospital care the last third of which was during a Texas natural disaster which couldve been avoided (A ROYAL FUCK YOU to Greg Abbott and UTMB) The first of which was due to overworked (but TERRIBLE) nurses rookie doctors trying to make uninformed decisions and a complete shit show of a hospital system The relevant part is he died at home on hospice with the family taking care of him Thats a story for another day (again FUCK you utmb) A couple days before he died I saw a shooting star in the afternoonvery weird for this area Once he diedhis cat who hadnt moved from his side except to eat and relieve himself started standing up and looking around the room Right after he was gone I walked into his porch and was looking at the apartment complex next door They have lights around their building that always turn on at 9pm on the dot That night they were off Right after he passed I walked to the outside porch Started crying softly and said "I hope youre in a happy place" Those damned lights which were off lit up like a Christmas tree Two days later Im standing on my porch thinking about my old man I think to myself "I hope hes somewhere happy" Right then a damn shooting star lights across the sky Mind you I live near SO many refineries in Houston its hard to see the most basic of stars Theres other small things that have happened but this is too long at this point If you made it this far thanks for reading More than happy to provide more details for the curious,IMayWantToThrowAway1,16293326750,10

h9hhrqh,p6qb47,About 10 years ago me and my then best friend decided to take a trip to Boston We were tight on cash so we were spending our money very wisely We had a nice day and ended it at bertuccis for lunch and walked back to the T with our leftover pizza in tow When we got to the station to buy our train ticket back we realized we accidentally spent too much money and needed like $4 to get ourselves back home Were both standing there like well wtf are we gonna do now? Our moms were gonna be furious if one of them had to pick us up I remember standing there holding the giant pizza box while my friend dug through her bag for extra change when suddenly someone reached over my shoulder and dropped EXACTLY the amount we needed in quarters on to my pizza box We both turned around immediately but there was no one close enough that could have done it or that was close enough to hear our conversion to know how much we needed Not as wild as everyone elses stories but it was a very bizarre experience that I still think about a lot,c0rgiqueen,16293402520,7
h9hl8yy,p6qb47,A little over 6 years ago I lost my mom to breast cancer The as heartbreaking as it was to lose her getting that time with her before she passed to share our goodbye and love for each other was priceless In the days before she passed she told my sister that we should look for her in rainbows Every time after that that I see a rainbow it makes my heart happy Well fast forward a few years I start dating a woman with a 10 year old son and love the heck out of both of them While we were dating she unfortunately went into kidney failure Knowing exactly what it takes to care for someone while they are truly very sick and knowing myself and that I had A LOT of work left to do on myself and I wouldnt be able to give her what she needed it broke my heart but I ended it because she has a long road ahead of her and needed everyone on her "team" all in But I never gave up on her and her son and the importance of him having his mom with him So I started working on myself for a much better reason than just getting myself to a better place but a much healthier place so I could sign up to see if I was a match to be a kidney donor for her Ill never forgot I was driving and was on the phone with my sister I told her that I put my name on the donor list the biggest of reasons was for her and her son to make sure they could have more time together As soon as I said that I turned a corner and a giant rainbow stretched across the whole horizon Couldnt really belive one that vivid and big popped up like that albiet it had been raining but I know mom was happy She sent me two more After a few potential donors feel through I got cakes to get tested I had just pulled into my church parking lot to light a candle and pray after all of the tests had been started but not knowing if I was a match yet Turns out eharmoney matched us first but the call I got in the parking lot that afternoon matched us forever While lighting the candle after the stained glass cast a shadow over the candle I know she was proud of me in that moment The other was as I was recovering the evening of donation When the nurse came in to take my vitals she had to turn on the BP machine and the whole damn startup screen was one giant rainbow! I just started laughing (pain meds helped bring out the humor of the situation also it still hurt like hell to laugh lol) I couldnt belive it I never really went "looking" for the rainbows and honestly didnt really see many before those times and I cant really explain it but mom really let it be known to me how she felt about my donation I pay a little more attention now Pair all that along with I ended up being a perfect kidney match to the girl I had been dating I fall back on that the supernatural can be the only explanation,ShepherdOverwatch,16293419870,8
h9i09pr,p6qb47,It was about a week after my mom died in 2014 I lived with her to help take care of her in her last year of life I went to bed in the apartment we shared When I woke up the next morning she was right there I said "mom you died" she said "no I didnt Im right here dont say stupid shit like that" Then I saw my little sister and told her about this horrible dream I had that mom died The 3 of us spent one last day together playing Skip-Bo & Uno and we got moms favorite Mexican place We then went shopping at Michaels mom was a big crafter I was emotional throughout the whole day saying things like "OMG Mom I thought you had really died it was awful" When we were getting ready for bed I told mom I didnt want to go to bed because what if this was a dream she laughed it off and reassured me she would be there in the morning We hugged goodnight I laid my head down and woke up from the most real dream of my life I remember it like a real memory Sometimes you can remember bits and pieces of a dream but i remember the whole day like it really happened We didnt have a lot of money when mom died so we didnt get a funeral or anything she was cremated I just moved mom and sister out here so I could take care of them the year before So they didnt know anyone in the area really Mom came back to visit me one last time to give me some closure during a very difficult time,Joshuah_Airbender,16293509600,7
h9firj6,p6qb47,Quite a few * The first I remember was the shadow man at the top of the stairs at my Grandmas (Moms Mom) House when I was 4 I saw him plain as day except the moonlight was shining through him He put a too long finger to his lips and shushed me when all I wanted was to climb in my parents bed I woke up the whole house when I decided to scream instead * Though my Pop (Dads Dad) had an encounter when I was about a year old He was watching me for the night He gifted me a doll that had been made of my Grandma (his late wife)s hair when she was a child I was too young to play with it but it was carefully preserved and sat in the china cabinet until my parents found a better place for it at our home He had fallen asleep with the TV on nothing out of the ordinary there while I was asleep in my Pack n Play in his living room He said he didnt know what woke him up but the first thing he remembers is hearing the giggle of a child which made his blood run cold before he remembered I existed Still I was supposed to be asleep so he got up to see what the fuss was about He came into the living room and flipped on the light I was sitting up holding my blanket and staring directly at the doll across the room having a full blown conversation in baby babble I of course remember none of this but hes confident I was talking to a woman Id never met * When I was about 2-3 we were over at my Grandmas House as I spent many a summer growing up All of the adults were on the front porch chatting and us kids were supposed to be playing in the back Suddenly I started screaming and came toddling up around the house crying my eyes out my oldest cousins in hot pursuit I kept babbling on about the baby in the tree and was quickly whisked upstairs for a nap According to my cousins I became fascinated with this ancient magnolia thats probably about as old as the house is (1776) Us kids were forbidden from playing around it because it was infested with poison ivy All of a sudden I became extremely concerned about a baby only I could see and/or hear and kept trying to go under the tree I became upset when they did their best to stop me Some adult eventually went and pulled on some waders and garden gloves and went under the tree and searched painstakingly for something anything to explain my frenzy Perhaps someone had thrown a toy or maybe a baby bird had fallen but nothing was found At the time Fast forward almost 20 years and the tree has to come down Its a crying shame but a local tree rot nearly took out the whole backyard and with hurricane season coming the ancient magnolia had to come down The tree company found a baby headstone It had a little lamb or angel or something I dont remember now It looked a lot like the other infant headstones that could be viewed at the churchyard a few blocks over We had a family plot that had a couple similar headstones It was broken but my Aunt recognized the topper almost instantly Shes volunteered at that church for almost 30 years and spent a fair time minding the baby graveyard Now someone could have stolen a headstone many many many years ago and dropped it in our backyard It was a straight walk from the cemetery it could have been happenstance that went unnoticed but we have a different theory Someone had a baby that wasnt an official member of the family a bastard if you will Another cousin has this idea that it was the lovechild between a servant and a member of the household way way back when Headstones like that cost money but this baby isnt registered in the Family Bible (Because every child that died young is marked either at the boneyard or elsewhere) The child obliviously died very young and was beloved enough to warrant an expensive marker under a tree in the back garden No body was recovered in the stump removal but it was probably long since gone I have no idea where the headstone ended up but Im getting desperate because we just sold out of the family and I need to collect what I can because I have a bad feeling the house is either going to be left to rot or made unrecognizable and inaccessible by some out of state yokels It cant be demolished thank God for historical preservation but Im about to lose everything,Professional_March54,16293075400,6
h9hm9nq,p6qb47,I was visited by my cat as she died This happened over 30+ years ago when I was in middle school We lived out on 7 acres of pecan orchard surrounded by farm fields in a very rural area outside of a small town in coastal Alabama The house sat right in the middle of the property and had a screened in porch on the back We had a couple of horses several dogs two cats and some hamsters The cats were mostly indoors but they went out occasionally and sometimes didnt come back in till the next day Mine was a little Russian Blue named Misty and I loved her dearly I had saved up my allowance and birthday money and found a reputable breeder She was such a tiny little kitten but I raised her into a fierce blue lioness who had a wonderful sense of humor and limitless patience with the awkward little girl who called her friend and sister We had a special bond She did everything with me slept on my pillow at night helped me with homework brought me lizard gifts When she was at the house we were inseparable My parents were pretty lax with many things so it wasnt uncommon for me to be up late at night watching TV downstairs This particular night I was curled up in an armchair with a blanket watching some movie or another The chair was angled towards the TV but I had full view of the full glass back door screen porch and yard beyond I remember feeling the hair on the back of my neck stand up a bit I cant really describe it It was like something was with me in the room and it drew my attention to the back door Sitting there on the other side of the glass watching me was Misty In that moment it didnt strike me as odd that she should be there waiting to be let in despite there being no way for her to enter the porch from outside She pawed at the door a bit and meowed a silent meow and I felt a sad peace come over me As I started to stand from the chair the peaceful feeling shattered and the cats body twisted and distorted tearing apart not in a gruesome way but more like smoke in the wind and her mouth opened wide in a scream I could not hear and then just like that she was gone The porch was empty nothing stood at the door I stared unsure of what had just happened Then I crept forward and opened it looking out all around the porch No cat to be seen I walked out into the dark and called her name nothing I went to the screen door It was locked I opened it and looked around the yard called her name a bit more but there was nothing out there except cool night air and the moon I figured I must have just imagined it it was some weird trick of the light a reflection on the glass Id had enough weirdness for one night though so I crept upstairs to bed We found her next morning as we were leaving for school There wasnt any blood and not much damage done other than a cut on one foreleg She looked like she had started towards the house but then just lay down and went to sleep before she could get there A car had hit her sometime in the night and I think when her body couldnt make it her spirit continued the journey One last visit one last goodbye to her favorite little girl,BellaBPearl,16293425110,5

h9mrg51,p6qb47,Back in the late 90s was a bad time for me I was out of work and was not in my best mind My adopted daughter had to be put in a hospital and I sat there day and night for three weeks hoping she would pull through Her femoral artery had burst and she almost bled to death It happened due to a minor surgery that had gone really really bad I didnt have any family support I was really alone in this discouraging world and I used to take breaks from the hospital and go sit in my car and cry I had hit bottom emotionally physically and money wise with no hope The only thing I enjoyed during the day was going to starbucks LOL and one day during this period in my life I went to Starbucks I was standing at the cream and sugar counter fixing my coffee with my back to everyone (Before the pandemic they had those cream and sugar counters) I sensed someone came up behind me and I immediately felt I needed to move alongand the person assured me there was no hurry They asked me why I was in the coffee shop this time of day Then my skin broke out in these prickly goosebumps and I was afraid to turn and look at the person next to me They had a kindness in their voice and an immediacy I had never experienced before Yet I wanted to get away from this being/person as quick as I could Because I was feeling intense love and acceptance like I had never known I was afraid I moved over to a table quite a ways away trying to keep my emotions in check so I would not burst out crying The encounter at the cream and sugar counter had made some kind of effect on me Logically I knew practically speaking that "nothing" out of the ordinary had taken place A minute or so passed and I ventured to look in the direction of the person on the other side of the room that I had encountered I had not seen who they were yet They were already looking at me with the most tender loving vulnerable eyes Eyes that say I know you better than you know yourself I burst into tears and ran out the door of Starbucks telling myself how crazy I was to be sobbing over a simple encounter How pathetic is that? But I knew I had just had an encounter with someone not of this world who was there specifically to help me How strange when little things mean so much A simple encounter magnified into a forever moment I thought it must have been an angel or Jesus Life continued to be very difficult after that day but after that encounter something in me rearranged so that I could carry on Shell Mel,Tricky-Ad-9058,16294405120,12
h9gq5eu,p6qb47,Not sure if this counts as supernatural but here it goes The summer after I graduated high school I got a job delivering pizza to help save money for college I had a lot of run-ins with some pretty weird characters but nothing like what happened this one night It was a Friday night We deliver pizzas until 3 am Fridays and Saturdays It was 2:45 am and we were preparing to close when our manager said we got a call for a delivery at place almost 20mins away Being the desperate for money teenager I was I offered to do the delivery This was before smartphones had GPS so I used a Garmin I plugged in the address and off I went The Garmin took me deep into the backwoods of rural Texas I finally arrive at my destination The house looked like something in a horror movie Big wooden two-story house with no lights on The first thing I notice about the house was that the front door was wide open I sat in my car for a few minutes debating on turning back and claiming no one was home Something just didnt feel right I needed the tip money so I sucked it up and approached the house When I got to the open front door I didnt enter Instead I knocked No one answered I knocked again as loud as I could No response I finally got the courage to say something "pizza delivery! Anyone home?" There was a few seconds of silence until I heard a weird voice "upstairs!" I walked into the house and could barely make out my surroundings because it was so dark I make it to the bottom of the stairs and look up into the dark abyss Again I said "pizza delivery" The voice spoke again "come up stairs I cant get out of bed" Something was very off about this voice It didnt sound normal The best I can describe it is if a dog somehow learned to talk but still had trouble pronouncing human words The hairs stood up on my neck There was no fucking way I was going up there The tip wasnt worth it I placed the pizza at the bottom of the stairs and shouted "Im leaving it here at the bottom of the stairs Have a good night" As I turned away the voice said "No! Come upstairs! I cant get out of bed!" I replied " Im sorry Im not even allowed to enter someones home on the job Youll have to come to get it" I heard some loud banging from upstairs with the voice shouting at full volume "COME UPSTAIRS! I CANT COME OUT OF BED!" The voice shouted this over and over again like it was a recording on a loop The banging got louder and louder as the voice got louder Then I heard something that weighed at least 300 lbs BOLTING down the stairs I noped the fuck out of there at full speed As I drove off I could see the silhouette of something in the doorway To this day I have no idea what the fuck happened in that house or what I saw,AskMeAboutMyTie,16293271440,3
h9itpnj,p6qb47,Several experiences happened to me I often dream about strangely specific things like getting a cut on my knee eating a specific thing or going somewhere with a friend One of them was when i was a kid i still remember the dream like i had it last night My dad vanished and my mom went crazy My sister became like a god to my mother and i was pushed aside Years later this happened My mom had kicked my dad out of the house because she thought he was cheating on her while in reality he was just working overtime to make enough money for the 4 of us by himself My mom started praising my sister with every step she took buying her everything she wished for with my dads money While i was ignored and didnt get any of that Instead of getting art supplies and sketchbooks like my sister did i was getting screamed at daily and i forgot you were here so i didnt make dinner for you Fortunately this dream had a happy ending I ran away from home and moved in with my father after finally getting to know him as my best friend Were happy and have taken my dads house back from my mother We dont know where she is now but were both relieved that we dont have to deal with her anymore,Witty_Journalist1574,16293743080,4

h9gix1s,p6qb47,I remember one time when I went into primary school feeling very sick over the thought that my granddad had died There was another incident going on where an envelope with some money had been stolen (it turns out the receptionist had actually lost it in the end) and naturally the teachers suspected the child who was pale and sweating when they brought it up They ended up questioning me for a long time probably ten minutes but it felt like hours which is why I remember it so Well When I came home my mum told me and my brother that one of our granddads had died I find it more likely that I had overheard my mum getting a phone call in the morning than me having a premonition but I dont remember anything of the sort Or this could all just be the warping of my memories,Pneumaniac01,16293238030,2
h9gj35d,p6qb47,The following happened in early 2000s My family was traveling around India for about a month - due to the extended time we had a good amount wheel luggage One of our destination was a small rural beach town Our bus arrived at the town sometime around 1-2am As we were walking down the misty and dimly lit streets my father struggled to pull his wheel luggage At some point we decided to turn the luggage over and check if there was damage on the wheels As we turned on our flashlights to take a better look we noticed a single strand of hair in the wheel Taking caution we pulled the strand Out came more than a handful of long hair rolling out of the wheels We felt a sense of dread that early morning However as we dropped off our belongings at a small hotel our fears faded as the owner and his little new born puppies welcomed us with warm smiles Little did we know what was about to happen in this seemingly peaceful town The one week we stayed there most of the puppies in that hotel died my parents were taken by a tide while swimming in the sea and both of them nearly drowned to death - saved by two extremely good swimmers To top it off after we left the town and arrived at our new destination we realized that all the money we had been carrying for the trip had been stolen We barely had enough to cancel the trip and buy tickets back to our home town The strands of hair was a terrible sign and we should have stayed away from that town,bethesdeun,16293238830,2

h9i5mdt,p6qb47,This thread has some crazy but awesome stuff Makes my experience feel a bit underwhelming in comparison but Ive enjoyed others stories and I havent shared this with anyone for sometime now so I figure Id contribute About 10 years ago I was in Argentina with a friend walking down the street Walking along a partially crowded sidewalk I saw a girl walking toward us that was *captivating* I dont mean that as an as interchangeable word with beautiful; she was pretty but not the type where you would give it a much of a second thought on a busy street She was dressed for field hockey including a stick Overall she was interesting but it her eyes seemed to be epicenter of the draw Nothing that I recall being particularly noteworthy except for the sensation of being captivated and fascinated Both my buddy and I looked to at each other after passing her and with few words realized we had had a similar snap moment experience Within a minute or so we were worrying about catching the bus that had just passed us and we ran and barely got on We handed the driver the money and moved towards the back of bus to stand and hold the the overhead rails I remember being partially zoned out mindlessly reflecting on various things with a good portion of the thoughts trying to figure out what had happened with the hockey stick girl 5-10 minutes passed by as the bus worked its way through town moving to the city limits I see the shuffle of feet as new passengers took their places There amidst all the feet I did a double take I saw a field hockey stick Now field hockey is popular in Argentina and more so with women; but not extremely common to where you see loads of girls running around with equipment all over Nevertheless I look up and you guessed it it was the very same hockey stick girl I was completely dumbfounded Whats more she was equally as captivating as she was before I know I tried not to stare but I couldnt help it It both felt like a very short and a very long time until she got off the bus I dont know how to explain how she got on the bus that far after us and why she was so intriguing And more the combination of the two things that leave me scratching my head; why was hockey stick girl so fascinating in the first place followed by her using magical teleportation abilities in order to use public transportation,fightforfiving,16293549710,2
h9i9g68,p6qb47,I have a few incidents My uncle (moms brother) committed suicide Their dad had passed away a few months earlier and he was just lost after that After the funeral everyone gathered at our house We were all talking sharing memories and such Talk turned to the afterlife After my grandpa had died my uncle had dreamed about him and in the dream had asked him what heaven was like Grandpa told him "its like reaching into your pocket for your money but you cant reach it" We took that as being able to see all of us living but not getting to talk to us or hug us And we talked about the time my mom and sister were pulling into the driveway at our house and saw through the front window what they thought was my uncle drinking a cup of coffee It was just days after grandpa had passed and my uncle and his family had been at our house a lot so they just assumed it was him though no cars were there They come inside and absolutely no one was in the house But the coffee in the pot was still sloshing like someone just poured some They were freaked out enough that they went and got our neighbors to come check out every inch of our house for someone So after all this supernatural talk someone said that if anyone would contact us from beyond my uncle that had just died would Immediately there were three very loud knocks on the wall It was an interior wall and no one was in the that area of the house whatsoever My grandma had always reminded us of a ladybug and since shes passed we encounter ladybugs in some really unusual ways and places A couple of years ago I had almost died of sepsis and pneumonia (which ironically wound up saving my life because the cat scan uncovered a massive cancer tumor on my spleen that I had zero clue was there) and I had fluid built up around my left lung While they had my gurney parked in the hallway waiting to go in to get a tube out in to drain the fluid I was laying there honestly feeling really bored waiting just staring at the ceiling and suddenly I felt a hand wrap around my foot over the blanket and give it a reassuring squeeze I looked expecting to see the doctor but absolutely no one was there and the two orderlies that were waiting with me both suddenly commented on how crazy cold it suddenly got When my other uncle passed away in our house moments after the last emergency responder left and we were in that weird what next calm suddenly we heard a beeping It was brief but very loud and very distinct It sounded like a digital watch alarm None of us have ever had a digital watch nor had any sort of electronic device that made a sound even remotely like that And since that uncle passed we find dimes all the time in unusual places and situations One time when I was vacuuming I saw a glint of something shiny falling out of the corner of my eye Discovered a tiny golden cross charm laying on the carpet I literally just vacuumed No one recognized this cross Worked in a toy store that was haunted I was having to work an overnight shift with a small crew that kept getting smaller because people got creeped out and quit One night it was just me and one other girl Lunchtime rolls around and were eating in the break room and a penny falls onto the table between us Then another Then another I look up expecting to see pennies wedged into the ceiling tiles from a prank or something but theres none nor any sign there had been Then another penny hits the table It starts raining pennies so we high tail it out of there After a few minutes we go back in and theres pennies everywhere All over the tables the floor Just everywhere I picked them all up and had $247 The other girl I was with quit on the spot That place had a lot of spooky stuff but that was the craziest The place I work at now has a ghost cat I was sitting just watching tv a few months before I had my surgery to remove my spleen and clear as day in my head I heard a voice that wasnt mine say "Im sorry but youre going to die" I was crying because you hear about people who just seem to know theyre going to die before they die and with the cancer and the surgery I thought oh crap I guess this is how they know But its been a year a half and Im still here So I guess the voice was wrong or it takes longer than I expected One night I had just got in bed and looked out into the hallway and saw an old man appear It was so bizarre He was a small guy reminded me of Ghandi except white He was in a hospital gown and had a walker He looked around and looked confused like "where the hell am I?!?" and proofed Weve lived in this house for close to 30 years and I have no clue who that man was I often wondered if perhaps if he belonged to a family that lived there before us and popped in there by mistake When I was young I would wake up in the middle of the night hearing someone making a sandwich This was back in the day when mayonnaise jars were glass and had metal lids We had a wooden cutting board that pulled out the counter and you could hear the sounds of the mayo lid on that wood cutting board and the sound of a knife being set down on the counter I would go see who was making a snack hoping maybe I could get one too and no one in the kitchen And zero evidence of midnight sandwiches Several years later I found out that my great grandma that had lived there before I was born was very fond of making late night sandwiches so apparently I was hearing her residual activity I had dated a man that I had known as a friend most of my life and therefore had tons of mutual friends After we broke up we still had the same social circle He married someone else and had a kid One time his son said to his mom in front of me and his dad and everyone else "I wasnt supposed to be yours" He pointed to me and said "I was supposed to belong to her But its okay because I love you still" He didnt know his dad and I used to date Most awkward,Low-Stick6746,16293581030,2

hbfty7t,p6qb47,You may not care about my story or think its lame but I still get chills every time I tell it Here it goes: For some background It is maybe the summer of 2016 or 2017 I was in the ranch/ town that my grandmother and her siblings grew up in in Dr Arroyo Nuevo Len Mexico(Mexico is literally where evil/supernatural shit happens 24/7) We were there to do a vacation bible school for the kids there The people there are very poor and my grandmother basically does Gods work there and spreads the word to them (This wont get super religious I promise) Anyways the day started off fine It was super hot in the morning and cold at night (The ranch/town is in the mountains of mexico) So night time comes around and like I said it was summertime so I didnt have a sleep schedule other than waking up and sleeping when I wanted to The way our house is laid out there is like the letter L Theres a kitchen patio then rooms Me 2 of my cousins and 2 other guys from church were sitting in the patio under the lights just talking A few years before my uncle (said cousins dad) was possessed when my grandparents were coming back from their annual trip for the bible school Mind you this is a 10+ hour drive from the order of mexico So an 15 hour trip total back home They stopped in MonterreyNLMexico at my uncles house for the night Well I wasnt there to witness it but my grandparents and cousins were (Sorry I suck at telling stories a lot of stuff comes to meat different times in the story) My cousins have always told me that they have seen very scary/evil shit like babies with red eyes and sharp teeth or shadows/knocks etc Back to the possessed thing my grandma told us she woke up for no reason around 3AM I know the irony of the devils hour She heard screaming coming for my uncles room so she dashed over there Im assuming when she ran is when my grandpa woke up and out of instinct followed behind her She walked in the room to find him in there with my aunt with all of the lights on He was on the bed saying his head hurt really bad my grandmother being very religious called my aunt in (her sister) to come pray for him for the headache to pass What a big mistake that was! As soon as the grabbed the bible and went to go hold their hands on him to pray he pushed them away and shit hit the fan He apologized and said it wasnt him Immediately after a deep scary sounding voice said in spanish "Dont touch him" At this point my grandparents uncles and aunts are in the room along with my cousin telling the story and theyre shitting bricks I think they said the floor did kind of a wave and made them fall or move back Thats where I think the story ended they prayed over him and idk what happened but i think it worked Thats the end of how he was possessed Back to the night on the ranch so my cousin told us the story you just read along with more thing that have happened in their house Well story time ended and we decided to go make pancakes in the kitchen after pancakes we were still on edge to say the least A black cat passed us and that was kind of the first red flag We decided to finally go hit the hay the house that we were sleeping at was a few blocks up and to the left from our house The 3 of us ( me and the 2 guys from church) decides the most efficient route was up 3 streets and left and up another street to get to where we were sleeping Spoiler alert: IT WASNT! About 2 blocks up we heard drunk guys yelling at us telling us to "come here" but using very vulgar words Were from texas and everyone in Mexico is under the impression that every American is rich so we decided not to because we were afraid wed be robbed or hurt Well like I said the town is very poor and well street lights arent exactly the thing they spend most of their money on so there wasnt too many The street we had planned to go through had one but it also bad a band of drunks So it was either go down a dark street where there is zero light whatsoever or go back down to the house and try to go left then up We went back to the house Everyone else was sound asleep and the didnt answer the door (I think we stopped to pee) So right before we get to this intersection we see a huge black bull Now bulls are no small animal but this one was abnormally HUGE like maybe double the size of what youd call a big bull in length height and width We stopped in our tracks and had a big WTF moment We heard stories of bulls getting out and attacking people but this was no small bull so we didnt know what to do The bull was perfectly placed under the street light (remember this for later) still as a statue We moved back and to the right and were pressed up against someones wall and basically talked with our eyes and decided to wait it out and let it pass The bull is facing west and were facing north all of a sudden the bull looks at us with these big bright red eyes and walked away in the direction that we were going to walk after waking down the street we were on So at this point our 2 options were to walk behind a demon bull or get the shit kicked out of us by drunks Well it had occurred to me that the one of the guys with us had the keys to the van we rented to get over here I suggested that we turn around go back to the joys and jump the fence and sleep in the van after all it was a van with 3 rows not including the driver and passenger seat and there were 3 of us so thats what we decided to do We turned back and headed for our house which was about 500 feet away after maybe 200 feet I looked back either out of curiosity or peace of mind to see that nothing else was coming after us/ happening Well would you guess what I saw the damn bull again This time it made one of those sounds you hear in a movie or at the rodeo its kinda like a scream that bulls make when theyre pissed or about to charge at you Yes that noise you just played in your head Thats exactly what we heard and then it just walked away west as it was originally facing Well we all had fully turned around and were facing north again and decided it was best to just go to the van because we were so close Well where the fence/ mini wall to our house started there was a neighboring house that belongs to my aunt who happens to be my grandmas sister(remember this for later as well) stuck out more then our fence/ wall and was obviously a lot taller since it was a house There was about a foot and a half area where the house stuck out more than the wall I shit you not idk if it was someone or something but it peered out looked at us and went back into the shadows We fucking booked it to the other side of the house jumped the fence and went straight into the van We sat in silence while we caught our breath and had a quick chat to verify that everything just happened and we got comfy for bed Needless to say I didnt sleep till about 3 but I heard owls dogs and cats fighting and various rustling throughout the night I am convinced the devil was doing anything and everything to lure us out of that van that night The next morning at breakfast we told everyone our story and the just laughed Okay now fast forward to 2019 I had just stopped talking to my father figure about a month before the incident^ We had started talking again in around 2019he told me that he had a dream that i was stuck somewhere or needed help and it involved a bull under a street light When I tell you my jaw DROPPED! Anyways thats the end of it! If you have questions or need clarification please let me know!,Calebg03,16306726580,2
ha0zh82,p6qb47,this question is flawed All events can be explained The absence of an explanation doesnt make something "supernatural" I saw what I thought was the ghost of an old man when I was 18 He had died in the house and I saw a bluish shape in the window of the room he died in complete with facial features what did I see? I dont know But I *do* know that I didnt see a ghost At the time I was heavily involved in "ghost" hunting (long before the show) and believed in everything I read No critical thinking no seeking out a rational explanation I believed the dead were walking among us As a result I saw and heard things that I thought were ghosts Urban exploration is rife with odd sounds and in a heightened state a creak is a ghost Wind in a tunnel is a ghost A change in air temperature is a ghost So ultimately that day my brain saw what it wanted to see A light reflection on the glass took the shape of an old man because I knew the old man had died in that room Im more fascinated at our brains ability to distort perception as it attempts to make sense of the world around it We are skittish creatures looking for enemies at every corner and combine that with a lack of education face pareidolia and an actual desire to see ghosts and voila you see ghosts The leap from "I cant explain what happened" to "it was the dead returning from the grave" or "a force beyond the physical world" is so astronomical it would require extraordinary evidence *Never once* has a supernatural claim stood up to the scientific method EVP cold spots electromagnetic disturbances telepathic communication its all total bullshit Anyone who says it seriously (like the tv shows) is either getting paid a lot of money to do it or is regurgitating the nonsense they read online *Ghost hunting isnt real* Simply claims of the supernatural should be easily dismissed Our real world is far more fascinating,LewisEFurr,16297233730,-1

I told her I was having lunch with my grandparents and she asked me to send a picture I had done nothing to deserve this suspicion or distrust but I sent her the photo and once lunch was done I told her it was over,Big-Money-Sloth,16218590020,37

gz9il13,njrvgm,This was back in January She was a tenant at my house and we stayed decent friends But this was above and beyond anything I had experienced with her Lets call her Britt She read some Tarot cards that said this was the season of moving She informed me of this and I said "Okay so are you going to move?" She said "Im not sure I definitely want to move before Mercury goes into retrograde and I want to do it soon" So she gives notice to move out in April fine Then she gives notice for March Then she asks if she can leave next week? You know what fine whatever Sure move next week Ill help you GTFO Then she changes her mind and wants to move in April then March I told her to MAKE UP HER MIND She finally decides she wants to leave in two weeks Okay fine let me help you move out She then decides that "moving" means "vacation" and that she wants to go to Hawaii to relax on the beach I tried to tell her that there were plenty of beaches where we lived (west coast USA) and she could relax there NOPE She wants to be on a beach in Hawaii Now a few things to keep in mind - she is a broke single mom that is completely irresponsible with her money Shell blow money on a whim and never has anything saved Its a poverty mindset "Why save when theres always an emergency? Ill just deal with it when it happens" Now theres nothing wrong with broke single women I get it Being a single parent is hard But its that she decides to dump her kid off with her ex take the stimmy check and use that money to book a plane ticket to Hawaii and say "yo Ill be back in six months Landlord can you hold my place for me at the house? I dont want to pay rent during this time but can you hold it until I get back?" I told her no She gave notice I already posted an ad Shes leaving In other conversations I had with her she expresses that "she misses the freedom of not being a parent" and "wishes she could take back being a mom" She then informed her child that she would be gone for "up to 6 months but wasnt sure when she would be back" Her child was understandably devastated but took the news best he could During the last few days at the house I went over to do some normal maintenance housework While there her son was in my way "MOVE God youre always in the way!" she shouted at him "Sorry" her child said sheepishly He moved and I continued about my work but he was in my way again as I continued to work "HEY YO YOU GOTTA GET OUT OF HIS WAY God youre SO SLOW at everything! Jesus would you move?" He didnt reply and sulked off to his bedroom I was thinking "If shes like this when Im around what is she like when Im not around?!" After moving out completely her son went off to his fathers place while she booked it for Hawaii When she reached Hawaii she texted me that "she was sorry for being so hasty in coming out but hoped we could remain friends" I told her to fuck off and never contact me again I assumed things were over NOPE Within two weeks I got a request from two different landlords asking me for a rental reference for her! Like is she INSANE?! So she told everyone she was going to Hawaii for six months then stayed there for two weeks and came back What the actual FUCK I told the two landlords that I refused to give a rental reference and that I would not rent to her again She requested a third rental reference from me from yet another landlord When that landlord asked me for a reference I told him "Could you kindly tell her to fuck off? She wont listen to me but maybe shell listen to a stranger" I never heard from her again,mechpaul,16218578340,157

gz9xljo,njrvgm,Honestly I held on for a while Mostly out of fear of what she would do to me she threatened to take my livelihood and my son This was a woman I was married to for ten years At first we were very much in love Then I joined the army so I could afford to give us a better life I went away for training for a year came back to a completely different person She cheated on me constantly told me she wouldnt have sex with me because I was gay Im not gay but she decided that was her narrative and held onto it She would tell me I was useless stupid and worthless And then for a little while she calmed down Started being nice and even having sex with me again Made it all seem like a mental health crisis Turns out she had fucked a few guys without condoms and wanted to keep her security blanket in case she got pregnant again And she did indeed become pregnant I was excited I always wanted 2 or 3 kids so the idea of a second child excited the hell out of me and made me temporarily forget all the bad stuff Then she miscarried And it was a bad one Blood all over the bathroom and puke on the walls and then I had to sit with her for 10 hours because the doctors lost the ultrasound and couldnt confirm the miscarriage I have never felt so helpless and it fucked me up for about four years In that time she started hitting me telling me all her pain was my fault and bullied me into a very one sided open marriage where she could fuck whoever she wanted but went into a jealous rage anytime I found someone interesting So finally its Xmas 2014 Im damn near suicide at this point Seriously considering my options and how I would do it while causing my death as painlessly as possible A few days before Xmas I drop her off at the local mall to buy gifts I ask her again as I had for years to please take some time to talk to me about the miscarriage and how Ive not been able to sleep without flashbacks for four years and how I wish she would consider couples counselling Just like everytime I had asked before she tells me to get fucked and that Im the only one with a problem Im thinking "ok well I guess this is my last Christmas" Then she says the words that change everything "I wish youd grow a spine and stop being such a bitch That baby wasnt even yours" It was like a light switch had been flicked I asked her why she would keep that information from me and let me suffer for four years knowing that maybe there was a slight chance that confessing that lie might give me peace Her response: "Whats done is done" I couldnt believe my ears And on that last sentence she turned and walked away to buy me my Xmas present My Xmas present was a Big Mac meal by the way She spent the majority of the present money for me on a $40 glass bong for the local drug addict that she was fucking So anyway right after she left my thoughts changed from suicide to escape Im not sure why it was that the final bit of info she gave me changed my whole outlook Why that one sentence was more effective than the cheating the lies the hitting and the verbal abuse Its been six years and I dont have that answer All I know is that at that moment I decided that I was done and needed a way out that didnt end with her getting zero consequences my life insurance and a lot of sympathy I decided though that I would wait until after Christmas so my son could enjoy one final Christmas with his whole family together So I waited January 5th 2015: D-Day for my marriage My wife had been at her drug addict boyfriends house for a few days now I get a phone call from her asking that I please take her and her boyfriend to the local courthouse that was a 30-minute highway drive away so he could answer to charges of assault and theft At first I thought "Why on earth would I do that?" Then it struck me Every time I had ever mentioned divorce in the past she would scream at me that I was a worthless piece of shit who needed to take my head out of my ass Throw her wedding ring at me and runoff for a few hours until I felt bad and then shed come home and "forgive me" for thinking so negatively about our marriage This gaslighting happened a few times and most of the time it worked Id always be left trying to figure out how I came out looking like a bitch So this time I decided I would break up with her in the car My son was at school and I was on leave she had nowhere to run while the car is zipping down the highway at 100kph so it was a perfect time So we get about halfway there and I casually tell her Im done Ill help her find a place give her the kid 5 days per week and give her child support immediately It was effectively cheaper than daycare and I had to save myself before I could save my son I have 100% custody now but thats another story Anyway shes caught completely off guard and agrees to everything because A) she thinks shes getting a pretty good deal and B) she doesnt have any other options So she says "Ok if thats what you want" I tell her I do and that Im tired of fighting She asks me if theres anything she can do to change my mind but I knew that would just be inviting more lies and abuse so I tell her "whats done is done" mic drop I drop her off at the courthouse and start driving home On my way home I call my mom and in a huge emotional release tell her that Im separating from my wife My moms reaction?

gzaej72,njrvgm,I was casually dating a woman for a few weeks After a date we were on a nice walk and talking about what we see for ourselves in the future Now one of the things that initially attracted me to her is how ambitious she seemed to be She had many interests and pursued them fully Well on this date she mentioned that she wanted to be a mom some day and asked if I wanted kids I come from a huge family so I told her I wouldnt mind having kids of my own but im not set on it either way Her response: "I want three kids like only exactly three kids And I want to be a stay-at-home mom You would have to make enough money for the family because I wont work" Mind you we lived in a large very expensive city where it was hard enough just to live a comfortable single life Yeahthat was my cue to exit,Legendary_Brown,16218740260,5

gzc2rcv,njrvgm,So many red flags youd have thought he was digging over a gas line on a golf course First date Dude asks me to meet him in the city after work Weve been chatting on OKC for about a week we get along well and he seems nice But I dont like the city especially at night And parking is insanely expensive I tell him that and he makes up some dumb excuse about loving the lights or something and tells me he will pay for parking I agree I show up and this dude is way too well known at both bars we went to Like beyond regular status and not just by the staff Its a little eerie But I shrug it off Maybe hes a popular guy He asks to take a picture of me Not *with* me (not that it wouldve been much less creepy honestly) but *of* me as soon as we sit down He starts going on about how his friends would never believe he was with someone as hot as I am Then he starts calling me "the unicorn" because I worked as a junior engineer play video games and love horror movies It gets obnoxious fast Like he doesnt use my name just refers to me as "Ms Unicorn" 5 minutes in and he asks to kiss me We havent even gotten our drinks yet I decline He introduces me around the bar to everyone as "Ms Unicorn" I wonder if he has forgotten my name He asks to kiss me several more times At one point he goes to get more drinks He comes back and presses weirdly close to me when he drops my drink off Instead of setting it down in front of me like a normal human being he kind of leans around me and presses up against me in a thinly veiled attempt to feel me up I feel his erection against my leg I am repulsed I try repeatedly to end the night early He has excuse after excuse Waiting for someone who owes him money wants to see the score on the game blah blah blah Eventually I shrug and say fine and just leave He races out and catches up to me on the sidewalk to "walk me to my car" When we get there he gets in the passenger seat I ask what in the actual fuck he thinks hes doing He explains that he "cant drive right now" because "reasons" which certainly arent getting his license suspended for a DUI He tells me I need to drive him home since he "didnt get what he paid for" Stating that he meant the expensive parking implying he meant me I grimace but whatever I agree to drive him home When it comes time to pay for parking he does not have nearly enough cash and no card I am forced to pay He lives almost a *fucking hour* away He most definitely did not tell me that Too late now On the ride home he tells me hes "in love with me" Dude has spent a grand total of 2 hours with me including the awkward car ride I tell him he needs to stop He insists He says he "just knows" and that he can "tell I have a beautiful soul" I vomit in my mouth a bit metaphorically speaking Eventually we arrive at his creepy run down house I pull into the driveway and tell him goodnight He tries to kiss me I push him away and tell him to get out of my car He starts to cry I repeat get out of my car He goes on a sobbing tirade about how "his heart just gets in the way" and he "falls in love too soon" He proceeds to start punching himself - hard - in the chest and legs I tell him again to get out Suddenly the porch light pops on and an older woman comes out He gasps "sorry I live with my mom I didnt tell you in case you wanted to come in" Snot muffles his half assed apologies "Get out! Now!" He starts begging me to "give him a chance" I roll down my window as his mother approaches "Please get him out of my car" She opens the passenger door and tries to pull his arm He swats her away then slaps her hard "Come on *name* you cant be doing this to girls all the time Come on inside now" She is undeterred by the slapping He is still in my car "If you dont get out right the fuck now I WILL call the police" That seems to snap him out of it Or maybe into it? He stops crying and lets his mother drag him from the car I pull out at lightning speed and catch a glimpse of him running after my car in the red glow of tail lights Nothing in the world would have made me stop,z0mbiegrl,16219017370,6

She was wailing on about how it wasnt fair that she had to pay bills and take care of responsibilities first and THEN do the things she wanted to do like go shopping play games eat out at 5 star restaurants etc I stood there in the bedroom watching this half hour long tantrum and just thought "Ooooooh fuck this this is not going to be a good thing for our lives" At the moment the last few months of experiences came together and I realized - she was just like her parents and if I stayed that was probably going to be us I noped out of that relationship real quick divorced and on a plane back to Texas all in the span of three days The marriage ended as quickly as it began,ecks-wye-zee,16218790090,4

There are no more wandering bedouins as everyone lives in settled homes People still go camping in tents to preserve tradition Camels are very expensive to own and theyre not a common sight in or around cities 3) Saudis are terrorists or terrorist-sympathizers Americans seem to especially believe this I think because Bin Laden was born and raised in Saudi Arabia The fact is Bin Laden had been a wanted criminal fugitive since the 90s who for various socio-political reasons managed to persuade younger more gullible people from Saudi Arabia and other countries to follow him to Afghanistan where he orchestrated the tragic 9/11 attacks In fact Saudi Arabia itself has been the target of multiple terrorist bombings by Al-Qaeda in 2003-2004 (Riyadh Khobar Yanbu) and later ISIL in 2015 (Qatif Damman Abha) I see a lot of comments on reddit about how the US "should have bombed the Saudis" and it makes me upset,StrawberrySheikh,16188751850,3

gv2dbps,mttmmx,That were a corruption-free Scandinavian welfare paradise (Sweden) and alternatively that us not being that anymore would be tied to immigration Sweden used to be the archetype of a Scandinavian welfare society We went from being a poor country in the outskirts of Europe to having a pretty solid economy a healthy population and a common instinct of acting together as a democratic society and caring for each other Thats really not the case anymore and it hasnt been for at least 20-25 years When you look at our train infrastructure our electricity infrastructure our schools our nursing homes our elderly care etc were falling far behind most of Europe We rank very well on the "percieved corruption index" but if you scratch the surface on any deal concerning tax money youll find huge amounts being shuffled into the pockets of friends and family of politicians Its just hidden corruption so unless you work in a relevant field you wont be aware of it (hence our low level of "percieved corruption") It all started in the 1990s with Sweden effectively deciding to adopt all of Thatchers policies without really preceding it by any debate We still consider ourself to be a social democratic mixed economy but for some reason pretty much every government service is now entirely or partially carried out (usually extremely poorly at a high price) by some private subcontractor We have a working class declining in size and a middle class growing in size so of course low taxes and high subsidies is key to political success The middle class have seen large gains in disposable income and because were all convinced that our schools and our hospitals are "world leading" (because they must be were Sweden after all) few people think that wealth has come at a price I think that few people want anything to change Its only when you start looking at raw numbers in international comparisons of various services that you realize that we basically have switched places with Italy Greece and Spain in relative terms,thegreger,16188272500,4

gv40w3q,mttmmx,Oh boy where do I even begin? Im from Denmark And BOY do the US just loooooove to bring up Denmark First of Bernie! We are NOT a bloody socialist country! We are CAPITALIST with a social security network But we are actually HEAVILY supportive of people starting private buisness and being entreprenours because we know thats where our tax pool comes from And we NEED that tax pool to pay for our security network! If we didnt have a healty enviroment for private buisnesss we wouldnt have money to pay for social security! Our free universities yes technically we have free universities But they do NOT work the way they think they do Bascially the best way to think of them is that they are an INVESTMENT made by government They look at our numbers and say "In eight years we need this many new doctors and this many new engineers and this many so on and so on" And then they crunch the numbers and THOSE are the exact number of students they will pay for on each course So the number of free spots are limited And well We dont need people who studies gender theories they are not a net benefit So the government arent paying for that shit You CAN study it you can go to any foreign country and study what you want But then you have to pay for that The government only pays for what they think will be a net benefit to our society after the education has been finished and in limited numbers And potential students will fight for those spots Based on grades and knowledge! On MERIT! And I do like that system cause it does mean that truly even if you are a from a poor family If you are clever and can get the grades you can indeed become a doctor But you aint getting free paces because of skin color We cant afford "Representation" we need those who are of a net benefit to our society Otherwise We cant afford social security! At all! Also We have a HUGE focus on health and making people eat healthy and not be obese because guess what A good way to SAFE money on health care and hospitals are by preventing people from getting preventable diseases Diseases that would never have happened if you werent obese in the first place So yeah!

hhjj3gy,qcqv9v,I was eighteen and decided to become a Mary Kay consultant with all the money I had in the damn world ($150 USD)! I was committed I was focused I was READY to make my way in the crazy world of selling shitty overpriced makeup! I was going to GET that pink car! I listened to the motivational tapes (yes they were actual cassette tapes) All my dreams were about to come true! My mother was onboard My grandma was onboard! Here we go! No one bought a thing from me One girl bought some $5 lipgloss out of sheer pity I went into a MLM hun-rage ranting about how "you really know who your friends are nyehhhh" shitty behavior like that I didnt know what to do my higher-up was pressuring me to recruit more salespeople and buy inventory (like $2000) But NO ONE WAS HELPING ME! OMG! In my anger I QUIT the company! I cried a lot and wrote a lot of furious passive-aggressive livejournal posts My higher-up was upset with me but I ended up just losing her number Ultimately I washed my hands of them Yeah I was in an MLM for all of a month and I escaped with my life my sanity my money my parents money my grandmas money and my friends (who were obviously WAY smarter than I was at that time or else they were just broke At 18 its hard to tell) By the time I was 20 I was well aware of the mess I narrowly avoided,floptimus_prime,16348517860,14

hhki832,qcqv9v,Late to the party but oh well This is from back in the early 2000s I had been dating my girlfriend for 7 years We started in high school and then moved in together after I finished college Everything began to turn at that point She couldnt hold a job wasnt planning on going to college and was generally burning through what little money we had every month I was looking for a way out of the relationship but felt trapped due to bills and that general sense of being afraid of change I would lay in bed at night trying to come up with the courage to just break up and move on but I knew I couldnt afford our apartment on my own - what little she did make would cover the little bit that I couldnt do on my own My bank account was regularly overdrawn to buy groceries and I was skipping bills in order to survive I was not in a good place mentally or financially We argued all the time Little things here and there Petty things She was fond of throwing things at me banging her head into doors or walls all while screaming at the top of her lungs Eventually things came to a head when I was woken up one night by the police knocking on our door They showed up and said they were responding to a domestic disturbance I figured one of the neighbors heard her having a tantrum and called I was mortified Unfortunately the police made the general assumption that I had beaten her which couldnt be farther from the truth They checked us both for markings and found nothing however I was still hauled off to jail In my pajamas Barefoot She never once attempted to tell them that I had not touched her which was the biggest betrayal I have ever felt Her own mother came to the police station and told them her daughter was being a stupid cunt and that if she had any suspicion that I had laid a hand on her daughter that I deserved to be in jail but that shes knows I did not She was my saving grace They released me the next morning and no charges were filed against me The county prosecutors office did however inform me they would be filing false reporting charges against her Turns out she had called the police set her phone down so they could hear and then put on her best performance (she had always been a fan of going from 0 to 100 in an argument) At this point I was through with her and I packed my things and moved out Later that year I began dating someone who is now my wife My ex ended up with one of my friends who I obviously dont speak to anymore To my knowledge she is now a smoker still hasnt gone to school still isnt making any money and has still not really made it in society My wife and I both have high paying careers own a home on some acreage living debt free traveling all over the world and are enjoying every second of it,Mother-Fucker,16348680690,7

hhj4jmg,qcqv9v,I dodged three nukes with one bad decision that saved my life my sanity and my future In the 90s I had my heart broken by an ex I had rescued from a bad relationship and moved back to my hometown with After my stint in the USN she had started contacting my grandmother I had little money but a decent job and an apartment I left the job to help her She was being terrorized by a guy she had met after we were separated by me being taken by CPS and moved away from an abusive family She contacted my grandma to ask for my help Grandma was the only person in the family that I spoke to I called her and agreed to help her get her things back We ended up together for 6 months before she called it off after reconnecting with her trashy hometown friends and hooking up with a guy at the E-club in San Diego I tried to contact her a few times She told me I was a stalker then swore I had broken into her car I had not She made it impossible for me to keep my new job by calling and complaining about me to my boss so I gave away all my non-portable possessions and took a job selling magazines all over the USA I was waiting for my GI Bill and financial aid to start school but why sit there and wait a whole year? This was a bad decision but it saved my ass The reasons for this decision being bad was the crew life We went from city to city state to state selling subscriptions in parking lots and door-to-door It sucked but I was good at it and had some fine adventures Everyone else seemed to be into meth or cocaine or heroin except for two kids from Oklahoma who I instantly got along with I kept copies of every subscription I sold which included the addresses and names of the people involved This quirk (and my habit of keeping every piece of paper for years) would later save my freedom and my future The first nuke I dodged came in Wisconsin Sometimes crews would send a team with a car handler to a separate location (a "spur") I did not get along with the car handler who would lead the spur I told him I didnt want to head out with his spur and he said "Get on or get beat" I had been on the road for almost 7 months by this time and never gotten into any scraps I just didnt feel like half the shit they argued and fought over was worth it But this was and I wasnt going to head out with a hard-drinking idiot who drove like a maniac in the best of times Short version of the dodged nuke: The car handler tried to beat me up and got a busted nose a raccoon mask and a sore set of balls for his trouble The POS tweaker who usually helped him "assert authority" in the past did not wish to join in Three days later the crew manager picked me up outside the Harley factory (after a rad day selling to assembly line workers) and said "Well theyre gone and I wanted you to know before you turn on the TV" The car handler drunk in Minnesota had rolled a van with 10 other young adults inside killing them all Two of them were close friends and the rest were just lost souls that liked things I did not (mostly drugs) The crew manager who was in some ways a decent guy couldnt handle the guilt and offered to get us hired on with other crews He was done with the business But it was time for me to go home and start school in a month so he paid me out thanked me and drove me halfway to CA (to TX) and got me a plane ticket home Along the way we hit a lot of strip clubs bars and pretty amazing restaurants he had discovered near hotels over his years in the business We became good friends on that last road trip Back home I had just settled into an apartment and called a friend to say I was in town and wanted to go buy some furniture I didnt know that the whole time before I returned my ex had convinced everyone I was stalking her harassing her husband-to-be/E-club sleazy hookup While I was gone she had filed for protective orders (which they never served and were thus dismissed) and had regularly filed police complaints about new "incidents" She told the Sheriffs who were trying to serve and find me that I was "hiding out and selling drugs to get by" Within an hour of that call to a friend who truly thought I had gone rogue and underground and was terrorizing my ex my door got kicked in and I was arrested I had no idea what for What I did have was receipts; 7 months of them all over the USA from WA to NC to Michigan What the police had was 5 reports one every month and a half of me assaulting menacing calling or burgling her I was shocked but I was innocent and knew it I kept my mouth shut and demanded a lawyer My Public Defender tried to sell me a deal which I was not having one bit of She demanded I explain how I would defend myself and I mentioned my magazine sales receipts and gave her my crew managers home phone number Two days later the charges were dismissed After that hearing her squid guy served me with her fresh DVRO 10 days later the fresh attempt at a DVRO was dismissed with prejudice when I showed up to the the hearing with receipts and a written and Fedexd letter from my former boss and now loyal amigo Nuke dodged She left state with her POS sailor who had finished his enlistment They apparently had a rocky relationship after the first kids were born She cheated on him often and he has hung in there I have seen pictures of their kids (we still have childhood friends in common and people always want to know about that time in my life) She looks haggard too Two of her kids look like a guy she cheated with from MySpace something I was made aware of by one of the same trashy friends (who is friends with one of my sisters) who took her to the E-club and now gleefully spreads news of her shitty existence She has filed multiple restraining orders against her cheat-exes and a couple against her husband is diagnosed as having a BPD and suffering from manic depression The Nuke I dodged there was that I loved her and I might have even taken her back after she cheated She contacted me on FaceBook and I immediately quit the app completely when I started feeling sentimental Holy crap No lady!

hhim5v5,qcqv9v,So After the death of my father in 2002 my mom didnt have a lot of money so we didnt go on hollidays for the next 2 years my sister was still in Uni and i had just gotten out of elementary school My mom and dad both were teachers so we were used to a more than decent standard of living and 2-3 hollidays a year but times where difficult and we stuck together and even 9 year old me got the message But in 2004 my mom suprised us right after christmas we would go for a vacation! Me and my sister were overjoyed! So we went to a travel agency and my mom told us since it would be her only christmas present to either of us we could decide where we wanted to go i wanted to go far where it would be warm in winter my sister wanted to go to asia because she had never been there So we settled on Thailand This was around October We picked a great hotel 10 days ALL THE GREAT STUFF We were SO ready for that! Then early november rolled around and my moms car broke down And 90% of the holliday budget had to be used for the repair We were absolutely devastated but my mom was determined to make up for it We booked a cheap trip to mallorca as a consolation and left on december 25 There we rented a small car and spent our days driving around the islands discovering beautiful corners i snapped an AWESOME picture of a palmtree infront of a snowpowdered mountain The hotel was cheap as hell we had barely any amenities the only luxuary we had was the cafe de palma every day where we ate cake that tasted absolutely heavenly the whole holyday for 3 people was i think around 500-700 euros at the time it was only a short 5 day trip but it was a great time and i loved fireworks so i was absolutely fine with being back for the 31dec So fly back home unpack and settle back have lunch after which we turn on the TV (our hotel didnt have one and we didnt keep up with the news) And the evening news come up A report about a big tsunami in the indian ocean that hit thailand And then we see the footage from the location which made us all mortified That was our hotel the one me and my sister picked being crushed like it was made of paper by the wave my whole family would most likely have perished if my moms care didnt break down I dont go on vacations outside of germany anymore :|,Ov3rdose_EvE,16348383750,5

On the drive home I said that we did everything you are not supposed to do in that situation but we were lucky about how it all went,23KoiTiny,16349328020,3
hj6uv0j,qcqv9v,I was on the big vacation me and my Dad said wed take for twenty years we were down in Cape Canaveral and it got so where my ankles were swollen I could hardly breathe at night or walk ten feet without getting windedI was so large I could barely fit in a stand out showerwe just thought I was getting fat looking back we shouldve known something was wrong since I could wear a shirt one week and the next it wouldnt fitlong story short we cut the trip short and I went to a walk-in clinic the next dayI thought the ARNP there was going to have a heart attack herself it turned out I was at 90% heart failure and couldve had a heart attack at any moment that I wouldnt have survived Heart failure is when something injures your heart and it cant beat hard enough to keep your circulation going I spent a week in the hospital spent eighty grand in insurance money and came out to a two month recovery I ended up passing about sixty pounds of water I was retaining which was why I was so huge It was a real wakeup call seven years later I am pursuing my calling in life (ministry) and am in seminary So the moral of the story is if you stop urinating have swollen ankles (and everything else below the belt is swollen too) and wake up constantly gasping for breath at night you have heart failure go to the ER or call an ambulance!,LevelSea4340,16359687360,3

hhhjwt0,qcqv9v,Nuke 1: Girl in college I was hooking up with and casually dating Incredibly ambitious; Anna Nalick Hot (ie super sexy when she wants to be) and being involved with me made her look good Luckily I was a huge dick and it didnt work out Her next lover had to be her Bill Clinton to her Hillary and go with her to all these awful vegan rallies and shit Once they broke off she basically ruined him and nearly got him kicked out of college (she was one of those super influincal types) Nuke 2: Rented a condo and they gave me a clause to buy it for 290000 with rent going towards it Not a bad deal but the owner was crazy corrupt He kept the money and never paid taxes electricity and common upkeep Turned out that he never changed the locks (like idential locks for each unit your key could open any lock!) Lots of crazy stuff like frequent robberies etc Long story short the building got repossesed and value crashed Nuke 3: I was supposed to be at Istanbul airport when a bunch of terrorists shot it up Luckily my trip got moved ahead a week,ooo-ooo-oooyea,16348221990,111
hhiehqc,qcqv9v,Not me but my mom She had this suitor who was well mannered gentlemanly came from a good family good looking is of upper middle class the perfect man But my mom turned him down and married my dad who came from a poor family and lived with his parents along with 4 siblings in what was a dingy rundown house made with corrugated iron The perfect man then married my moms sister who is my aunt and things went downhill pretty quickly He tried to devour my grandfathers money and property through concocted up lies and dodgy investment schemes but my grandfather turned him down and gave him nothing in the will This man also has frequent affairs with women from China as he regularly went there for "business" Whats his business? Human trafficking (hopefully the correct term) He will dress up in a suit/formal wear and look for women and girls from poor families in China and impersonate as an official from my country and offer them job opportunities He will then give them falsified documents and then theyll fly to my country which they will be let in because he is in cahoots with some officials of rank in the immigration When these girls arrive in Malaysia what were their jobs? Not waitresses or masseurs but forced into prostitution or sold as cheap labour He has threatened to send his own children to Australia and sell them off as coolies Also claimed to have connections with those on the legal and illegal side in the country Tried several times to get my uncle to invest in a business with him but in reality just wants to scam him He also constantly threatens his own parents by saying he wont provide for his family if his parents dont give him money He ran to Australia to hide when my government begin clamping down on corrupt immigration officers and made arrests and when it died down he came back Nothing can be done because hes still "protected" by some corrupt officials here My dads not perfect he describes his kids as "investment" and only is nice to me when he needs my help but Id rather take that compared to having a criminal as my parent,totallynicehedgehog,16348353220,3

hhinp57,qcqv9v,I had a boyfriend who was the artsy rebellious type He was sweet and loving at first but: * After two or so months he expected me to always be available for emotional support when he was not in a good mental state I remember traveling with my parents and having to stay in the parking lot because there was no phone signal where wed be going * In general he expected me to be available for hanging out all the time and he expected me to always be happy and enthusiastic when I was around him I had started a particularly hard semester in college and we were hanging out every afternoon As expected some of these times I was tired and not very talkative He did not take this well I couldnt tell him I couldnt meet because hed get mad and give me the silent treatment Same thing with online games I \*had\* to spend three hours playing with him because he wanted * NSFW: >!I wasnt taking BC at the time One night he pressured me into having unprotected sex with him When I asked him why on Earth should we risk me getting pregnant at 19 years old and risking my college degree he replied that his own pleasure was more important I started taking BC shortly after!< * He would break up with me about every three months and come back two days later * I got sick for a week I still showed up to school and still met up with him on Friday (we always met on Fridays) Because I was sick I was getting out of breath while walking around town and had to stop and sit a couple times When we got home he told me that I was sick and tired all the time and that he didnt want a fucking baby * After graduating high school he couldnt hold any studies or a job No shame in not going to college but there was nothing he could finish Trade school art school jobs nothing hed drop out in three months That didnt affect me per se but it was hard for me to picture a future together especially considering that I paid for every date and he stayed in my place while I went to class (I lived alone) and ate all of my food leaving me with none for the week * He told me he was going to live with some former roomates of mine who I had had a lot of trouble with * He wanted an open relationship which I was fine with but he did not want me to be with others Open on his side only * He told me that I needed to "seduce him" and put in work to make he like me * He was obsessed with the fact that I wasnt "strong" and would reprimand me all the time for not being strong enough both physically and emotionally * As the final straw he started doing drugs At some point I completely checked out of the relationship just let him do whatever he wanted and whenever he threw a tantrum I just went through the motions and waited for it to pass I eventually dumped him a few months after this Im just grateful that this all happened when I was a student and before I had the money or autonomy to say "hey lets move in together" That would have been disastrous,Rossally,16348390000,3
hhiy27g,qcqv9v,After a few years of teaching I felt that it wasnt really for me and I went and got another masters in library science while working as a permanent substitute in the meantime (perm sub means I work in the same building every day and have guaranteed work) I had an interview for a part-time childrens librarian position and accepted but the pay was low enough that I didnt want to stop subbing so I was going to try to work both jobs The library was an hour away from my house and the shifts were terrible times (5-9 pm Tue-Thurs and every Saturday) so I knew that I couldnt sub 5 days a week and wanted to switch to per diem subbing so I could have a more manageable schedule I told my assistant principal that I wanted to step down as a perm sub and switch to per diem and I was giving him two weeks notice That date was March 13th 2020 the last day both the school and the library were open for that school year due to COVID Since the library was closed the job offer fell through (the library opened again but had limited hours and no longer had the available position) Once this news hit I immediately emailed the assistant principal and rescinded my two weeks notice telling him that the second job was no longer happening While school was closed and eventually switched to virtual it was really unclear what would happen to the subs It was eventually decided that the perm subs would continue to get paid throughout the school closure as long as we attended meetings a few times a week while the per diem subs were out of work I got an email a few weeks in from the assistant superintendent saying that he heard I verbally resigned and then rescinded my resignation and asked me to explain I told him what happened and he agreed to let me stay as a perm sub Had I been offered the library job a month earlier and officially went to per diem subbing I would have been jobless for the rest of that schoolyear and made zero money During that time my husband and I closed on a house and that was only possible because I had proof that I was continuing to make money during the school closure Things could have been very different,Gneissisnice,16348432070,3

hhjk35o,qcqv9v,Super late to the party here but here is my story Buckle up because its a long one I used to be a shy guy Just never really hit it off with talking to people especially girls I would avoid conversations You know the deal I left home to transfer to a larger university and forced myself to transform into a more outgoing guy I was a year older than everyone else Im a tall muscular(ish) guy now outgoing and basically just ooze this natural charisma that I was hiding for years I joined a fraternity to be be around these hot women and hang out with the guys that had the money and threw the best parties on campus Women loved me for the first time ever and I kinda felt like the popular kids from high school I go to a fraternity party and Im talking to several girls but I get absolutely wasted and end up going home with this chick We went for a roll in the sheets (only my 3rd partner ever at the time) It was good and all We see each other a few more times but Im a newly liberated fraternity guy at a campus with nearly 16k other women I want to keep playing the field for a few years and then start settling down in my Junior or Senior years so now is not the time to be getting stuck on one girl I nicely break things off with this chick and it all seems so amicable She still kept coming around the fraternity house which was cool with me I didnt think there were any hard feelings She was always really close by though Like Id be talking to other girls or dancing and she was always like 5-10 feet away by herself just watching me I thought it was a little creepy but whatever Its not the largest fraternity house and the party rooms and outdoor area make it easy to find someone even when you arent looking so I think nothing much else of it After about 2 weeks of this she comes to a party and kinda corners me in a hallway She throws her hand down my pants and tells me that she wants it Still not really thinking with the right side of my brain I take her back to my apartment We have another good time She spends the rest of the night and morning at my place which is kinda normal for me and girls I was with She wanted to have a serious conversation about our relationship and I told her that the hookups were fun but I just wasnt settling down yet It would probably be best if she doesnt make any advancements on me for a little while and Id let her know when I was interested I was kind of a dick but I didnt want her messing up the good times I was having After that she would randomly show up everywhere I was Restaurants with fraternity brothers Walking across this big ass campus The grocery store Even outside my classes I would be talking to a group of girls at a party (most just friends or girlfriends of fraternity brothers) I would walk away and she would make a point to come tell them that I was her boyfriend and off limits At this point I figured she was stalking me and was a bit scared of her One night I was at a friends house pregaming a party I got a text from her asking where I was and then about 3 brothers asked me the same saying she was at the fraternity house waiting on me I told her I was at my apartment and then my roommates started texting me that she had shown up there about 20 minutes later They had let her in and she was sitting at the top of the stairs leading to my room I went to the party and she was blowing up my phone the entire time asking me where I was and sending me nude pics I held off on going back home until 3AM thinking she wouldnt be there but she had passed out on the couch in the living room downstairs by the time I got there I sneaked by her and went upstairs to bed I was really careful to make sure I locked the door to my room At around 8AM someone started banging down my door At first I had completely forgot she was there and thought it was my roommate trying to get my attention I opened the door and she ran in my room and started screaming at me asking me where I had been and if I was cheating I calmly spoke to her with all my roommates and their girlfriends awake outside my door I told her we werent dating and we had agreed to that a few weeks earlier I told her she needed to leave She wouldnt get up I about walked over to her to grab her by the arm but thought better of that I just had this feeling she would try to tell people I was abusive or something We had to call the cops to get her out of there As the cops were making her leave she told them that I had grabbed her and hit her Thankfully my roommates and their girlfriends were right there to call her a liar and I showed them the text from the night before A week later she showed back up at the fraternity house in the middle of the day and wouldnt leave unless I talked to her I happened to be walking in for lunch about that same time She hit me with the "Im pregnant and its yours" line I called BS immediately because I didnt cum in women back then like ever I pulled out because this was a chief worry of mine I wasnt about to have a kid out of wedlock but I wouldve done the right thing I drove her straight to the pharmacy and made her take 3 different test with me back at the fraternity house All came back negative She tried to tell me those werent perfect so I told her we would go to the campus health center and have them do it If she refused that or refused to show me the results while there Id know she was lying She refused I used the police report and testimonies from everyone else to help me get a restraining order which she broke multiple times while on campus and it resulted in her being expelled from campus A year later a man showed up to our fraternity house asking for me and it was her dad He told me my name had come up a lot while the girl was in therapy and he wanted to know what had happened I filled him in on all the details which is tough when you are telling a dad that you had sex with his little girl Turns out she had only ever had one relationship before me that had lasted for 3 years and ended on her senior prom night the Spring before she came to college and met me It ended when the guy she was with got into a car wreck going to pick her up to take her to prom He had died just after she got to the hospital The guy apparently looked a lot like me and the dad felt that she had tried to fill in that hole in her heart with me It was kinda sad honestly I felt horrible for her and her family having to go through all this mess She hasnt had an easy life since as I understand it from some of her friends She married a guy about 2 years later and they both constantly cheated on each other They both figured having a kid would fix the marriage and it didnt The girl lost her shit and about committed suicide when the guy showed he wanted a divorce He ended up keeping custody of the child because of her antics She then tried to commit suicide again Shes back living with her parents Totally sad story and I hate I was a part of it I know if I had actually gotten her pregnant that I would have lost out on a lot in life due to an unhappy marriage I wouldnt have my career my actual wife or any of the great memories that came after she was in the picture I know Im super lucky about it all,brantman19,16348522150,3
hhjle89,qcqv9v,I was interviewing for 2 different jobs One for a small startup ~30 employees The other for a more established company Part of the startups interview process included a 2 HOUR deep dive on my past work experiences where they literally made me take a walk down memory lane and answer all these questions about all my past jobs name my managers and colleagues and describe all my highs and lows Okay Odd and deeply personal in some ways But I went with it Overall both sets of interviews with both companies went really well and we moved on to the references stage The startup proceeds to ask for 6 references naming EXACTLY WHO they wanted to speak to (including my manager at the time) - the people theyd wanted me to name and talk about about during my 2 hour deep dive interview Okay super weird and annoying that they wanted me to reach out to people I hadnt seen in 7 years so they could talk to them But fine I mostly did it- replacing some references with others eg my manager All my references end up mentioning how half the call was spent talking about me while the other half was the startup trying to poach my references Jesus wtf? I eventually got both offers and started weighing the pros and cons to make my decision A day or so after the startup tells me about my offer they send me an email: "Thought wed send some Friday cheer your way :)" with an attachment I open the attachment Its a zoom screenshot with everyone I interviewed in the frame each of their hands are forming a different shape which I finally realize are letters - meant to be spelling out my name Alrighhhhhht then A day later Im talking to my partner and making dinner when my phone rings I dont recognize the number so I joke that its probably one of those robot calls claiming that I owe the government money - and I pick it up Its the startup CEO calling me at 8pm asking if I have any questions or want to talk things out to help with my decision Cool cool cool At this point this company seems to be so invested in getting me to take the job and a part of me truly feels like I owe it to them to say yes But I end up taking the other offer after going through lots of deliberation pros and cons A week later one of the employees who interviewed me reaches out to me on LinkedIn They tell me theyd just left the company We connect and set up a call - Im so curious why they left when they seemed so happy During the call they proceed to lay out how toxic the work environment was and how it took everything in them to not let that show during the interview Everyone worked till at least 7pm each day and this particular person would barely break for dinner before they had to be back in front of the screen The CEO had everyones phone number "just in case" and it wasnt uncommon for then to call employees at 10pm 11pm because of an "emergency" that "just couldnt wait till the next day" They would discourage people from going out of the office for lunch (pre-pandemic days) because "what if other people end up wanting to leave the office too?" If anyone complained about being overworked they were gaslit or reminded that "this is a startup" They had mandatory "happy hours" on Friday that STARTED at 5pm went till 7pm after which people would continue working to wrap up for the week If anyone wanted to take time off theyd be reminded that "this is a startup" or accused of not caring about their teammates or told that it was too short notice Everything was urgent all the time And anyone who worked overtime weekends or during vacation or holidays would be propped up and given kudos So yeah I guess saying no was the best decision I had made in while?,Agitated_Society7853,16348527810,3

hhj0z9r,qcqv9v,My dad died: here me out My dad died when I was younger and of course it was absolutely devastating A parent dying flips your life upside down and you have to deal with the gut wrenching feeling that your life will never be the same My parents were divorced so my mom became our sole caregiver Fortunately my dad was smart and insured that his life insurance policy would go towards myself and my brother for college (we also received gracious donations of money from family and friends of the family) As I grew older and could understand my mom began to tell me more as to why my parents divorced how he had been verbally (and on occasion) physically abusive Soon hearing those stories I started to put two and two together and realized that a lot of the things my father would do with my brother and I were pretty manipulative and abusive to kids Telling us things we as children should never hear about (war how our mom didnt love us how he still loved our mom but what she did was unforgivable etc) basically trying to drill it into us that our mom was at fault for the situation he was in A lot of the stories hed tell us would pose him in a good light while my mom just happened to have a completely different experience cuz obviously dad was an abusive narcissist on the day he died he was complaining about how other people around him werent speaking English and how "this is America speak the language" He was part of that crowd So it may be safe to assume he may not have fully approved of the man Im currently with The most fucked up part is if he had not died I more than likely wouldnt have been able to afford the 4 year college experience that I did I wouldnt have the degree I do wouldnt have been able to move out of state in prospects of a better life wouldnt have been able to travel abroad to another country for schooling bought a car or put a down payment on a house Had my dad not died my life would be completely different and thats absolutely terrifying The phrase "everything happens for a reason" holds so much weight to me since its literally the epitome of my life Though he was far from perfect I cant help but feel at least some sense of immense gratitude for the situation Im in even if that meant I did lose a parent TL:DL Abusive dad died had he not died my life would be a 180 and more than likely shitty and a financial struggle,mweaver122994,16348444050,2

hhj1uoy,qcqv9v,I had an unexpected and quick discharge from the military after serving for a several years (undiagnosed PTSD) Having been in for so long intended to take a few months or a year off from working - just to live A close military friend said some guys were looking for someone to transport some drugs locally (10-15 mile distance) This friend was very social and had some legitimate connections to street drugs/dealers I declined the job offer because (1) I didnt need the money (2) my legal profession was in pharmaceuticals (3) I dont fuck with the DEA!

hhjizk2,qcqv9v,I have a good one for your Im an internationally renowned whisteblower from the USA but relatively unknown in my country because its ran by a bunch of criminals I blew the whistle on the US military drone program in 2012 December 21st actually Though the article in Der Spiegel came out on the 17th the daily mail and business insider printed a tabloid piece that mistranslated the German piece Im 2015 I was given the Whistleblower Award by the German Federation of Scientists and Lawyers Against Nuclear Arms The same award that was given to Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning I however didnt release anything new I simply connected the dots that the government already had out there I testified in German parliament of the role of Ramstein AFB in the illegal drone war and surveillance of world citizens I also spoke at the United Nations as well as I was one of two Americans who showed up to a council to determine international law of robotic and autonomous warfare During this time one of the officers who came into the drone program after I left and whose wife is a lawyer for Raytheon and Johnson & Johnson started stalking me and making YouTube videos claiming that I am a paedophile death cult leader who used the souls of the people I killed to give me supernatural powers This dude is literally insane Fast forward to Autumn 2019 I start going to my local city council meetings because the mayor and council got caught red handed using a thing called tax increment financing for pet projects as well as using their power to ruin the lives of anyone who came to speak against the actions of the elected officials A few veteran friends and local once middle class did our research and went to battle Being my background as it was I tried to get through to them But one day I was telling a story and none of them were paying attention so I used my staff sergeant voice Meeting was adjourned and a few weeks later I decided that what we were doing was wasting time and we needed to go up the chain of command Late January 2020 there is a warrant out for my arrest February 11th I turn myself in to the police and spend the next 30 days in jail part of it in isolation The charges were "threats and intimidation of a public official" They put my bail at $100k twice the legal limit under the Montana state constitution Mind you this last Monday a man was caught having raped and assaulted a woman nearly to death and was given a $50k bail I got out the day the lockdown happened My mother gave up her retirement But you wanna know where all my support was?

hhilllh,qcqv9v,A couple of years ago I was the head of a team at a startup that spent its first few years getting super popular but had been doing poorly for about a year or so I had a lot of insight into the performance of the company and knew they werent long for this world so I had made it clear I wanted out but couldnt find anything else at the moment to jump ship to They were also riddled with sexual harassment claims and had debt collectors constantly calling/knocking on our doors which shouldve been a red flag for all involved So the day comes that they do a "small" layoff of about 10-12 people but the ones they let go were pretty massive arms of the company or even friends of the owners (the company employed about 200 people at the time) So I walked into HR asked if I was let go and they were flabbergast I even asked - insisting that this was a small necessary layoff in order to really kick business in gear and that they were planning well into the year ahead and beyond I saw right through the bullshit and asked that if they so happen to have another layoff that they put me on that list The head of HR was surprised at my request but we were pretty tight so I think there was a mutual understanding of what I was asking/implying and he said "Sure" Sure enough not two months later there was another layoff and I get the word that I was getting let go with full severance and two years of unused vacation time to be doled out to me in 3 separate payments (the company couldnt afford to pay it all at once) On my way out I told my team to look for something new immediately as this was likely the last layoff they were going to have I dont think any of them believed me as they were SURE that another much larger company was going to buy them out and theyd cash in their stock options and become millionaires I wished them good luck and skipped my way out of there and shortly found a better job It didnt take long until the company went completely bankrupt and the entire staff was let go without severance or any sort of payout We found out they were about $100M in debt and had a complete restructure Most of the folks who were left out to dry couldnt find work for more than a year and the few who did ended up at places with major pay cuts I kept warning them well after I left the company as they were my friends but no one took heed and you can tell theres a bit of remorse for not seeing the writing on the wall the entire time I dodged a major nuclear bomb by not having to move away from my high cost of living city and giving myself the money and time to find a job Ive been very happy with for a couple of years now I just wish the others had listened as well,japars86,16348381490,1

hhimo2j,qcqv9v,My wife and I were house hunting in late 2019 The market was already starting to get out of control but we felt - at the time - we were so lucky to have secured a contract with a really cute house which had been recently renovated that had everything we wanted: big back yard with large trees no one behind us 3/2 with gas range hookups a spacious garage that could double as a workshop and a quiet "old" neighborhood Our realtor convinced us to get an inspection despite the fact that the house had been quite modernized Oh my god I am so happy we did it The roof which had been "replaced" had been installed completely wrong Like literally shingles falling off two enormous dead trees in the front yard the water heater was leaking and fifteen years old massive issues with the foundation that the flippers had tried to fix but also hadnt done properly - just cheaply All of the "major" repairs that needed to be done with City approval the permits hadnt been pulled leaving us the new homeowners responsible for any fines had the City found out The house was listed at 150000 We would have had to probably another 50k into the house to actually get it to be livable As anyone can guess we backed out of the contract and saved any other interested people from the same nightmare/money sink because the inspection stays with the house until its sold In the end we ended up buying a new build Call it a cookie cutter if you want but theres so much peace of mind in having warranties on literally every part of the house,WooksytheWookie,16348385810,1

h1954q8,nvl2dd,I grew up in poverty in a high crime neighborhood and had a parent taken from me young so I had to grow up fast I guess you could consider me "disenfranchised" but Ive never felt that way These books helped me achieve everything Ive wanted so far and I actually apply the concepts in these on the daily: *The Autobiography of Malcolm X - Alex Haley/Malcolm X* -The most comprehensive account of a profound man who lived an absolutely incredible life Makes me sad because although he held some crazy views at one point he makes it clear that his paradigm for life was one of change and growth and he was killed while undergoing the biggest metamorphosis of his life I really think hed be a great mind to have today to cut through the noise of recent events -Gave me a core set of beliefs that really led me to understanding who I am Also shows you the benefit of honesty at all times and how much that helps you become a person of substance No more white lies no bullshit -Helps with perspective on adversity and how you can use it to gain an edge *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck - Mark Manson* Outstanding easy read that helps you direct your effort and attention -fucks- only to things that matter to you Very important in this day and age for young people to understand how to find their direction *The Millionaire Next Door - Thomas J Stanley* The most important book Ive ever read for financial responsibility Quick read that Gives you an entirely different view of money Monies are not fun coupons It is a resource not to be squandered Interesting page turner that gives you the formula to become a millionaire if you have enough discipline and patience you can get there And its not some Tony Robbins alpha male bullshit its a truly honest and proven path to financial freedom and gives you countless examples of how most millionaires in the country (80% of whom are new wealth) do not appear it at first glance They drive normal cars shop at GAP and Costco their kids go to public school and they thrift as if they lived paycheck to paycheck It even shows you how they buy cars use credit and countless other things I used it when I was just starting my business on the side and working full time at a bar to spot whales that got me initial funding and credit Amazing *To Sell is Human - Daniel Pink* You might think you can skip this because youre not in sales but its quite the opposite Basically *Death of a Salesman* is bullshit and everybody is in sales today essentially as in; if you want success in business you must persuade people almost constantly this shows you the best and most natural way to do so Caused a measurable increase in my monthly sales totals Anyway these are the ones Ive found most profound that have shaped the lens through which I view my life But My quest to be a success was born of want because I never could do things or get things I wanted or sometimes needed as a kid and I swore to myself that my kids still have everything they need and I needed to complete my journey so I can teach them how to navigate their world to build their own success with the peace of mind that if anything happened to me theyll always have a safety net So if thats what youre after these books WILL get you there in time Baby steps!,JoltyJob,16233089680,2

hsjhlb9,s34d9b,A couple things for new nurses I have been an emergency nurse for 35 years 3 years working as a staff nurse in 2 different urban trauma centers 05 years as a travel nurse 1 If they do not have a new graduate program look elsewhere You want an orientation to be a minimum of 6 months especially if you are going into ER or ICU 2 If they have a 2 year employment contract That means you have to pay a lot of money to quit your job Some contracts dont require you to pay if you are moving X amount of miles away 3 Are there are senior nurses still working there? If there arent that means a few things They might cap pay or cap PTO/vacation hours meaning the hospital doesnt bother retaining experienced nurses This could also mean poor staffing There is a certain amount of staff required for safe body mechanics when moving a patient Older nurses wont stay somewhere that expects you to move an obese or bed bound person on your own 4 What is the turnover rate? If the average nurse isnt making it more than 15-2 years look elsewhere This could also mean insufferable management complete disregard for labor laws (unsafe staffing working without breaks) workplace aggression from other nurses/doctors/management and no safety measures or consequences for violent patients 5 You want a union TRUST ME 6 Do the nurse to patient ratios actually match the recommended ratios set by the ENA?

hsjsy18,s34d9b,I went to a job interview out of office at a Cafe once with the IT fella We talked about how the business could use a great database that could track relevant and useful data We both geeked out hard discussing the sort of parameters and reports that could drive up the general understanding of who was using the business how they were making money and how to make more Legit we were both bouncing in our seats yelling "Yeah yeah yeah! And also!" He called me an hour and a half later to exclaim he had returned to work super jazzed and decreed to the big boss that he HAD to hire me I had an interview with the big boss the next day but consider it a formality! The writing was on the wall the moment I walked in I did my best brought up the points I had the day before how it could raise profits added on the other points Id thought of the night before and he smiled and nodded and thanked me for my time and told me they would totally call me sure thing any day now thanks for coming in and I was dismissed On my way out I saw the IT fella He told me how excited he was to get started on our database when I started Are you fucking serious? LOOK around you You have 20 male coworkers and 5 female coworkers Out of the 5 female coworkers not a single one is over 22 Not a single one less than 510" Not a single one weighs more than 115lbs And the worst part is that probably at least one of those young ladies fucking rocked at her job and nobody fucking noticed because thats not why she got hired But somehow this bright fella worked in a place like that and literally thought it was *a total coincidence* that the women he worked with were all ex models,kifferella,16421136760,1
