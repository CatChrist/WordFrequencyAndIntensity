h42pxkh,odkp21,The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Natures God entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among these are Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness--That to secure these rights Governments are instituted among Men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it and to institute new Government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness Prudence indeed will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed But when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such Government and to provide new Guards for their future security--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States To prove this let Facts be submitted to a candid world He has refused his Assent to Laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend to them He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual uncomfortable and distant from the depository of their public Records for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people He has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers incapable of Annihilation have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without and convulsions within He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices and the amount and payment of their salaries He has erected a multitude of New Offices and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people and eat out their substance He has kept among us in times of peace Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation: For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us: For protecting them by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States: For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world: For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent: For depriving us in many cases of the benefits of Trial by Jury: For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province establishing therein an Arbitrary government and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies: For taking away our Charters abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: For suspending our own Legislatures and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever He has abdicated Government here by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us He has plundered our seas ravaged our Coasts burnt our towns and destroyed the lives of our people He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death desolation and tyranny already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren or to fall themselves by their Hands He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages sexes and conditions In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity We must therefore acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our Separation and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind Enemies in War in Peace Friends We therefore the Representatives of the united States of America in General Congress Assembled appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions do in the Name and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies solemnly publish and declare That these United Colonies are and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States they have full Power to levy War conclude Peace contract Alliances establish Commerce and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do And for the support of this Declaration with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence we mutually pledge to each other our Lives our Fortunes and our sacred Honor,Commercial_Bake4667,16254414110,2

Jada really controlled that whole narrative as well as how Will was allowed to feel about the "entanglement" He was made a fool of Good loyal men have been emasculated by their wives this shows how someones spouse can ruin them It had nothing to do with Chris Rock and everything to do with him trying to reclaim his manhood in her presence The look on Jadas face after Chriss joke said it all in that moment There were expectations and if Will didnt meet them it would become his problem Will didnt want another televised of him looking like the "pussy husband" but he still laughed at the joke! If it was truly offensive he wouldnt simple as that One look at his wifes face and he knew Jada didnt like it and had to react to safe face Not justifying Wills actions this is what happens when someone is publicly cucked out Jada told the world that she cheated on him to find herself that he couldnt please her sexually told the world that he was a shit father and made it her lifes work to run the "fuck Will" show and thats just whats public Imagine if Will had started fucking one of his daughters friends The joke by Chris Rock lobbed was really soft I dont know what dirt Jada has on Will Smith or what Scientology has done to them but Jesus Copium comes in all flavors Get help Will,imafrk,16486667900,1

gxrokl9,n9jyqk,I was still in college part-time a very young girl and decided I wanted to be a law enforcement/emergency dispatcher That first night the multi-line phone rang nonstop and we also had to work the radio with the officers for three different townships We dispatched EMS and the fire department Oh and we had to deal with the public that came in off off the street and needed to speak to an officer There should have been at least five dispatchers but there were only two dispatchers per shift due to budget cuts The person who was training me did nothing but scream at me for eight solid hours I was trying to learn 10 codes signal codes how to use the NCIC/TLETS computer (TLETS was/is a Texas database) along with everything else this complicated job would entail Those things alone had my head completely spinning but when you add the screaming trainer it was just too much I have always worked best under immense pressure and had been told I wouldnt even flinch at gunfire but I left there in tears vowing that was my first and last night as a dispatcher The next day I went in and spoke with the chief and informed him that no one could learn from a trainer that does nothing but scream and put you down at every turn saying you will never learn anything So I handed him a very short note that I considered a resignation letter He looked at me and asked me if I would stay if I had a different trainer I told him I just wasnt sure telling him how I drove home crying and cried all that night I felt like a total failure There was so much to learn and I had to learn it all in five nights I was scared to death Long story short I had every intention of walking out that night and never coming back but I stayed I was actually the replacement for the screaming trainer as she was being fired I caught on very quickly with the new trainer and in time becoming the supervising dispatcher and then went on to the police academy and I am now a retired sheriffs deputy The moral of the story sometimes you need to look at the job situation like the lyrics of a Kenny Rogers song "You have to know when to hold them know when to fold them know when to walk away and know when to run" Of course there are other times when you should excuse yourself to use the restroom and find a way to get the hell out of there Say "Feet dont fail me now" and show them nothing but dust Please excuse all of these grammar mistakes and run on sentences I am so very tired but just wanted to add my two cents worth Perhaps I should have said a nickels worth I forgot to adjust for inflation,talsnyder108,16207626250,7

Whats that? You go on leave theres no succession planning so youre going to come back to completely destroyed rosters participants who have gone without support and out of date documentation And it wont be Her Majesty the Managers fault for not making sure there was a handover Itll be yours 65 One of my colleagues had to take 2 hours off in the afternoon to get a serious health problem checked She agonised over what to do because she knew shed be coming back to a shit storm If your job makes it that hard for you to prioritise your health and wellbeing that alone is a massive red flag 7 I had four panic attacks in the space of 3 hours on my last dayhad not had a panic attack for about 6 months before that Why? Because I had spent those 3 hours looking for someone to fill an urgent shift and literally no one was helping me I didnt know the system the workers or the participant and the only "help" I did get was when the person training me would tell me not to call the person I suggested because of some weird detail that wasnt listed anywhere This happened several times 8 The way they spoke about support workers was disgusting and they had no qualms trying to manipulate workers to take shifts The thing is I cant blame them because if management werent so aggressive and punitive about not being able to fill shifts they wouldnt need to fucking LIE to get someone to take a shift 9 One HR person One And she was rude as hell 10 Every morning at least 3 people would say to me "oh you didnt run away" Its funny once Multiple times from the same people is a red flag 11 The job wasnt how they described it in the interview or the ad It was sold to me as case management with a bit of rostering In reality it was rostering with a bit of paper pushing on the side Anyway I left halfway through my fourth day and never looked back at that clusterfuck I now work for an amazing start up in the same industry and I could not be happier ,hanxiousandhangry,16207368680,3

h5fql6g,olgt7p,Oh the "costume wedding" Ive never publicly shared this story before I was ordained into the [Universal Life Church](https://wwwulcorg/) back in September 1990 That was back when you had to do it the hard way by sending in a postcard saying you wanted to be ordained None of this "fill out an online form" crap So after completing some more paperwork I wound up being legally allowed to perform weddings in Oregon My first was for a good friend and several others were for [when Multnomah county briefly allowed same-sex weddings in 2004](https://enwikipediaorg/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_Oregon) However I generally avoided weddings unless I really felt it was important for me to be there I broke this rule about 20 years ago I wont explain why but suffice it to say that I agreed to perform an October wedding for a couple I didnt know but a good friend told me they needed a minister They wanted a non-religious wedding at their house I said "yes" The next several weeks involved me trying to get them to meet me for a rehearsal but they always had a reason they couldnt meet Further when I asked about their vows they simply asked me to "write something" OK Ive done this before I can do this The day of the wedding they still hadnt met me except for phone conversations My friend drove me to their placean old house out in the middle of nowhereand explained that it was a "costume wedding" because it was almost Halloween So as we drove into their yard complete with a rusting broken-down pickup truck I noticed they tried to hang "ghosts" in their trees made from white trash bags It looked like a bunch of Klan hoods hanging from their trees As I entered the place I was introduced to "Pocahontas" a very underage girl dressed in an outfit that um clearly revealed she wasnt wearing a bra but desperately needed one Ill not say more but I was not comfortable I was surrounded by vampires cowboys and all manner of curious folk I had a nice grey suit complete with clerical collar and everyone straightened up when I approached seeing as to how I was the minister I smiled and nodded That was the part I was there to play I was introduced to the bride as she was getting dressed but she had no time for me I explained that because we hadnt met I still needed her and the groom to practice their vows at least once No No time she explained She was half-naked I didnt argue I came prepared Ive done this before Im not a _complete_ idiot So as everyone gathered for the ceremony I met the bride and groom and handed each of them a piece of paper with their vows highlighted I explained that I would start and then prompt them to read their portions of the highlighted vows Underage Pocahontas with her breasts hanging out was bouncing up and down next to us I was not happy but I smiled Dressed in a nice suit with a clerical collar I was the only "normal" person there and Ill be damned if Im going to ruin their big day When the ceremony started I started my bit and promptly forgot their names So I referred to them as the "bride" and "groom" hoping that everyone was drunk enough to not notice (they apparently were drunk enough) And then I started the vows When it came time for the groom to read his part he hesitated I tried to discreetly point to his vows on the paper and he started reading but thats when I realized he was functionally illiterate Thats when everyone in the audience learned he was functionally illiterate It is difficult to convey just how emotionally charged this situation was with a huge crowd of drunken cowboys werewolves superheroes and so on standing there holding beer bottles cans of beer or little red plastic cups of wine listening to the groom trying to sound out the words on a piece of paper They were realizing for the first time that the bride is marrying someone who cannot read I had publicly humiliated the groom and he refused to look up from the paper when he finished I ad-libbed a shorter version of the vows so that he wouldnt have to read more I will never forget the horror of that moment Despite all of this we managed to stumble through to "I now pronounce you husband and wife" And because we hadnt rehearsed and I was making this up as I went I didnt know what to do next No one knew to what to do next A hideously awkward silence descended on what should have been the happiest moment of their lives And so everyone looked at me as the minister for guidance Panicking I said in a loud voice "and now its time for a question and answer session" I turned them towards the crowd and stepped back after some brave soul asked the first question It went surprisingly well and the questions fired fast and thick as I slipped towards the kitchen to get away from the mess I discovered to my surprise that it was a BYOB (bring your own beer) wedding They were kind enough to hand me a can of Pabst Blue Ribbon My friend and I retired to the back porch during the celebration and discreetly made a bet about how long the marriage would last Then the back door burst open An angel in white robes with large wings and a cigarette dangling from her lips stormed out cussing up a storm I immediately fell back to my "minister" role and asked "whats troubling you on this beautiful day sister?" "My sister married an asshole!"

h5fajz5,olgt7p,I was less than a year out of high school and my friend had been waiting to get married He and his GF had been together a couple of years he had graduated same as me (last year) and she was graduating this year They were waiting until she graduated to get married condition of her parents I was not a fan of the GF but I want old/mature enough to know that what I didnt like was that she was crazy manipulative gaslighting and emotionally abusive But she was they were both going to enlist as soon as they were married so They had to get married? I wont pretend to understand Anyway she was graduating in late May wedding was scheduled for early June In early April they had a huge blow up and broke up Not particularly unusual they usually did this every couple months so they kept the wedding date just in case Well apparently 2 weeks after they broke up GF had a new boyfriend so 2 weeks after that my friend had a new girlfriend My friend and the new girlfriend kept the wedding date and got married then A week after her graduation a month after meeting and 3 months shy of her 18th birthday (I dont know why but parents agreed) HOWEVER it was a really small wedding and reception Think wedding party total of 8 people including bride and groom and 15 guests total Most of the guests (myself included) were not aware of the bride switcheroo until the new bride came in They thought there might problems if they told people ahead of time I got the whole story from a groomsman at the reception Right then and there I mentally made a bet with myself that their marriage would be over by the time he finished bootcamp He was a good ol boy die hard Republican who had a diet that could be summed up as "BBQ" She was a crazy liberal hippie anti-vaxxer vegan Anyways he didnt end up staying in the military longer than a year they managed to wait about 5 years before having a baby which surprised me and well over a decade later they are still together and seem reasonably happy I seriously still cannot fathom how,N0th1ngRlyMatters2Me,16264588570,9

h5hrtvd,olgt7p,Friends of friends invited as a +1 In hindsight it was a lot of things They were way too young moved way too fast (like dated a year then marriage) and seemed way too perfect (both ridiculously hot also both acted way too kind were the epitome of Southern Baptist hospitality and way too performative- like way too lovey dovey even for a couple) It felt very artificial Thats not what tipped me off at the time They walked out to the song "Im Walking on Sunshine" Groom picked up the bride and carried her out As soon as I heard the song as soon as I saw the groom lift her up I had a terrible gut feeling right there at the wedding I didnt know why at the time but in hindsight I genuinely do not think Ive ever heard Im Walking on Sunshine played in non ironic settings outside of radio As if the song was begging for bad luck As an adult that has better insight than past me did I think I was also subtly picking up small hints Id noticed in other relationships like theirs like how performative their public displays of affection were the very stereotypical "song" they apparently had that was "their song" etc Makes sense after all of my life watching so many of my family members go through first second and third marriages like they were going out of style I had the gut feeling for a while but kept quiet because really I am pessimistic as hell and assume the worst in everything as a defense mechanism and I didnt want to literally break up a marriage over a song so I didnt I didnt really believe in love at the time but because they seemed like really sweet people I really wanted it to work so I wrote it off and kept it to myself kept up a nice smile and buried it deep inside Went to their reception things were okay groom threw the garter and I caught it it all seemed fine Turns out my gut feeling was right because they eventually got divorced I think a week or two later? Maybe longer not sure its almost been a decade Apparently he cheated on her after getting drunk at a party To make matters worse she was pregnant with his child Any time the song came on the radio my friends and I kinda winced and changed it Obviously the moral is "dont get married so quickly and so young" but I think the song picked definitely was a subtle hint to their mindsets at the time and again Im Walking on Sunshine?

h4hqez4,og6dcv,In high school I walked home in the afternoons When I was a freshman I was walking home on one such afternoon and a senior from the band pulled up along side me telling me hed drive me home Now this guy wasnt a bad guy but he was really weird and I didnt feel comfortable getting in Long story short he insists I say no He super creeps and drives along side me for entirely too long telling me to just get in and hell drive me home and now Im at the intersection I cross with a highway (rural Texas so just two lane black top and shoulders wide road but not too busy) to get to my street Not wanting him to follow me home and find out where I live I turn right and walk down the highway assuming he wont slow follow me on that public of a roadway Creepazoid doesnt and drives off so I walk down by an auto shop and across from a gas station I check both ways and begin to cross No traffic from either direction just a truck about eight or ten turns down to my right on the shoulder with their blinker on so I assume theyre turning I mean what person drives in the shoulder past eight or ten right turns instead of getting over close to their intended diversion So I start walking and pass the shoulder the lane the next lane and then step onto the opposite shoulder I still dont know what made me look up but I did and to my right is the truck about a car length from me They were so close I could recognize the driver an elderly family friend For whatever reason the truck was riding the shoulder going 60 MPH in order to turn onto my road Mind you theyd been in the shoulder for a quarter of a mile on this journey blinker on and passing about a dozen right turns to get to their intended stop They didnt stay in the main lane and got over at their stop or a couple ahead they just drove full speed on the shoulder like it was the lane I was dead in the headlights no reason not to be a splatter in front of the old Valero station at the north side of my home town But somehow I jumped off my back foot across the shoulder and into the ditch across nearly the entire shoulder and just face planted as the wake of the truck blew past me No scratches no bruises didnt even bust my ankle tumbling into the ditch like I did I was completely safe,Jack_Empty,16257633790,1

gzwtk6f,nnj3w7,After switching to unconditional kindness instead of getting into arguments that I felt I needed to try to win and never did now sometimes I actually succeed at changing other peoples minds in a positive way If you get into an argument with someone especially a stranger online the best case scenario is usually that they just stop responding An adversarial stance may succeed in embarrassing someone or getting them to restate contradictions but it doesnt allow them much space to move their position publicly So I stopped doing that and instead now make an effort to find common ground and clarify someone elses position before offering any critical alternative Now I actually sometimes get to hear "Oh I hadnt considered that" or "Youve changed how I think about this topic Thanks" Listening carefully to people and taking their concerns seriously just works better I started being kind to everyone by default because I noticed it was more efficient than being negative or overly critical,DerekVanGorder,16223233780,3

gxdijro,n79n8y,Covid specifically my parents indiscipline selfishness and immaturity infecting our entire family with covid if they came back to our country for home leave They are great in some ways toxic or incompetent in others but this is something I warned them about I broke things down for them into bite sized pieces to explain how they will infect us and basically reduce us into prisoners for a month And how they will not learn their lesson and do stupid shit like getting a haircut from a barber the day after they get a negative test result I told them they should not come to our country until things were under control and instead enjoy the freedom of their embassy compound Enjoy the fact they can go to the gym order whatever go for morning walks with their friends but dont come here because you wont be able to sit inside and only go out for essentials Forget infecting people that arent our family they couldnt even show enough care to not risk the health of their siblings and their own children And for what? Did my dad need urgent work completed? No Did my mother need urgent health checkups? No All because they wanted to be religious tourists and travel to visit a fucking temple out of state using public transport Now after their own parents siblings and children are still criticising them for their lack of empathy intelligence and discipline have they learnt their lesson? Nope And guess who knew this was gonna happen back in February of 2020 after Italy and Spain were ravaged?

gxe2f0u,n79n8y,Friend: if you ever need to reject a guy you dont think would take no for an answer tell him youre underage (that works for us because most people guess were 12-14 without any makeup on) Some tips I found online: If you find yourself in a situation where you are being pursued in public *draw attention to yourself* so that the pursuer notices people are watching and would become hesitant to do anything I kept this stuff burnt in my mind because Im always overthinking situations where Id be out in public and suddenly get stalked (PTSD from when it happened to me twice growing up except both times I was walking home from school and there werent many people outside in these neighborhoods) Well when I was visiting Downtown Chicago for a music festival my friend and I ordered food late at night because we couldnt sleep and walked a few streets down from our hotel to get it Some guy pissing in the street noticed us walking out of the shop and started shouting "hey wait up!" while he hurriedly tried to get his pants up and chase after us It was clear that he was interested in my friend and she was terrified She started to run but I couldnt because I was holding our food so I took in my surroundings searching for help and noticed there were quite a lot of people around at 1AM I immediately heard that advice in my head and shouted as loudly as I could "were underage!" back at him to which he abruptly stopped and people around turned to stare They glossed over us and stared at him so he took off,SpiritSleep,16204841550,3

gxe0s8o,n79n8y,Covid Two years ago from December 2019 to Jan 2020 when cases had only just begun hitting China I recalled the SARS crisis of my childhood in Singapore also precipitated by a mysterious incurable virus emerging from China I remembered robot sanitisers everywhere centralised household distributions of provisions and medical supplies temperature checks before entering public places third to fourth degree contact tracing of SARS victims and so on - and knew none of these would take place in an organised non-shambolic fashion early on or ever in the UK I noped it out of the UK immediately and just as I predicted the UK under Bojo completely failed to handle it leading to mass deaths (although its vaccination programme at the end was a saving grace) Asian cities (Singapore Tokyo Seoul Taipei HK) are a good place to be for cleanliness efficiency and safety And fun and normalcy during the pandemic - everything mostly carried on as per normal For perspective Singapore Taiwan and New Zealand have about 05 deaths per 100K people South Korea has about 4 deaths per 100K people Japan has about 8 deaths per 100K people and the UK and USA have about 200 deaths per 100K people,mfabbytwailfr,16204832760,3

gxchfdq,n79n8y,The COVID-19 pandemic Id been closely monitoring reports on reddit re: Dr Li Wenliang alerting the public to a strange new infectious respiratory disease that he was seeing more of in patients; I think Id initially heard about it was at the very end of 2019 or in the first few days of 2020 (it was shortly before or shortly after NYE) My mind went into overdrive about what the possible fallout of this could be and decided the wisest course of action would be to prep like we were headed toward the next Great Depression Wed just closed on our first home in late 2019 and finally had a stable space of our own I continued to monitor the situation and as incidents of the virus to increase we took action by purchasing a chest freezer; I did a shit ton of research about gardening in harsh environments and conducted numerous cycles of soil testing and we overhauled our yard into an abundant kitchen garden with loads of different vegetables fruits and herbs and flowers We stocked up on dried goods and cupboard staples restocked our storage water and all emergency kits; we basically we went into hardcore prepper mode for what appeared to be a disaster We made sure our solar panel system was fully functional (to offset the increased consumption costs wed likely incur by being home all the time) Instead of hoarding paper goods like toilet paper we bought a bidet attachment and purchased a modest amount of toilet paper so as not to put any additional strain on supply chains By the time the first mid-March lockdown rolled around in 2020 wed already hunkered down and had avoided most public places for several weeks (save for a trip to the nursery and dispensary fully masked in n95s in late Feb 2020) Even with all of that preparation the pandemic has been a punch to the gut but we were exceedingly lucky My hyper-vigilance has caused me a tremendous amount of anxiety during periods of my life but in this instance it literally kept us safe and protected us from being exposed to COVID and saved us from unnecessarily contracting the virus and passing it on to others unknowingly Though finances have been tricky and challenging to navigate were still alive and covid-free Overthinking a plate of beans FTW,ek-photo,16204407520,1
gxchqkb,n79n8y,Probably the whole situation with Covid to be honest I remember on New Years Eve 2019 reading about this mystery virus within a week I was carrying hand sanitiser everywhere and using it following going to the shops or public transport because I was starting to get concerned I couldnt see it being successfully contained When I told people I was feeling worried about it I was mostly either laughed at or told it was nothing to worry about I even asked my doctor about it after an appointment some time in February and was told it wasnt anything to be concerned about only the very frail were getting any complications By the time it had started spreading and people were beginning to realise this might actually be something to worry about Id been "over thinking" it for weeks and making little preparations (I made sure I had a good amount of all of my medication had a few emergency meals in the freezer incase the shops were really difficult to get into at any point - that paid off quite well) Just little preparations not that it really eased my anxiety much Once it was announced we were going into lock down suddenly my household didnt find my concern so funny anymore Mentally Id been prepared for that happening for a while at that point which Im actually quite grateful for because I think it really helped prevent my mental health taking such a dip during that time For me since Id been so concerned and following it so closely for a couple of months at that point it almost felt like a relief to see it get taken seriously and to slow down the spread of it,AnxiousSquirrel345,16204409220,1
gxciq5y,n79n8y,I always carried a slip leash in my glove compartment and a card board box old towel and rubber gloves in my trunk in case I came across a stray dog or injured wildlife on the side of the road One day out driving I saw a huge-ass turtle upside down in the middle of a two lane road I swing a U-turn several yards after passing it pull over to the shoulder and grab my gloves Thing is heavy shell is cracked but its alive I noticed its got spines down its tail but dont think anything of it Since I worked at an emergency veterinary clinic at the time I took it to work entered through the back (it was a Sunday so they were not open to the public) and took it to the top floor which saw exotics Doctor and tech there sprang into action when I busted in carrying the thing in my jacket Turns out it was a giant snapping turtle Tech said if it hasnt been so injured it could have taken off a finger Ended up putting it to sleep bc the damage to its shell was too severe,tinkspinkdildo,16204414760,1

gxclv3e,n79n8y,Ive learned that Im not an overthinker and the label is often used problematically incorrect Other people just dont have my capacity to consider realistically addressable problems and explore a solution approach towards a substantially better outcome Or others dont care to be prepared for reasonable things that could happen becausethey just ride on luck or privilege Or maybe theyre just OK accepting bad outcomes they could have reasonably (and comfortably) prevented Other (popular) comments here show me people conflate overthinking with preparedness Its not over thinking to consider how you should handle a situation that could arise and where you wouldnt be able to think clearly when/if it hits: how to exit a room or building if a fire occurred or if an active shooter is around Overthinking to me only has a few forms that are actual negatives: stirring over a problem you wont be able to solve or control or you can clearly address and think through what to do when/if it occurs For example: what if the wings fall off this plane at 30000ft? Yeah you wont be able to do shit to increase your survival in the few minutes it takes to fall "What if the kids dont like the food?" is (usually) not an emergency Buy a pepperoni pizza then "What if my date doesnt like my shirt?" - yup back to nothing to do there Its probably your jokes anyways and you dont have time to learn new ones Otherwise maybe if an overthinker reacts by spending way too much of a resource and creating another problem Could be time like preventing a group from starting a trip because refusal to push forward on reasonable plans; or maybe spending extra money on what-ifs while not having enough for certain and immediate needs Vehicle safety public and commercial travel safety has saved countless lives through "overthinking" Capitalism is what stopped overthinkers from being able to solve the 737MAX sensor problem: "what if this sensor isnt working? What will the plane do? How will the pilots know this is the problem and can they address it?" Turns out twice the answer was "they cant",ebonyseraphim,16204433080,1
gxcmo0b,n79n8y,Went on my first stand up paddle board rental with my SO in the florida keys It was a very very hot day like 104-108 F Id never been in this heat and exposure on a SUP before and I cant remember if I ever was in this level of heat that wasnt in a tightly controlled situation with access to water and shade all around (like a public park) We were planning an out and back to a little island that would cover the whole four hours About 1 1/2 hour out 1 1/2 back in open ocean I overthink water and food situations in hiking all the time This is my greatest fear To be stuck somewhere without enough food or water I dont do calculations but I just go by gut and experience Its always always better to have an extra gallon of water than not enough water especially in hot conditions On a SUP you can tuck extra gear usually under bungie cords on the board too So nbd Anyway I had brought a 2 L platypus bag of water myself for the trip but something told me for the 4 hour rental in the +100 F heat that we needed twice as much I insisted with my SO to buy more (despite the water being very over priced at like $4 per half liter) that he buy 2 L more of water at minimum (I think I might have had also like 1 L more in small water bottles so I had nearly 3 L? NVM I insisted we each drink a fair amount before going first as well) We nearly had a fight over it I told him I was not going to leave the shoreline without it Hed never been in a SUP before whereas I had but only in more temperate conditions I begged and begged and even said Id pay for it and he caved We had like a 10 minute fight about it Suffice to say all that water was gone (we drank it all) before we even got to the halfway point and tbh the entire trip was a bit reckless considering the heat (it was so hot even the ocean water brought no relief) afterwards my SO was thanking me profusely for insisting on bringing the extra water and we both were scared towards the end that wed not make it I didnt even think it would be all gone before the halfway point But thank god I was paranoid Oh wow Im just remembering too - I absolutely insisted he wear a hat and a long sleeve shirt and put tons of sunscreen on in every part of his body He also fought with me on that too (its uneccessary! It will get in the way! Ill take it off!) but at the end was super super grateful Again I was paranoid AF about heat stroke out there on the open water with no shade in that heat again we were SUPing for almost 2 K out and back? No flares no lifeguard And Id never done anything like this before Id only ever SUPd on nice temperate or alpine lakes I was just paranoid and that paranoia possibly prevented us from dying of heat stroke and enabled us to make it back to shore completely exhausted and determined to never do that again,theaftstarboard,16204437920,1
gxcoc90,n79n8y,Oh shit I just remembered a different story so I have to double comment This one comes from being sensitive to smells and being someone who pukes easily So when I travel I always bring a small "TSA compliant" bottle of super strong lavender oil to mask bad smells Id never had to use it on a long trip before after years and years of flying for work and fun although I came close a couple times due to being put near the rear of the plane by the bathrooms and someone droped a duece whose odor wasnt fully sucked out right away (gag) But finally it happened I was on a public shuttle bus ride that takes 3 and 1/2 hours that goes direct from Recife to Porto De Galias a very nice touristy beach On the way home with an hour left to go on the ride a smell began to overtake the bus that was so bad it literally smelled like someone shat their pants and died At first I thought someone farted but it quickly became eye-stingingly bad To make matters worse the only two windows that could open were near the front of the bus and they could only open halfway The bus was only half full but within seconds nearly everyone was saying various things in Portuguese like "Mother of God! What is this Smell?!" "Please open the windows!" "Bus driver has someone died?!" "Do we need to stop?" Right when I started feeling the gag coming I remembered at the last minute that my paranoid self had packed my lavender oil at the bottom of my beach bag I mean I even brought it to the beach thats how much of an over-packer I was So right when my partner said "Im going to ask the driver to stop I cant do this!" I said "Wait I have the solution!" Got my lavender oil out and we literally slathered it on ourselves and then passed it to all the passengers It was strong enough to kill off whatever the smell that was We never found out the culprit of it Ill never forget the looks on the passengers who literally were saying "Thank you so much! You have saved us! God bless you!" It was something I never in my life thought I would ever have a chance to use to save that many people from such a horrific smell,theaftstarboard,16204448060,1

gwmwn1l,n2l1f9,This is a bit of a long story and it doesnt exactly fit with the question but theres this one Webtoon called Gourmet Hound that helped me come to a huge realization Five-six years ago back in 7th grade I was two weeks away from my summer break When I came back home from school one day I had learned my grandpa had passed away My family had known that he was weak and sick for a while but it all happened so suddenly and it was extremely devastating The thought of just "two more weeks" still haunts me today as my mom and I were going to visit him once I was done with school I hadnt seen him for 2 years as we had abruptly moved from LA to Michigan for financial reasons His passing impacted our family heavily But as always time moved on The issue was that I hadnt After the initial bout of grief I had become numb It felt like I was just drifting along through life being pulled by the currents of life aimlessly I tried to ignore reality by getting sucked into video games and the like Fast forward 2-3 years Im still stuck in this limbo I had no one to talk to as I had drifted apart from my old friends in LA and I had just barely gotten to know my friends from Michigan None of them were the type I could discuss these personal issues with I probably didnt even know how to I was just plodding along through life dragging myself through school and seeking company in friends I made online and making a few friends at school I was struggling with my mental health as I couldnt understand at all as of what was happening Eventually with the help of some people I realized that I was depressed But I still had no clue how to really define my emotions And this was where Gourmet Hound came along (I highly recommend that people read this Webtoon and for those that may be reading it already there will not be any spoilers) Gourmet Hound touches upon loss masterfully Theres a moment where a character had defined exactly what I felt when the whole world had moved on despite such a cruel and devastating event disrupting my life It was nauseating to see everyone even myself to slip back into our normal lives after everything It was unfair and there was nothing I could do about it And while this may seem to be a depressing realization the feeling of being able to name my pain was cathartic I finally had the knowledge to understand and organize my emotions All that from me getting into some random Webtoon that I had stumbled across one day Fast forward a few more years and I am doing considerably better mentally and academically Its been a long and arduous journey and I still have a long way to go but I had grown up a ton since then I finally gathered the courage to discuss my concerns and repressed grief with my family members and friends It was a considerable weight off my shoulders and I feel more comfortable with myself overall Basically Im not doing too bad Sorry if this is too rambly and filled with errors Its a bit late and I only just saw this post And thank you if you read through everything I dont really put stuff up like this on public forums but I decided to post this for the hell of it,chrompaxell,16199420700,2

gv7enci,mur1p5,**EDIT:** I feel like I need to clarify that I do not think video calling is useless or unpopular I understand how it has helped out a great deal with medical legal educational and other fields I also understand that the younger generation is a lot more comfortable with casual use of video calls My point is that since the telephone came into widespread usage there was this sense that the change to audio and video was inevitable and that it would be become the "default" way to communicate over distance Until the cordless handset became affordable you were required to be in a specific location to make or receive a phone call and their projections of telecommunications developments of the future were predicated on phones being in fixed locations What Im saying is that I dont believe video calling will ever supplant the text message as the "default" way to transmit short informational messages Video calling may gain popularity for chatting and socializing but the text is more or less here to stay for short messages Nobody wants to go through the "Hi how are you? Im fine Did you see \[that thing\]? So the reason I called is" preliminary thing for simple informative statements If you go all the way back to the 1930s through the 2000s there was this assumption that the public wanted video calling and wanted it to be the default method of contacting people This was completely backward from the truth The overwhelming popularity of SMS/text messaging demonstrated that the public wanted less not more Not saying that video conferencing doesnt have advantages or uses and isnt popular in those spheres but the idea of a video call being the default form of contact is something futurists assumed would be reality that never came to be We definitely have the technology for it - theres just no need to physically lock eyes with someone (or even have to hear them) just to tell them to get milk,GGayleGold,16189291260,10069

h26pbhj,o2hlbv,Try to be Jeffs friend Jeff was a really big deal in middle school We went to different elementary schools so I never even heard of him prior to middle school but as soon as I got to middle school his name was going around the school a lot and it became clear he was a big deal Jeff was the toughest guy in our grade the most athletic the best looking and the coolest according to both the guys and the girls The guys wanted to be his friend and if they werent then they were wary of him because of how tough he was and he gave off that vibe that he wasnt someone to make angry All the girls loved him and he was making out with girls and going out with them all the time He even went out with at least two girls a year ahead of us in school and one of them was the most popular girl in her grade This was basically unheard of but he did it He was in my class in the 6th grade and it became pretty clear that despite his coolness toughness and ability with the girls at a young age Jeff had some problems and couldnt control himself that well He would act out in funny ways by causing mischief and trouble but he would also act out in less funny-yet-troubling ways by doing things like smoking cigarettes on school grounds with other troubled kids and he would occasionally get physical with any guy dumb enough to piss him off Because of this he got detentions and suspensions That year our class had a field trip to some place that I dont remember but I do remember the bus ride to and from the trip Jeff and I were on the same bus and for some reason still unknown to me he decided to sit next to me On the way there he was talking to me about different things and since I thought he was a bully and tough and I was afraid of him I just was nice and would listen and then follow up with questions and try to interact with him and he seemed to be cool with that Then at some point he started talking about his home life and his dad and he said that his dad would hit him upside the head When he told me this he had his eyes averted and sort of looking down and he said it kind of like it was a joke but I could tell that he was upset by it and was trying to play it off cool and by acting like it wasnt some big deal On the bus ride back to school we stopped at some place and there were these vending machines that some kids were getting snacks out of I went to get myself a snack and a drink and I got my drink but something happened when I tried to get my snack I cant remember what it was exactly It may have been that I thought I had more money than I did and when I went to get my snack I came up short for money or it could have been that the machine ate my money Whatever happened I couldnt get my snack and I was upset because I was pretty hungry Without asking him or saying anything Jeff just stepped in front of me and said "I got you" and put a dollar in the machine for me so I could get my snack Then we sat next to each other on the way back to school after that At some point during that year we had a substitute teacher for our class and some kids were acting out and I was laughing because it was funny Our substitute was a middle-aged woman and she was not happy at all She was yelling at us to shut up and knock it off and she physically grabbed me by the shoulders and then started pushing me downward into my chair and desk and I was frightened by it I was scared and didnt know what to do and she was hurting me When class ended Jeff grabbed me by the arm and said "Come on were going to the office" and he basically pushed me and pulled me down the hallway to the principals office I wasnt going to say no to the guy in a million years because I was afraid of him We get to the office and he does all the talking and tells the principal what happened while I just sit there in silence nodding each time that the principal asks me if what Jeff is saying is true See the principal had and would go on to have numerous run-ins and issues with Jeff because Jeff could not behave and kept getting into trouble way too often The principal was wary of him and didnt trust him much and I suppose he had good reason not to However I still remember the concerned look on his face when Jeff was telling him what happened When Jeff was done talking we left the office and the principal said hell look into the incident and thats all I remember I figured that Jeff was just using me to act out and cause trouble or give the principal a headache in having to deal with him yet again I was too afraid of Jeff to say to him that I didnt want to go to the office so what happened happened and that was that Jeff was expelled from school early in the 8th grade Word spread around the school quickly because the kid was such a big deal I dont remember why he got kicked out exactly or what the final straw was He basically disappeared in 2003 and I never saw him againor so I thought He was off my radar for years and I had heard that he got kicked out of his second school after he got kicked out of ours and then in high school he got kicked out of a catholic school and then wound up at a pretty crappy public school I didnt know at the time whether he even finished high school or not In the fall of 2007 I was a senior in high school and I was hanging around at a friends house after a party ended on the weekend Seemingly out of nowhere Jeff shows up with a guy I used to be friends with in earlier years I hadnt seen Jeff since 2003 He was still big looked about 6 foot 3 and still had that kind of socially and physically dominant way about him He was joking around with the guy he came with and he playfully pushed him on the shoulder after making a joke and the guy almost lost his balance and fell over Jeff just couldnt help it Being the alpha male and dominant is how he always was I was sitting on the couch with my friend and the guy who hosted the party and then the guy who almost got pushed over smiled at Jeff a bit and said "You remember [insert my name here]?" and Jeff stared at me for a few seconds I definitely didnt look exactly like I did in middle school but he stepped closer to me and looked me in the eyes and put his hand out to shake my hand but didnt say anything to me Then he went back to drinking the beer he had and joking around Thats the last time I saw him before he died Jeff died a few years ago I think from a drug overdose heroin probably He was 27 I determined that at some point his father who was abusive and likely violent with him when he was a kid left the family likely when Jeff was about 15 or 16 It looked like Jeff and his mom and little sister had to leave our town and they wound up in a crummier more rundown area He fell into the druggie crowd in later years after he was kicked out of middle school and I suppose this shouldnt have been surprising because his older brother overdosed on heroin and died when me and Jeff were in the 7th grade I remember that going around the school at the time and people talking about it in whispers It took me until I was 30 years-old to put my brief-yet-meaningful moments with Jeff together I went my whole life thinking that he was the school bully and I was afraid of him yet I realized eventually that I never saw him bully anyone and that he never bullied me I remembered our time on the bus together and our trip to the office but I couldnt connect the dots at the time Now I realize that on the bus Jeff was grateful that I listened to him talk about his dad hitting him and because I was nice and good to him when I needed help at the vending machines he had my back no questions asked When our substitute teacher did what she did to me I later realized that this happened after the bus trip and vending machines day Because I was nice and good to him when he saw what the teacher did to me he didnt decide to use me as a way to act out and start trouble - he was just trying to help me because he apparently cared and was concerned When I saw him after that party was over in high school he truly did remember me and he remembered those moments we had together where we had each others backs in the 6th grade He could have just said "Whats up" when the other guy asked him if he remembered me but instead of that he moved towards me and shook my hand because even after years of having nothing to do with each other those 6th grade memories came back to him that night but not to me at the time At 30 I put it all together Im truly sad that hes gone and when we were kids I would have never thought that I would say that about him feel that way about him or that he would die young The guy was the biggest deal and the last person I would have thought wouldnt make it in life but sadly his demons and troubles took him away Once I understood Jeff I began thinking of him as a legend of my childhood Recently I realized that calling Jeff a legend -- while accurate and true -- doesnt truly explain and express what he means to me In a life filled with much hurt and pain doled out to me by the people whom I used to call friends and family as well as abuse dished out by others out there Jeff is one of the only people whose friendship goodness and memory is not tainted by time and by how people eventually began to treat me over time All that he ever was was good to me respectful kind decent caring supportive fearless empathetic friendly and true He was never anything bad to me for as long as I knew him and hes the best friend that I never had Thats why calling him a legend doesnt quite express what he is to me all these years later Hes not a legend; hes my hero,thesadredditor,16240015950,721
h2887ya,o2hlbv,I actually know this one First things first lock yourself away and start writing down *everything* you remember about whats coming up EVERY SINGLE THING The more you do the easier itll get Do not go outside create any new experiences or make any new memories until you can get as much down on paper as possible This is important If you have a specialty like maybe youre a huge movie nerd then focus on that You know what movies are coming that are going to be amazing and whats going to flop So lets use that Turns out you can invest in movie productions! That should be enough to earn you some spending cash as well as give you some clout in Hollywood as a tastemaker This puts you in proximity to powerful people and you will likely want for nothing as you watch the years unfold around you (Almost exactly the way you knew it would) BIG WARNING: Its tempting to use your knowledge to help people avoid certain tragedies or to fix problems before they happen DO NOT DO THIS There are people who will think youre from the futureand they will be right You will be rapidly encroaching on the territory of powerful people with a lot of resources If they suspect you *are* from the future you will be locked away in a basement and used as a crystal ball And worse a crystal ball that becomes less effective as the timeline diverges When youre no longer accurate they will kill you Its important to LOSE once in a while Lose big and publicly Like go invest in Waterworld or John Carter,Allcyon,16240351570,3

gveoohi,mvicaw,Covid nurse for most of 2020 Had some that came to the ED for shortness of breath cough etc and tested positive They admitted them and then they would sign themselves out AMA (against medical advice) either before coming to the floor or right after arriving because it was a fake virus the hospital just wanted to make more money by testing everyone etc At the very beginning they actually called the hospitals legal department to see if the patient was allowed to sign out AMA since this was a public health crisis Normally patients that are oriented can sign themselves out even if they are actively having a heart attack etc However the concern was letting someone leave who knowingly has a communicable disease who is not going to isolate wear a mask etc and expose the public to it They said it would be illegal to hold him and we had to let them go With all the mistakes that were made (and many of them made multiple times such as re-opening things and relaxing mask use) I have full confidence that with the next pandemic the officials and a percentage of the public will do everything wrong again Edit: I will add that far more patients had what I termed "Covid regret" That is they admitted they didnt believe the news the doctors etc and were careless and now regretted it One caught it at a party their family had Their elderly sister exposed them all and recovered; my patient died three days later It was a sad realization for many who lived or died and a most unfortunate way to learn,toejamandtoast,16190637930,14

Started yelling (which led to violent coughing and even more shortness of breath) that COVID was "a hoax created by CNN to put Obama back on the throne" and left AMA when he regained his breath My wife reported him to the health dept because he was spewing virus everywhere 2 nights later (on her shift) was brought by ambulance unresponsive and sats in the toilet She tubed him and admitted him to a COVID unit where he died the next day She had a patient in the unit (woman mid-50s) that would beg/plead with everyone to be moved to a different unit She was convinced that COVID was a hoax and that anyone that was sent to a COVID-designated area had been marked to be killed to "reinforce the numbers" and "perpetuate the lie" She likened the COVID units to the gas chambers in the Holocaust and started referring to the hospital as "the showers" and calling all the staff Nazis She even started speaking "German" to the nurses (in reality English with a bad german accent) so theyd let her live She didnt meet protocols but everyone desperately wanted to tu e her During my wifes off-week she was downgraded to the floor and then transferred to a hospital closer to family She never learned her final dispo but assumes she was released back into the public to keep spreading "the truth",Cake_or_Pi,16190519320,11

gvdon71,mvicaw,I am a physician and regularly care for patients with diseases far worse than covid so maybe my perspective is warped If anyone would like a different perspective here it is Just like in others areas of life there are varying attitudes amongst physicians and I have many peers who agree with me The data in the effectiveness of cloth masks preventing the transmission of a partially airborne highly infectious respiratory virus in the community is weak at best And even if they did work It is curious why some are so desperate to believe they dont work both ways (they only prevent the virus from getting out not getting in which from a biophysics standpoint is highly dubious) so asymptomatic bystanders must be mandated by law to conform to the neuroses of those afraid of a virus with a survival rate well over 99% for all comers that mainly kills the morbidly obese and those near the end of their life who would die from a variety of infectious causes should they contract them We should be able to discuss what the value of liberty is in this society and make individual risk assessments about what is appropriate If you are scared you might die from coronavirus the solution is not to make everyone on an airplane wear a marginally effective (at best) symbol that you can see to calm your nerves the solution is to not get on an airplane because that is something you are personally uncomfortable with Its an incredibly selfish and dishonest way of thinking The retort is that X amount have died dont you care about people dying? The uncomfortable truth is that people die from all sorts of things that is the nature of life and when we leave our house and engage in normal life there will always be risks If this virus had a 25% death rate wed be having a different conversation But it doesnt No one wants to think about this rationally and lets be honest there are plenty who love the masks because they are a visual symbol to identify what you believe and they love the fact that they can force other people to wear them in public because they know they hate it This kind of thinking all goes together Only the government can determine how you should act what you should wear where you can go and how you should be able to protect yourself and your family etc It is disingenuous to boil this down to "if you question the efficacy of masks or the constitutionality of mandates regardless of efficacy then you must be a rather stupid person and we should shame and make fun of you" It is much deeper than that and what arguments like that really are are ad hominems that try to shut down debates and bully everyone into agreement There are plenty of my physician colleagues who agree with me and up until last year when masks became politicized because of mandates based on weak/no data it was well understood in the scientific community that only fit tested n95 masks conveyed any meaningful level of protection and that surgical masks offered little benefit outside of a healthcare environment and certainly not homemade cloth masks What changed? Politics Was there a study that suddenly showed people can safely engage in normal activities with masks on? No but there was a randomized trial from Denmark the Danmask study that at the very least cast doubt on the efficacy of mask mandates but it is verboten to discuss it yet we routinely cite far weaker studies on a daily basis The fact that Dr Fauci is wearing his cute masks with cartoons on it after receiving the vaccine speaks volumes Yes you can still get the virus after receiving the vaccine but the vaccine reduces the odds by orders of magnitudes and significantly lessens its severity of you contract it So your already extremely low odds of death from the virus are now even more extremely remote There is no level other than zero that will satisfy Dr Fauci and the fear mongers because they know there is a decent chance this pandemic will be endemic and the virus will not go away Does that justify permanent suspension of liberty for the rest of our lives with the government telling you where you can go and what you have to do and wear on public? We lived with smallpox a far more deadly virus for a very long time and it was one of the few infectious diseases we were able to eradicate completely with vaccines Yet we did not shut our societies down and isolate everyone during the process People died from smallpox Lots of them That is the nature of life The whole thing is pathetic And its especially sad when highly educated doctors tell people they need a vaccine after recently recovering from covid (they dont) and that we need to keep wearing masks despite having immunity (we dont) Its obvious there is something else going on If you want to wear a mask in the community nobody is stopping you By voluntarily wearing a mask you are basically saying that you disagree that this virus has any significant aersolized component (it does) as the aerosol cannot be contained by non n95 masks So if its droplet only then just stay a few feet away from people without masks on if you are going to be around them for more than a few minutes Problem solved Or just get the vaccine and live your life normally without ever worrying about masks or distancing again Once you get the vaccine the pandemic is essentially over for you Period So stop,RangeOrnery,16190450240,-20

gw9aymb,n0jxcp,The Story of Taylor Swift by u/spilledcomputerguts Born on December 13th 1989 in Reading Pennsylvania Swift grew up on a christmas tree farm until she was 12 At 12 the Swift family packed up and moved to Nashville so Taylor could pursue her dreams in music Her first "in" with a label was with RCA except it was a "development deal"  which is "we like you kind of" and they wouldnt let her record her own songs So she did what you dont normally do when you have an in at a label she walked out Later on she was performing a showcase at the Bluebird Cafe in Nashville Ironically the same place where Faith Hill got discovered And a man named Scott Borchetta walked up to her and said "youre good I want you on my label heres my info call me" So she called him He said "Good news and bad news Taylor Good - I want you on my label Bad - I dont have a label Yet Will you wait for me?" She waited In 2006 Big Machine Records was formed with Swift being the first artist signed Her debut album fuelled by singles like "Tim McGraw" "Our Song" and "Picture To Burn" proved successful and her follow up 2008s Fearless made her the youngest woman to win Album of the Year at the Grammys And in 2009 she won the MTV VMA for video of the year for "You Belong With Me" when Kanye West infamously interrupted her prompting swift condemnation (pun intended) and even President Obama called West a "jackass" Taylor was accused of "not pulling her weight" in writing sessions so her third album "Speak Now" was ENTIRELY self written zero co-writers Fun fact: Taylor is credited as writer on EVERY song she has ever released and her co-writers have stated she comes in with finished lyrics and theyre more like editors to trim so the song isnt 10 minutes long "Speak Now" wasnt the original album name Swift had chosen "Enchanted" as the title track and Borchetta made her change it because it sounded "too much like high school and fairytales" Borchetta is also a r@t and well cover that when we get to the 2019 sale of Big Machine Now moving on to RED This was a departure from her previous work with the lead single "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" which SMASHED records and catapulted Swift from "country singer" to certified pop star Swift embarked on the massively successful Red Tour which is her only tour to not have an accompanying live concert album/movie as the director was accused of sexual misconduct and Swift didnt want her name associated with him The Red era also brought significant criticisms regarding Swifts personal life even though she dated "the normal amount for a 22 year old" This was caused by her publicist at the time spreading rumours to sleazy tabloids In 2013 while Swift was on the Red Tour she was groped in a meet and greet by a Colorado radio DJ More on that when we get to the trial in 2017 And when she lost the Album of the Year grammy in 2013 she went back to the drawing board and created "1989"  which catapulted her even FURTHER into stardom when it released in October 2014 At the 2015 Grammys she became the first woman to win AOTY twice Around the Grammys in 2015 Kanye West released a song "Famous" which includes the lines "I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex/Why? I made that b**** famous"  referring to the VMAs incident from 2009 West claimed he had Swifts blessing Swift and her new publicist Tree Paine denied this Wests wife Kim Kardashian leaked an illegally recorded video of a phone call between West and Swift where Swift appears to be mildly comfortable with the sex line but the use of the term "that b****" was never mentioned Swift released a widely-mocked Notes app statement saying "I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative one which I have never asked to be a part of since 2009" Full video of the call leaked years later further proves that Swift told the truth In July 2016 Kardashian tweeted "Wait its legit national snake day? They have holidays for everyone  i mean everything  these days!" (a thinly veiled jab at Swift) followed by a bunch of snake emojis Wests fans then attacked Swift on social media flooding her comments with snake emojis The hashtag #TaylorSwiftIsOverParty was trending #1 worldwide for days In Swifts words "do you know how many people have to hate you in order for that to trend for that long?" Swift disappeared for over a year Retreating from the public eye lead to the creation of 2017s "reputation" which kicked off with the lead single "Look What You Made Me Do" and the record breaking "reputation Stadium Tour" followed in 2018 Before continuing lets circle back to the sexual assault trial Swift was groped by Denver radio DJ David Mueller in 2013 and there is photographic evidence of him reaching up her skirt and latching onto her bottom Swift reported this to his boss he was fired He then sued Swift for millions of dollars Swift filed a countersuit for a symbolic $1 claiming sexual assault and battery The jury sided with Swift In 2018 Swift also broke her longstanding political silence and endorsed two Democratic candidates in the midterm elections while encouraging fans to vote She has continued her activism and political outspokenness to this day Swift left Big Machine Records following the reputation Stadium Tour signing a 7 album deal with Republic Records Prior to the release of Lover news broke that music manager Scooter Braun had purchased Big Machine The value of BMR was increased as they own Taylors first six albums  Swift does not own her own work from 2006 to 2017 which is shocking Artists should always own their work Braun managed Kanye West and Justin Bieber and used Biebers social media to attack Swift In Swifts words: "I learned about Scooter Brauns purchase of my masters as it was announced to the world All I could think about was the incessant manipulative bullying Ive received at his hands for years Like when Kim Kardashian orchestrated an illegally recorded snippet of a phone call to be leaked and then Scooter got his two clients together to bully me online about it [] Now Scooter has stripped me of my lifes work that I wasnt given an opportunity to buy Essentially my musical legacy is about to lie in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it This is my worst case scenario [] Any time Scott Borchetta has heard the words Scooter Braun escape my lips it was when I was either crying or trying not to He knew what he was doing; they both did Controlling a woman who didnt want to be associated with them In perpetuity That means forever" Lover was released shortly after and is the first album that Swift owns entirely In November 2019 Big Machine attempted to block Swift from performing a mashup of her biggest hits at an award show and using past concert footage in a documentary as they claimed it would be violating the re-recording clause of her agreement She is legally allowed to begin re-recording her previous work (so that she owns at least a version of her past work) starting in November 2020 and has stated she intends to do so Borchetta and Braun told her that either she shuts up about what theyre doing to her or they wont let her play her music So she made a public plea for us (her fans) to help her knowing we would go to war for her And go to war we did She did the medley The footage was used in the documentary And she still intends to re-record her lifes work that they stole Fast forward to 2020 The global pandemic caused the cancellation of all her live performances this year Isolation proved to be a creative boon for Swift as she wrote her next album within months Last Thursday she marked a new first The first time she ever did a surprise drop Swift announced the album "folklore" on Thursday July 23 and told the world it would be out at midnight "folklore" has broken countless records in its first week shattering her own sales records "folklore" sold 13 MILLION units worldwide in its first 24 hours (pure sales like they dont even happen anymore in the streaming era but they do for Swift) The album and its lead single "cardigan" have broken numerous streaming records In December 2020 Swift followed "folklore" up with a surprise drop of its sister album "evermore" which went on to break even more records In February 2021 Swift announced the first of her six re-recorded albums would be out April 9th "Fearless (Taylors Version)" includes all 19 original Fearless tracks plus "Today Was A Fairytale" and six never-before-heard tracks from the Fearless vault The vault tracks topped the iTunes chart By topping her previous works with each new release and even with re-recordings of 13-year-old songs Swift has proven time and again that she is a master of reinventing herself while staying true to herself and her loyal fanbase As Barbara Walters said in a 2014 interview "Taylor Swift is the music industry",SpilledComputerGuts,16196684720,2

gw7irv3,n0jxcp,> No no no no no hear me out So this was at the beginning of Batmans career right so hes fighting the Joker the first appearance hes made since falling into the Ace Chemicals vat but Supermans been around for a while in this continuity So Batman gets shot and because hes inexperienced hes not able to protect himself properly ends with him being paralysed has to be in a wheelchair Unfortunately no amount of money is ever going to be able to heal him so he decides he has to give up being the Batman Lois Lane comes over from Metropolis to interview him about it but because Alfred went in to pick him up before the police arrived nobody knows hes Batman yet Jimmy Olsen goes around Wayne Manor since its going to be a televised interview so hes looking for a good place to put the shot Alfred steps out to assist Bruce and in the meantime Olsen gets free reign of the Wayne Manor Drawing Room You know where this is going He plays some random notes on the piano as hes dicking about and suddenly the grandfather clock swings open and he finds a passage down into the Batcave > Alfred comes back tells him to keep it a secret and to return to the Manor that night so that they can explain themselves It takes a bit of convincing but he does show up because you know Batman Hes explained the situation and told that if he wants to release the story he can they just want a little bit more time to prepare to tell the public about it knowing that with Bruce Waynes injury and Batmans disappearance coinciding it wont take long for people to connect the dots So Jimmy walks home feeling a bit sad about the whole situation and then he gets abducted because hes a nerd with a camera walking alone at night in Gotham Hey thats kinda like whats happening now! Anyway so he was kidnapped by Dr Kirk Langstrom which should be a familiar name if you know anything about Batman and he tests a very early prototype of the Man-Bat formula on Jimmy at a time where the formula is still in development Jimmy uses his signal watch he was given by Superman to call for help and sure enough the Man of Steel charges in and saves the day > Now theres one thing you have to know about Jimmy Olsen; he often gets transformed into different things So for DC logic hes likely got a metagene that means hes capable of adapting to genetic modification better So yeah Langstrom fucking dies because he thinks the formula used on Jimmy was stable when it wasnt Jimmy returns to Metropolis keeping Bruce Waynes secret from everyone Over the next week he starts getting stronger and faster and he develops super sonic hearing his reflexes get better he basically becomes Daredevil if Daredevil could see and was a photographer who was an aspiring journalist He gets a call from Bruce Wayne asking to see him as Langstrom was an employee of Waynetech before he went rogue and when he visits Wayne Manor the Bat-Signal flares up Jimmy stares at it for a moment noticing Bruces discontentment with being unable to do anything and he excuses himself for the bathroom but actually runs down to the Batcave to put on a Batsuit and steal the Batmobile > After an awkward conversation with Gordon on top of the GCPD building he rushes over to the hostage situation at the Gotham Gazette He finds out Victor Zsasz is up to his old serial killer tricks again having locked everyone inside and he has to be discrete about how he takes down Zsasz which is not something Jimmys been trained for Bruce however having noticed Jimmys obvious absence directs him in taking down the maniac and while many died and many more were traumatised Jimmy Olsen Batman saved the day But he gets scolded by Wayne and told never to do something as reckless as that again although Alfred thanks him on both of their behalves shortly afterward After he returns once again to Metropolis he keeps reading news from over in Gotham and finds that too much is happening there for him to be able to stay away He applies for a job at the Gazette and sees Superman off at the airport having been informed at some point by Bruce that hes actually Clark Kent He gets the job as a reporter gets approval from Bruce to be a new Batman and the rest is history > So yeah it turns out Jimmy Olsen Batman ends up being a way better Batman than Bruce could ever have been Hes not a billionaire he spent a long time as collateral damage of a superheros fights so he values civilians a lot more and the separation of Bruce Wayne and Batman allow Bruce to be a much better parent to Dick Grayson who still becomes Robin but never loses his respect in either his adoptive father or the Batman Jason Todd gets sent to live in an orphanage in Fawcett City where he becomes a member of the family Shazam Joker never quite gets cured but over time the difference Jimmy makes actually does change him some and he gains moments of clarity enough even to share wisdom with a young Tim Drake about his time as the Red Hood prompting Tim to become the new Red Hood and then it turns out that actually Talia Al Ghul slid into Jimmy Olsens tinder DMs in a real Superman comic so if hes Batman of course theyre going to bone She might not have meant to have a kid with him but I mean the kid would have superpowers And Damian does he gets enormous Bat-wings even and becomes a young Nightwing named after a story Superman once told Jimmy about the heroes of Krypton Lots of stuff changes but mainly Gotham changes as Jimmy Olsens impact as Batman is just far far better than any other versions has been Because he treats his villains with compassion and of course as the Editor for the Gazette he ensures the town is keeping a lot more honest than it used to > Wait why are you kicking me out you havent heard my pitch for a Victor Zsasz fights the Question movie spinoff!,Gate4043,16196381130,1

In school suspension So to be clear the penalty for having a damaged ID was to be pulled out of a class youre currently attending and thrown in the basement where youre literally not allowed to do school work Of course if you got sent to ISS you would spend the rest of the day either plotting to or successfully ditching school because even if you went back to class the roster would have a note that you were supposed to be in ISS and your teacher would be forced to send you back down The next day (of course they didnt allow you to do this when you got caught as that would enable you to just keep going to class) you would have to go to the office pay $20 wait 15 minutes (missing more class) and get your new ID But what about the kids that literally couldnt afford new IDs you ask? Well fuck them Theyre stuck in ISS indefinitely and ISS counts as missed attendance for your class Most of you can probably put two and two together to figure out what the kids that couldnt pay did For the rest of you my freshman class had roughly 1100 students we graduated 311 and we had the highest retention rate since integration,CottonSC,16212726790,3

gyic4h9,nehqa9,Segregation based on curriculum and extracurricular activities For roughly 5-7 years the public schools in our town thought it would be wise to divide up students in each grade based on their curriculum and extracurricular activities For instance my 8th grade year our class was roughly split up into three "teams": "Red Dragons" was comprised of primarily jocks "Blue Eagles" was for band students and "Purple Panthers" was for honor roll students + problematic students (which we were told was admins idea of honor roll students being a good influence on students that were constantly being disciplined) There were a few other factors in consideration but those appeared to be the common threads unifying each team Each team had their own separate teachers hallways lunch times etc We also wore ID badges with lanyards that matched the color of our team (in addition to our uniform policy and strict dress code which was a huge disaster on its own considering the fact that nearly everyone in our town was below the poverty line) Mind you the town I grew up in is in the rural south and our demographics were roughly speaking 80% black 12% white and 8% everyone else I didnt observe any one team having a notable racial disparity so I genuinely dont believe that admin had any ulterior racial agenda that they were pushing We did have incredibly high teen pregnancy drug use/distribution and gang violence rates (and so on and so on) though and I think in some fucked up way they thought this idea could bring those numbers down When the "Teams" system was implemented it essentially created school-sanctioned gangs Kids would literally unite under their team name and would get into conflicts with other students if they were wandering down the wrong team hallway Or if you had friends with someone that was on a different team than your own it was almost like that friend was no longer at the same school as you You would literally never see them unless you broke team rules and went down a hallway that you werent supposed to be in They discontinued this policy after so many years Edit: Oh yeah and we also got rubber bands banned because we had an epidemic where kids would not stop shooting staple-ridden paper footballs at each other And we had the option of getting water or unsweet tea for lunch (versus milk) taken away from us because our principal got crowned with a styrofoam cup Crowned meaning that someone placed an empty styrofoam cup on the top of his bald head and smashed it so it made a loud POP He later got a beer bottle broken over his head during a school riot,PassTheBallToTucker,16212958710,4

This went on for about 20 min Until one of the students said "you said we could put anything and there where no wrong answers" I also realized that And said she shouldnt be allowed to do this Because A she cant force a student to loose his or her faith And B its just wrong We where kids Most of us where open to both She sent me and the other student outside And we where not allowed to attend class for the rest of the day Our reasons for being sent out are actually on paper as a disagreement with the teacher Because some student had a different opinion than her,sonofloki1,16212704340,8

gyhwvx5,nehqa9,Rule: No unnatural hair color (extensions could be whatever color but your actual hair cant be an "unnatural" color) Parents let me dye my hair pink and purple (8th grade) and I was suspended the next day This was a public junior high in California Bay Area and my father was pissed When he got called in to pick me up he let my vice principle know that he doesnt believe her hair naturally doesnt have any grays We left the office with me being suspended until I "fixed" my hair and my dad yelling how stupid this rule is I love my dad,badwolfbay10,16212884810,2
gyhy9df,nehqa9,Sooo many (mostly clothing related) - for context - I went to a very old private girls school - 13 years K-12 - if your hair was shoulder length or more it needed to be tied up with the school coloured ribbon (a very particular shade) If you didnt have one or the color was off down you went to the uniform shop to purchase a ribbon - couldnt wear gym clothes out on the street In your normal uniform you also couldnt wear the school sweater on the street it always had to be worn in conjunction with the school blazer or school coat as the sweater was deemed too "form fitting" to be worn in public - our dresses had to be a particular length - I remember kneeling in a row in home room every Monday with the nuns and a ruler - no make up or jewelry (they made an exception for religious jewelry) There would be a teacher at the gates at hometime to make sure we were all presentable as we left - best behaviour at all times in the school uniform This extended to not being allowed in the local shops eating in public in your uniform or talking to boys There were nuns waiting down at the local train station at hometimes again to scold you if they saw you in a shop or to come pull you away if you were seen "consulting with the opposite sex",wufflebunny,16212891040,2
gyhzgfd,nehqa9,Dress code on middle school girls I mostly wore my mothers handmedowns and Im proportioned differently from her so the shirts were almost always a bit short on me The administration would regularly go around telling all the girls to put our hands up so they could check if it showed any skin and then yell at us if it showed even a sliver I started pulling my pants up as far as possible to avoid getting publicly scolded for being poor The *one* time I had new clothes was for picture day It was a dress my mom made an extra she made in secret because her job was making clothes and her current production happened to be these nice elegant dresses with a shawl She didnt finish the shawl in time (she was making a special one just for me) so she sent me to school with just the dress which showed my shoulders I was pulled into the hallway for "distracting the boys" and made to take my yearbook photo in my gym strip On the one day were *supposed* to be showy,Shryxer,16212896640,2

No-one Except the one or two people who were already wearing them No-one got detention and they never ever mentioned the ties ever again I just love how all the girls of the school just silently banded together to tell the administration to go fuck themselves because there was no way in hell they were getting Australian public school students to wear those stupid things,WorldWithoutWheel,16213028400,2
gyir7pv,nehqa9,Lets see Seventh-Day Adventist boarding school in the early 80s- (we lived on the campus in dormitories) &#x200B; 1 No radios or other music producing devices because popular music was demonic Oh and if you played Stairway backwards it summoned the devil! Getting caught was a $25 fine and you wouldnt get your tape back Theyd give the radio/walkman to your parents when they came to get you during a vacation break (roughly every month and a half) 2 No meat or caffeinated drinks including soda -- it was against the health message (They did have for the most part great vegetarian food served at the campus cafeteria) When they bused us into town every couple weeks to hang out at the mall everybody beelined for the burger joint for a juicy one and a Coke! 3 No public displays of affection even casual hand holding - getting caught put you on what was called "social" meaning you couldnt have contact with your love interest for two weeks 4 No co-ed hiking in the hills surrounding the campus Guys had to hike in one direction and girls in the other 5 You could hold hands during one event: skate night in the gym The story goes that back in the first half of the 20th century Adventist schools actually made kids hold a wooden stick between them while skating so they wouldnt touch hands And of course music played for skating was the old organ music - no devils pop music ever! 6 Study hall enforced every evening from 7:00-9:00 you had to stay in your room and stay quiet You could get permission to go study with a friend or to go to the bathroom 7 Lights out at 9:00 If anyone had their light on after that they could be punished by either forced running laps or "free labor" which was shoveling crap at the dairy farm for you guessed it no pay 8 No "questionable" dress including blue jeans Some of the stricter faculty had rulers to measure skirt/dress length! 9 Mandatory attendance for ALL religious functions including three church services on Saturday another on Friday night and worship every morning and evening during the week The only saving grace was Saturday morning breakfast when they served the gushiest sweet rolls imaginable It put everyone in a sugar stupor before going to church 10 No dancing (all semi-formal social events were called "banquets") The list goes on it was a nutty place I did have some good times though and always had a secret radio or tape player because music was the only way one could stay sane!,DesertTripper,16213034240,2

h1ao65h,nwpf1a,I was just over 11 pounds at birth and got stuck mid breach Head out shoulders wouldnt push through Doctor(s) decided that cutting me out would take too long at this point and could kill us both so they pulled me out In doing so they tore all the "wiring" as it were down my left side of my neck Unbeknownst to them What happened was stunded growth of my left arm at an angle pointing almost behind me They had to operate on my shoulder socket and my hand had gone full on T-rex angled so they broke my wrist and turned it to force it to grow normally I was in an almost 3/4 torso cast for months as a small kid Today in my mid 30s I cant fully outstretch my left arm maybe a 2/3rd stretch at best I cant lift it higher than my mid chest my wrist is pretty loose (hey now) so my hand wants to naturally flop forward a lot I can still move around mostly but I cant push with my left arm all that much struggle lifting heavy things cant push away to the side of me cant drive manual cars but can drive autos My arm is also thinner than my right Due to the muscle development I had a twitch in a thumb almost like a clock for about 4 years that suddenly stopped Also have to use my right hand to get my left in to the position I want it to be in because the nerves arent there to send the signal to move it in certain directions You normally just move your arms but I cant and its like trying to move a part of you through telepathy Physio was the only answer but it barely changed anything after circa 6 months and I packed that in in my early teens because whats the point etc Its fucked me up pretty badly mentally Id say even though Im overall pretty happy Doesnt affect my work I can still type etc but I get aches on my left shoulder blade and shoulder I cant do pushups or pullups so dont go to the gym or do sports as its an obvious disadvantage so Im overweight but not massive I naturally got bullied at school a HELL of a lot Im so used to hiding it that its muscle memory now even though Im at the stage of my life where I can say "eh yeah this is me deal with it" But because I dont work out I stopped swimming or doing anything with my shirt off in public Id say yeah pretty damn rare case And I dont even know what the condition is called I need to see a doctor about it as this was 80s when I was born and medicine has changed so much Im just so used to being this way Ive never really pushed to get answers Ive thought about it more since the pandemic but obviously doctors arent exactly seeing people right now for non-emergency stuff ---------------------------------------------------- [Edit] Oh wow my inbox exploded overnight Thanks so much everyone for the support rewards and helping me see that this isnt actually all that uncommon I just have a case where it wasnt fixed in time or more to the point was a direct result of being pulled out and it didnt develop while I was in the womb like some palsy can do Yes Ive thought of suing over the years My parents thought the same but this is the UK and the NHS - my cousin was a nurse at the time and suggested against anything in court because back then the doctors would band together against us saying it was the right call to be made at the time and circumstances and that Im an accident and just had bad luck I havent contacted any lawyers about it ever but some days I wonder if I should given the sheer impact on my life physically and mentally due to a "bad call" by a doctor I also acknowledge that some of you have pointed out in DMs and reponses that people have lost limbs and still go to the gym and are ripped whats my excuse Ive been making excuses and hiding my arm as best I can and 99% of the time it goes unrecognized as I still have everyday control over it and it at least looks SOMEWHAT normal if maybe half or 3/4 the size and width of my right arm A lot of keeping my hand in my pockets When youve spent 34 years hiding something and having it control you so much its hard to mentally just say "fuck it" and go to the gym and not care what anyone thinks People see things differently - if you lost a limb people will be proud of you for going to the gym and understand When you have a limb that isnt normal but looks almost normal you get ridiculed bullied as a kid and teenager and even adults will stare and judge you You dont forget that stuff and it messes with your head and its just "easier" to not show it by going to the gym I dunno maybe thats not the case and everyone in a gym is like "fuck yeah man get it" if they saw me trying But I can barely do curls normally and struggle with any bar lifting as my wrist doesnt rotate as much as my right so maintaining a grip can be a bit awkward Which confuses people because my hand looks normal I cant do bench presses cant do pullups cant do pushups The strength isnt there nor are the nerves to actually push my arm away from me You know when you lift so much you literally cant move your arm? Imagine that but it happens after a certain point of movement I can move my arm to X position but past that its LITERALLY impossible as the muscle development and nerves to send the signal are literally not there Its just that when its not obvious you either have to tell people straight up or make an excuse Everything from being scanned at an airport long-sleeve clothing is slightly too long on my left arm but normal length on my right being asked to grab that thing off the top shelf as Im 63 so I have to reach up and grab the thing with my right arm lower it with my shoulder and then grab it with my left as it comes down and looks like Im gonna drop it People dont understand Getting scanned in a T shape- "Sir as I asked can you put your left arm out please?" "I cant" "Ohuhhhwhy not?" *sigh* and it makes me emotional on the spot I dunno maybe its all excuses and I need therapy but seeing a consultant for my options will be a start Maybe surgery can help I dont know Ive lived so long with it that it feels weird doing something about it for once instead of hiding it every time I head out the door - I literally pick clothing that makes it easier to hide my arm Pockets long sleeves I love jackets of course I hate summer as its shorts and tshirts and it makes it more "obvious" to me,Dynasty2201,16233420630,8859

gzxwv95,nns8ge,Acid Man on Public Transit Minneapolis MN It was the night of July 4th 2013 Then 18 year old petite high-fem female Important details for later: I made a good female friend that night who said that I looked like I couldve been 15 if it wasnt for my curves I had fair skin bleached blonde mid-length curly hair light grey eyes & a very sweet & innocent look I had just moved to the city from the Rez for college A friend back home encouraged me to go enjoy the fireworks & see if I make any new friends (despite struggling with agoraphobia social fear & panic) Very much not fun was had It was a lame fireworks performance with big crowds constant cigarettes & groups of drunk or rude people all surrounded by cars & exhaust The cover band sucked Leaving was a certain hell already because the exits were dead packed with almost no movement It took maybe 5 minutes to get up maybe 7 stairs (Trying not to exaggerate but I really think thats correct) Ended up getting terribly lost once getting away from the bridge & even though I had a phone I didnt have a service provider I was relying on public wifi (which was not as available as it is now) Maybe 10 or 15 minutes after either midnight or 1AM I finally find the right bus My first time sitting in the back of the bus Im alone in front of a relaxed & joking white guy with wild frizzy curly dark hair I remember that he was sitting alone & had a backpack but thats all I remember He was making friendly humorous talk with me as I was sitting down I mentioned being lost but didnt get specific guess thats all he needed He offered me acid right away & that weirded me out so I immediately & clearly said "no" a few times & ignored him I was finally able to call my friend (using the transit wifi) & tell her that I was on the bus Once I hang up I hear & feel that man lean into my hair & right ear (I was already leaning on the window) He very clearly but softly said : "you look just like a girl that I gang raped with a few bikers" I was horrified & was already panicking before he finished that first sentence He continued detailing his experience but I missed everything valuable for the police to investigate Mightve heard him say it was a year earlier & was maybe in a different state? With what mustve been a face of pale terror I locked eyes with a very petite Chinese girl directly across the isle from me (I didnt realize) she was paying attention to my situation She VERY quickly rang the exit bell & pushed past the man to tightly grab my arm & force me to stand & run off with her I was already crying before we got past the bus rear exit doors Sweet girl but I remember that she kind of aggressively asked if I was OK & safe She mentioned that she thought the man & I were friends because we were laughing when she first got on the bus but she knew something was wrong when I loudly said "no" to him On a later date she told me that my face made her react without really thinking She is so strong & smart (Love you Yang! I hope your life is beautiful in all the ways) So I slept on her couch that night & she took me to valley fair with her friends the next day (to "make sure I didnt get traumatized"?) I ended up making a great friend that horrible night (Sorry for any mistakes or poor grammar) TLDR: July 4th very late Got on the bus & a guy told me that he gang raped a girl that looked like me,forasadboy,16223466560,3

gzx0jsw,nns8ge,Wow do I have one of these in my life So in high school my best friend (who was a few years older than me) moved out of his parents home and got his own apartment I of course helped with the move in and that is where I met Noelle (not her real name but its what she insisted everyone call her so lets do it) Noelle was the pinnacle of a meth head if they had meth head awards she would be hosting to steal all of the trophies to hock them for more meth Noelle was one of his 2 roommates for close to two years During the move in the first time I had ever even heard of this person she decided to tell me her entire life story or at least what she could remember of it at any given point in time Below is an incomplete and mostly in order list of every bit of information I was given/weird shit she did within 3 hours of us being made aware of each other: (tw:mentions of horrible shit and r*pe) (will definitely be long but Ive been told before that hearing this crazy shit is worth it) -she explained to me *how* her meth addiction started yes right off the bat she was admitting to the meth -the explanation that became drastically more terrifying as the 3 hours went on and more of the story came out? Her half brother had been r*ping her for years and when she finally got the courage to tell someone he had told all of her friends a week prior that she was paying him to have sex with her so not only did the entire town turn against her she got kicked out of home because her parents believed him -informed me that she could do any art commission I needed at a deeply discounted price Her portfolio? 5 canvases of a generic naked alien lady and 3 pieces of dry wall that were badly cut from what I assumed was once a nursery wall depicting animal hybrids (one was a frog hawk) -when I had turned to ask my friend to hand me a screwdriver so I could finish setting up their entertainment center by the time I looked back at her she had a banjo The banjo was not in the room I didnt even see a guitar case in the apartment She didnt move from her spot The banjo just appeared in her hands and she was strumming it and singing folk songs I still have absolutely no fucking clue where the banjo came from -I watched her head butt my best friend and their other roommate a dozen times each And it was not a "love boop" like cats do or anything she was full on swinging her head back and slamming it into their chests because it was fun? I have no clue but my best friend basically had a permanent bruise across his chest for the entire time she lived with them -at one point she collected her two cats held one under each arm stood on the back of the couch and began *grooming* them with her own tongue This was accompanied by the occasion "meow" from her that was so convincing I didnt realize she was the one making the noises for a solid 5 minutes -once we were done setting up the living room her boyfriend appeared And I quite literally mean appeared I never heard the front door open or saw anyone new come into the apartment I was stocking the fridge and when I looked up meth jesus was just standing in the living room asking me what species of apple was in the bowl (Macintosh -_-) -speaking of meth jesus he *also* introduced himself to me with the information that he was a meth head Meth jesus and Noelle then launched into a tirade of explaining to me how to tell the difference between regular and psychedelic mushrooms that r naturally growing -after we had finished everything up we decided to watch a movie My best friend the third roommate and myself all wanted to watch Hairspray at my recommendation because the third roommate had told me he had never seen it when we were setting everything up At meth Jesuss insistence we decided to watch Cars 2 Why? Because it was so funny that they had planes and buses when I pointed out that I was pretty sure they had planes and buses in the first one but never as a foreground character I was yelled at for 6 minutes straight (I watched the clock) about how ignorant and annoying I was being that is when I decided to just agree with whatever meth heads r saying so I dont get an organ stolen -about 20 minutes into Cars 2 meth jesus and Noelle bailed and went to her room where they proceeded to have very loud and honestly painful sounding sex for the next 2 and a half hours -we immediately switched the move to hairspray and turned it up as loud as possible -after the marathon or possible boxing match was done in noelles room she emerged completely naked and dripping in sweat She and I immediately made direct eye contact she said "oh ur still here" then walked right into the kitchen to grab some mango juice and head back to her room Another 20 minutes later and meth jesus *also* emerged butt ass naked and dripping sweat to which the exact same exchange happened It was at that moment that I realized I could only take so much meth head shenanigans and left There was quite a bit more that happened but this is already humongous so Ill leave it there,RepublicOfLizard,16223271320,1

hahem6h,pbzt5b,Actually starting to take antidepressants when I was depressed I get this one might be a little controversial so Ill try and give some more context to help people Despite my life being pretty together and not suffering from any major tragic events I was nearly always anxious and daily tasks were regular a struggle I didnt even realise this wasnt normal until I went to university and began to notice that other people were just so much more efficient at doing what should be considered "chores" Basically at "living normally" After speaking to my doctor he recommended some talking therapy which helped somewhat but it was always hard to know what to discuss because fundamentally there wasnt much wrong My life was pretty together Of course we hit a few deep things about family etc but nothing groundbreaking and on the whole I dont think it made much difference After about 8 months of this and worrying I wouldnt get better I gave in and asked for medication I literally cannot explain how marked the difference was almost instantly Within a few days I wasnt anxious in public spaces anymore (for the first time I could remember for years) and within a few weeks I began to notice that those chores had become exactly that chores I didnt even really think about doing It was honestly like the clouds had lifted From my simple lay perspective I think people get depression and anxiety for either biological or environmental reasons I would say that antidepressants are 100% worth a try in 2 scenarios 1 The environmental parts of your life are more or less well put together (eg family relationships job etc) and you cant identify a clear trigger for your depression This was my position and because of my response to the meds Im 100% convinced that there was something purely biological wrong with that they addressed 2 The environmental parts arent put together but youre at the end of your rope or suffering so much that you need a little help to get back on your feet If youre depressed or anxious and kind of in the middle of these I would suggest trying to fix some of the environmental things before trying antidepressants Also run run a lot At least 3x a week Id say that running was about 90% as effective as the meds I eventually got at combating my anxiety and depression so always give that a go first,Thod0x,16300170170,2

hamhmx7,pbzt5b,switching to a public school people who have lived in public schools will probably argue and i get why everyone says its shit (which it is) but my old school (which i went to since i was 3 now in highschool) was a small community and barely had any new kids because of how expensive the tuition was (my mom works there so we got a small discount) on top of that legit everyone (except teachers) were toxic as hell and it destroyed my mental health i made one of my best friends at my new school and i dont regret a thing also note on my mom since she worked there for years every teacher knew me (no exaggeration) and on top of it my sister went there till she graduated (older than me) so everyone sometimes called me by her name i do have fond memories of that place (meeting my first girlfriend meeting a few of my closest friends) and it was a part of who i am now but its almost like a stain on my life i mention that i went to a private school and everyone thinks im a rich kid my family isnt living in some mansion but we are pretty well off,eret_the_mushroom,16301097360,2

gxyckfx,nbaar5,It didnt ruin the wedding or marriage but it came close An English guy marrying an Irish girl in Ireland The wedding guests are comprised mostly of her family including family from Northern Ireland (the nationalist republican parts); and his English friends and family The wedding part goes off fine Very romantic Nice ceremony But then at the reception the time comes for speeches Specifically the best man speech The best man is a particularly red-faced brexit-voting English man He proceeds to make the most insensitive offensive speech filled with jokes about recolonizing Ireland one woman at a time; about how the stag party had been a Good Friday but the hangover was so bad it led to a Bloody Sunday You get the idea He winds up the speech by making a comment about how the speeches have gone on so long that its like the guests are on hunger strike Throughout all of this the English groom and his friends and family were laughing They thought it was funny Her Irish family were all fuming I was there as the plus-one of one of the brides cousins It was aggressively awkward and a lot of her cousins and uncles just refused to mingle with the grooms family at all Im no longer in touch with the guy who took me so I dont know how the marriage is going The bride was very kind and despite his best mans speech the groom seemed like a nice enough guy,bleepybleeperson,16208914550,4147
gxynwve,nbaar5,I have a ***George Soros wedding story*** for after my main story Was a caterer at a really expensive wedding overlooking Rockefeller center in during the holiday season Two prominent New York Jewish families being bonded Bride and groom got way too drunk and started physically fighting in front of everyone on the dance floor while screaming in each others faces Like the bride trying to throw punches and the groom shoving her The grooms mother was also pretty blasted and came back into the kitchen to blame us (the kitchen staff) for "ruining her babys big day" because apparently one of the hors doeuvres came out a few minutes too late and this was to blame for them getting too drunk and starting a public fist fight I actually had permission to dip early from that shift and was getting into the elevator right as the groom was screaming obscenities and had to held up/back by multiple members of the wedding party I had to try really hard not to laugh earlier when his mother screamed in my face how we should feel ashamed and how she "wasnt going to pay a penny" (as though hiring a team of 15 back-end chefs 5 up-front-party chefs 2 catering managers and a team of wait-staff was something you can totally pay for after the factafter everyone already ate) I dont know what happened after I left but I was pleased to leave when I did Now for the Liberal boogeyman story I did some of the prep for **George Soros latest wedding** and while it wasnt ruined there were a few mishaps that were hilarious He imported a foreign team of chefs from the top michelin-starred restaurant in Europe They proceeded to get fucking hammered every night in NYC and could barely function the next day (or were at least nursing hangovers and half asleep for the first few hours they were there every morning they were back to normal by the second half the day) This went on for weeks Free vacation from Mr Soros as far as they were concerned I was a lowly kitchen-hand and this bigshot chef was nice to me though so I thought he was rad A lot of chefs are raging assholes and this guy patiently taught me how to break down alaskan king crab when i admitted I had no experience with such a task*Stealth edit: you would be surprised how many chefs function while drunk on the job as a regular modus operandi We had a few chefs who got sent home and were well into the 6-figure mark a few times while i was there Like work all day drink all night not go home and come back to the kitchen at 6:30am and pass out in their offices The europeans didnt do this they at least went home to their hotels before strolling in the next day Alcoholism and other forms of drug abuse are real issues in that industry* Soros wanted all the herbs to be fresh so he actually had us buy an entire room full of potted herbs and edible plants that I had to rotate and water for weeks leading up the wedding None of that made it to the wedding despite the plants being in good condition We gave them away to staff after the wedding The funniest bit was that one of the main dishes were imported lobster tail (that i personally had to help prep for hours on end) and the staff FORGOT to cook it so at the last minute the chef (the imported big-shot who was hungover) decided that it was going to be served raw and he was just going to play it off like it was his intention all along Soros apparently complimented him on how he had never heard of that before but that it was great and this guy was a culinary genius or some shit &#x200B; The weddings of the super rich are incredible wasteful There was a team well north of 100 people for just one of the nights of the Soros bash and that was just from our company and thats NOT including all the people who actually prepped the food BEFORE the day of the wedding (people like me who spent literally 8 hours just breaking up alaskan king crab with a cleaver while standing in a freezer) *edit 2: to all of those who are saying "yeah right there is no way they forgot to cook the lobster tail" you probably dont understand just how much food was needed to be prepped They had to dedicate an entire walk-in plus other facilities to just the prep for this one wedding Thats usually enough space to hold many weddings/functions worth of food Imagine a large bedroom just filled literally to the ceiling with meat and veggies (it actually wasnt just one walk-in it was different sections of multiple walk-ins but the space added up to be at least one full walk-in)* *Even with a team of dozens of cooks it can be hard to get everything out in time even for a regular large wedding never mind a billionaires wedding Were not talking about "oh i forgot to heat up a platter of XYZ with the sternos" were talking about 100+ plates of something Even setting that up to be cooked is going to take some time nevermind plating it and getting it ready AT THE SAME TIME as the other stuff its supposed to come out with Think of how many people fail at their regular thanksgiving dinner trying to get everything ready at the same time Now imagine that you are managing a team of 100+ people and there is a fairly strict time window for each course and dozens of things to prepare Even for a veteran head chef this is not a walk in the park* Edit 3: To be clear I dont think the executive chef did a bad job or was overly flippant with his responsibilities Managing a wedding that large is an insane task and he honestly did a great job He was calm polite and even though he was commanding a totally foreign staff of far less skilled people than himself he managed to impress his billionaire client I dont blame him and his staff for living it up a little during their time in NYC I hope they had a good time and hit a big lick,The_Swoley_Ghost,16209020440,2335

gyjxqut,nbaar5,My best friend (bride) selected her old roommate as a bridesmaid even though she was known for being extremely moody mean and narcissistic This bridesmaid insisted she make all 300 wedding invites by hand (because she was an avid scrap-booker) The bride agreed because she thought shed save money She didnt Everything this bridesmaid purchased was way over budget and difficult to source She couldnt make all the invites by hand on time as they were far too detailed She guilt tripped all the bridesmaids into making the invites with her which took days and shifts of volunteers She was horribly rude She tried to take over every event planned for the bride even though her sister and I outranked her in the bridal party and had it handled She made myself and the other bridesmaids want fo quit several times The bride ( I love her but) was extremely unorganised late to everything due to her total lack of time management and insisted on handing out tons of jobs in the week leading up to the wedding that should have been done well in advance to that It felt hard to breathe from the stress of it Even her 200 person seating chart wasnt done until 2am the night before the wedding Her friend from the church told her she changed her mind about how much she would charge for the dresses she was making all of us I think she tripled the cost Very last minute in terms of wedding planning So she gave that girl the boot Then she was having our dresses made by the Grooms aunt None of them fit right and we were having last minute fittings up until the day before the wedding The aunt turned up the morning of the wedding with the brides altered dress and it did not fit The bride was crying And it was not the finished look they had agreed on It ended up being a pretty boring gown And we were all trying to offer a solution while watching the start time of the wedding come and go on the clock We were an hour late to her wedding The guests were not amused You could feel the tension The service was one where the pastors goal was to convert any non-Christians and waffled on and on Boring Bible bashing The bride tried to save on photography by having her own aunt do the photos because she loved her aunts amateur wildlife photography Turns out photographing people was much harder for than she cared to admit and my friend still regrets her photos even 16 years later She cried when she got them back They were awful and the aunt had forgotten to take pictures of key family members too I gave my speech to the bride at the reception and had everyone in laughing when I finished by saying "Laura Im jealous that you will be having sex tonight and I wont" I knew the couple had waited until their wedding night to consummate and that my audience would be conservative Christian so they would be extraordinarily shocked and love it I could see my mother in the large crowd of tables stand up and take off to the bathroom My young sister informed me that mum was so embarrassed by me I found mum in the loo and she said "I am so embarrassed to call you my daughter right now I cant believe you would say that in front of 200 guests You know better" I laughed it off The wedding reception ended early when a guest had a seizure on the dance floor and had to be taken away by ambulance He was a known epileptic in the bridess church and he knew the consequences of being around flashing disco lights but he selfishly did it any way The bride was so upset as dancing is one of her favourite things in the world and what she and the groom were looking forward to most When it came to my own wedding a few months later we had a bit of a drive to an old country church I was on time because I learned a lot from her wedding But suddenly the car carrying the bridesmaids pulled over and so we followed When one of the bridesmaids came up to my car and told me she was told by my maid of honour (Laura) to stop the cars so we could be a little late so all the guests had time to take a seat I was more than annoyed I had already factored that into my time No way she was going to make me late to my wedding like she was to hers,Public-Shoulder-5552,16213343580,11

gy0nn4z,nbaar5,We called this the "wedding of the century" at work as a coworker had invited about 20 of us to the ceremony One of those invited was a lady who was a bit of a trainwreck having been recently divorced and who had an ongoing and accidentally public affair with a supervisor We will call her "Helen" Starts out well and good enough with the only memorable part of the actual ceremony being that the priest said I now present mr And mrs Brides-maiden-name So all the coworkers got a good laugh and thought that would be the end Fast forward to the reception which had an open bar Soon I to the festivities Helen is noticed to have 2 handfuls of shots she is carrying to the table; so everyone knows the afternoon/evening has some potential Soon after the meal Helen is sitting on a chair with another coworkers female date and theres no question the two ladies were attracted to each other as some pretty graphic making out is happening Some of this remains unnoticed due to the dancing but most of the coworkers are all definitely interested that table I personally enjoyed watching peoples faces contort through all the emotions from surprised to shock and then to horror as all this is playing out Following dessert the (5-yr-old) daughter of the bride was in the ladies restroom with grandma when it is very apparent that there are 2 women having sex in the stall So then a coworkers wife and the date of another coworkers date go in to detrail this train This is all to no avail and eventually the bride is made aware and goes into the bathroom to forcibly request the 2 parties involved to leave immediately which they drunkenly did Following was an evening involving a hunting bow a failed 3some and a harrowing rescue but I didnt witness any of that,Kenthrax,16209358930,3

h6006ow,oop94z,Most people dont make a big spectacle of themselves crying in public unless theyre looking for attention And *all* of social media is looking for attention so that goes 1000 times more there Obviously there are going to be times when something horrible happens in public which makes you cry on the spot and of course thats fineBut if you go out of your way to make a scene out of proportion to the drama its a ploy for attention,notagoodboye,16268735980,3523

h60l8me,oop94z,Seeing lots of "they need attention" answers and I dont think they are wrong just that there is an opportunity for more in the conversation I absolutely have had people in my feed that I unfollowed bc the crying for attention was absolutely present and unhealthy On the other hand I have a handful of videos that stick out to me as healthy expressions of vulnerability and honesty that are coming from a good place Example: a friend of my husband? whos father had passed a year earlier posted a video talking about his grief that day He opened with "Im going to cry during this and thats ok There are going to be people in my comments who are going to say this is pussy-shit and I dont care Men need to be allowed to feel what they are feeling" He then went on to say wonderful things about his memories with his dad and shed many tears along the way He ended with a message encouraging people to show love at any and every opportunity you can If you love someone- tell them show them do anything you can to be present with them And allow yourself the space to miss them when they are gone Afterwards he was able to have several conversations with fellow men in person who were also struggling with grief and they were healing conversations Vulnerability begets vulnerability A video is very public and should be carefully weighed but it also reaches a wide audience without making you repeat yourself on a painful topic and invites conversations from interested parties rather than forcing people into the uncomfortable place of feeling like an asshole if they are not prepared to be in a heavy conversation You can click off a video you cant as easily do that in person Its a strange world where we criticize people for posting exclusively good things in their lives bc that paints an unrealistic picture or is attention seeking  but then turn around and criticize them for posting feelings that are more raw and also exclusively call it bad attention seeking A lot of what we do online and offline can work to seek attention but that doesnt make those things bad Example: If you are injured and you seek the attention of a doctor- this is a good thing If you are perfectly healthy and inventing illnesses for the attention of a doctor this is obviously not good Intention and follow up matters for everything we put out there,mitchadew247,16268829990,4

h60pd7d,oop94z,A lot of good comments already but something that seems to have been missed is the generational aspect For boomers and earlier there has always been a stigma around sharing and expressing negative emotions Possible exceptions are that men are allowed to express anger and women are allowed to express negative emotions but only privately or with close friends This trend has slowly changed but Im 40 and I still feel the vestiges of that Younger millennials are more open and gen Z is even more so I think at least a portion of the feeling *I* get of "why would you ever do that" comes from my generational upbringing and culture Which is not to say gen Z cant also experience cringing at public displays but the context is much different within a culture that has learned to share almost everything,riemannzetajones,16268847280,1
h60s9jv,oop94z,Okay Ill answer completely honestly as someone who does this! (But its on the internet for my friends not my public accounts) Its usually 3 reasons for me: A I am struggling mentally and this is my cry for help because I am horrible at reaching out and telling someone Im struggling B Some of the pictures are funny as fuck I have one with a huge ass piece of snot and my eyes unfocused that just makes me wheeze This is why I take most crying pictures tbh I just post it with a joking caption so people know Im not serious C Sorry Im vain but I am a really pretty crier it makes my eyes look so bright Some of my best pictures are crying and I will not apologize for posting them to social media,Nestle13,16268859300,1

h6192g6,oop94z,Ill bite Ive done it recently as an adult for attention We are social creatures Attention is not always a bad thing Sometimes you need help Especially right now when people have been so isolated sometimes the only place to turn to is the internet Sometimes you do it because you have a following to bring attention to a cause that genuinely moves you Thats why I did it once about six months ago It wasnt planned I was talking about a cause I really believed in and got choked up but I didnt reshoot because it felt genuine and real and I thought it would get people to pay attention to the cause I was talking about I thought it would literally bring the cause more *attention* So yeah crying online is done for attention and thats not always a bad thing People talk all the time about looking for the signs that your friends are struggling that can be one of them and not everyone has friends they feel like they can turn to so they reach out into the void for anyone It can bring attention to a cause It can even signal to other people that it is ok to express emotion publicly (because it fucking is!!) and shaming people (especially impressionable teenagers who do it the most) is reinforcing the idea that showing emotion is a bad thing Thats toxic,halfwaythere88,16268929080,1

h61e1x5,oop94z,I dont do this so I dont know the answer but I have a rebuttal to the "its just attention seeking" argument that many people are making Crying IS at attention-seeking reflex at an evolutionary level It evolved as a means of communicating to other members of our social group that we need help The natural function of crying is social but culturally weve decided that crying should be completely private and that crying in front of others is shameful It has long been the norm way before social media to only present positive emotions Its part of why were told to smile for pictures because happiness is the most socially acceptable emotion to outwardly express I think this question plays into a stigma against mental health issues - it doesnt ask about people who record themselves laughing or smiling which are also social responses Its essentially asking "Why arent you hiding your sadness?" because expressing it is taboo In recent years many people on social media have been championing for honest outward emotion and candid discussions about struggles I think this is the right direction Seeing others express honest emotion can help someone who has been struggling and keeping it to themselves I think its especially true for tragedies that affect whole communities like natural disasters the death of an important person etc Seeing people cry publicly over it can help others process grief and know that they arent alone If people are posting videos of themselves crying because they need attention that shouldnt be looked down upon as a shameful thing Its somebody whos suffering and is alone often young people trapped inbad situations They need compassion not ridicule,echoskybound,16268949970,1

h0tmkll,ntofxm,This is a personal story but I think it does illustrate a greater point Ive told the story before and Ill try to keep it brief I used to live and work in South Africa with a charity organization and while there I became friends with a man originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo who was now in SA working with our group Eventually I ended up moving back to Canada but we still kept in touch sporadically over Facebook A couple of years went by and he stopped updating his profile It was sad but people move on and when you are half way around the world friendships can fade However a couple of years after that I was back in South Africa on holidays and I asked some mutual friends if they knew where he was so that maybe we could all meet up and catch up on old time Unfortunately all they knew was that he had moved away around the time he stopped updating his profile and no one knew where he ended up Another friend and I decided to try and track him down We ended up getting ahold of his family who were in Kinshasa DRC They knew that he had planed to go to Angola for a job opportunity but they too had not heard from him in well over a year Sadly I couldnt stay and continue on the search but my other friend did He found that he did indeed make it to Luanda in Angola and was heading towards a town called Luau near to the Angola/DRC border However this is where the trail went cold and he disappeared off the face of the earth No one knows what happened to him Maybe he fell ill and died and was quickly buried somewhere with no one being informed maybe he fell victim to foul play maybe in the vast wilderness he got lost or hurt or whatever We will never know We informed his family of what we found and they were grateful but they too have reached closure in feeling that he is dead Unfortunately that is the fate that could befall many itinerant workers and in many areas of developing countries there is few resources or will available to make more than a cursory search if that The point is it is possible for people to disappear even in this day and age Usually it is the less fortunate or itinerant people or those in areas too remote or undeveloped to have proper social safety nets to help them We rarely think of the possibly until it effects us or someone we know but it isnt that hard for us or a loved one to go missing and the ones left behind to never know what happened and that is a scary thought,badcgi,16230052930,2641

h0vyy8y,ntofxm,Helios Airways Flight 522 It was a flight from Larnarca Cyprus to Prague Czech Republic on 14th August 2005 The plane took off normally and climbed to altitude but shortly afterwards the pilots radioed in asking for help solving a technical problem as an alarm was going off in the cockpit After a few messages with the ground in which they seemed dazed and confused they went silent and the plane continued on and eventually began circling on autopilot As they could not raise the aircraft on radio a pair of fighters were scrambled to intercept and investigate They found that the plane was circling with no signs of life in the cabin and the pilots slumped at the controls Eventually as they watched a lone flight attendant entered into the cockpit and sat at the controls however they were unable to speak to him on the radio and he seemed unable to communicate Shortly afterwards the engines ran out of fuel and the plane spiralled down to the ground crashing on a hillside in Greece There were 121 people on board What had happened was that the pressurisation system had been turned off by maintenance to investigate a door problem and the pilots failed to turn it back on when they ran through three separate checklists When they radioed asking for help they were already suffering from oxygen deprivation and in their confusion they were unable to understand advice to check the pressure switch They passed out soon afterwards and the plane continued on autopilot The scary part is the lone flight attendant He was Andreas Prodromou a former special forces soldier and a trained pilot - but one who did *not* know how to fly a 737 Also on board was his girlfriend who was also a flight attendant for Helios He managed to remain conscious by using a portable oxygen bottle and there is evidence that he brought the oxygen bottle to the cockpit and strapped it to the pilots in an attempt to resuscitate them to no avail By the time he realized that something was terribly wrong and was able to make it into the cockpit theu were likely never going to wake up It was him that tried to take control of the plane just before it ran out of fuel The cockpit voice recorder also captured him making five separate Mayday calls - to no effect as he was tuned to the wrong frequency and out of range of the receiver To be the only one conscious on a plane with 120 silent people - including the woman that you love - knowing that they *might* still be alive and that youre their only hope head swimming from lack of oxygen and barely able to function as you struggle with the equivalent of being *above* the peak of Mount Everest is utterly horrifying for me Especially when the engines flamed out and it became apparent that there was no hope The last known action of Prodromou was to turn the plane away from Athens and towards an uninhabited area,ARabidDingo,16230536290,76

h0a8whd,nq9fjc,Affairs The hotel I worked at for a year had a strict privacy policy around this and you are told well its drilled into you "not our business" Unsure what its like these days but my entry level job in the travel booking world started as a travel planner for a 5 star chain in Melbourne Australia a couple of decades ago My station was next to reception (I looked like I was a part of reception but was on the end) and it was not uncommon to have the affair couple check in then while the affair partner was still checked in the cheating spouse would return the following day with spouse (sometimes spouse and kids) and check into another hotel room We were under strict instructions "not our business" But it wasnt uncommon on holidays for both spouse and affair partner to be in the same hotel at the same time Wasnt uncommon to see married people use the day stay program to cheat sometimes with the same person (affair partner) but on occasion someone new (its not below me to say I took some joy in knowing the cheater was being cheated on) However there is that "one" that will be seared on my brain forevermore A married couple both had rings on so I just assumed husband and wife were regulars at the hotel for weekend stays nice chatty folk (I was young so I didnt get many people stop and chat with me) I booked them on some day trips sunset dinner cruises etc mostly couple/romance geared packages and since ID wasnt required for both to make the bookings they never corrected me when I booked the itineraries in both names but with his surname (since he paid with his card I had his full name) So cut to a few months later this married man checks in but with a different woman *sigh* I will forever feel like a monster when that woman "snuck" downstairs to book herself and her husband the exact same romantic sunset cruise package that that man had booked with this other lady only a fortnight ago to celebrate the end of her chemo round She wouldnt stop talking about how this getaway was her thankyou gift to her husband who has been so amazing and supportive during this time typing it I still feel like the worst human that I choose my job (breach of privacy is instant dismissal) over telling her what was going on And yes that other woman (the woman who was having the affair with the married man whose wife was battling cancer) did turn up with her own husband and booked a dinner cruise and her last name on her ID was not the last name I had been using previously so that sealed it that they were having an affair together The other thing is drugs cocaine mostly Had a semi famous couple have their wedding reception and most guests were high best man passed out in the bathroom shat himself with the straw still up his nose Maid of honor pissed herself while sitting at the bridal table The cleaners see the worst of it I just worked up near reception and saw some bad things but no doubt the cleaners would have seen the worst of what hotels dont want the public to know about,smellyslipper,16226138010,297

The inspector will have a Zoom call between themselves and hotel management The inspector will instruct this management team to point the cameras in whatever device they are using towards different points in a room As you can imagine this is easily bullshitted Also inspections in general are very seldom done 2 times a year in most cases with the inspection of around 5-7 rooms total on a busy trip It also takes a LOT to lose your "flag" (aka the privilege of calling yourself *insert brand here*) Ive seen us float between "unacceptable" and "failure" for extended periods of time and alas we still got our flag Oh heres a good one: Review your stay Not just through the company directly but also on Yelp Travelocity Tripadvisor etc Hotel management really dont like negative reviews on third party sites lmao If a specific places MGMT dont seem too interested in hearing your bad experience I promise someone higher up will go into panic mode and do whatever it takes to save face once your bad experience becomes very public Through Hilton in particular they take "SALT scores" very seriously and it is even included in the scoring of those inspections I mentioned earlier I could go on for hours but I will just leave this comment with: Dont be too hard on general employees like housekeepers and the front desk employees night auditors etc for things beyond their own control Sure some employees can be awful or rude and feel free to mention them in a review or to MGMT but some of us really do care how your stay is going and are empathetic to your needs through whatever undesirable situation is unfolding And despite working here I couldnt afford to stay here for even a single night if I wanted to so yes I really do agree that the room rate is quite often "bullshit" And theres nothing more embarrassing than checking someone into a room that is listed as Vacant/Ready in system but actually dirty/occupied (youd be surprised how often this can happen) Well there is a lot more but Ill save that for another day Ohhh and if it seems like the room rate went up an extra few hundred dollars because theres a Holiday it probably did,sinkfla,16226341100,10
h0b0q8c,nq9fjc,I worked at one that used to be 5 stars Im talking about them being 5 stars in the late 70s early 80s KISS actually stayed and performed there while on tour once and they refused to let that go The location had an on site bowling alley 2 bars convention center reception hall 27 hole golf course 2 separate restaurants spa a dock on a nearby lake where they did boating water skiing and fishing expeditions a private beach on the lake and concert venue The place changed hands several times and most of the owners were good at maintaining the property and keeping things up to date until they decided to retire Before long the resort hotel ended up in one of those families where they wouldnt pay the taxes on the income it made and when the IRS came round they would use some loophole to transfer ownership of the resort to a family member who didnt owe anything so the IRS could chain the doors The owners decided that the spa was to expensive to maintain and so shut it all down including both the indoor and outdoor pools the sauna the Jacuzzis attached to the pools and the onsite gym The fired all the staff and sold off the massage beds gym equipment poolside furniture and other related items to make a quick buck They got an offer on the golf course and so sold it off firing a lot of employees in the process The problem was that the concert venue was on the other side of the golf course and they werent allowed to have people using the golf courses parking lot to get to the concerts so they just stopped using it and so it just sat and rotted Again they fired all the technicians who worked it The decided to make the convention center smaller to make it cheaper to maintain and so they remodeled and tore down around 80% of the building ironically making it to small to hold any conventions People stopped renting the now way to small of a place and so they just locked the doors and reduced staff since it wasnt needing cleaned and maintained as much They shut down both restaurants because of cost and fired the entire staff of both locations and started closing the bars down at 7PM most nights and would only open one if they knew there was going to be at least $100 over operating cost of opening the bar made Guest would come out of there rooms at 9PM for a nightcap and find the bar closed and locked The sold of the reception hall to another company that booked weddings bar mitzvahs and birthdays etc and fired the entire staff from there as well And they sold the docks beach and all the associated equipment to a competing tourism company firing the staff from there as well And then they closed off the bowling alley to the public and guest Due to the cost of maintaining the bowling alley they decided to fire all but one guy who was expected to do everything and only open it if a party was booked ahead of time And the rules to book made no sense Minimum was 50 people with a booking fee of $5000 for 3-4 hours of bowling Thats $100 a person Whos gonna pay $100 for what 2 or 3 rounds of bowling And that only covered your shoe and lane rentals I did NOT cover the cost of food or drinks Meanwhile elsewhere in town you could get 3 rounds in with shoe and lane rental for $20 So yeah once they made that decision that place was basically never re-opened The place went from a 5 star hotel with all sorts of on site amenities employing over 300 people to a roadside motel with a massive and empty parking lot employing just over 20 people The weird thing was that they still advertised on the hotel website the spa restaurants bowling bars pools golf course and all the other stuff They had to give out so many refunds when people arrived and found that the hotel didnt actually have those things anymore This was somehow blamed on the remaining staff who they began to lay off To replace these much needed people they would hire their friends but instead of offering the new employees actual pay the owners would give them a room to live in Basically heres your pay minus rent for your room After replacing nearly the entire staff the owners officially closed off an entire wing so the staff could live there Which was illegal at the time and any time an inspection came through the employees would have to pack their belongings and leave They would also open the bar for these people at like 1 or 2 AM so they could have loud parties disturbing the actual guest With the employees living on site the lack of actual amenities and the false advertising it wasnt long until the hotel had a bad reputation This meant that we had to lower cost $45 a night cash And eventually lowered again to $30 cash and then $25 cash Needless to say the hotel became known as the place you go for a cheap room for prostitution affairs drug deals runaways riotous parties drug fuel benders the production of porn There was even a case where a guy was caught using the cheap rooms to make child pornography with his 9 and 12 year old daughters I was eventually the only one on staff left over from the hotels glory days and since I didnt live on site I had to actually be paid The new owners insisted on paying me under the table And I wouldnt leave at the end of each shift until Id gotten my pay because I didnt trust them So naturally in an effort to cut cost they really wanted to fire me but couldnt as none of their friends would work as the night porter That would cut into their drinking at the bar at 2AM Then one day one of our more loyal 2-hours-at-a-time customers asked for the hair dryer in her room be replaced as it wasnt working I called down to house-keeping and informed them of the request and room number and they said theyd get on it Instead they sat in the breakroom smoking pot The customer complained and I was terminated I got a part time job moving furniture a few days later Less than a week later the owners told all the employees that an inspection was coming so they packed up and left The inspection found bed bugs and so the owners responded by packing anything of value into a moving truck putting chains on the door and turning off the power Apparently it was cheaper and easier to shut down then it was to fumigate Everyone left working there suddenly found themselves jobless and homeless And then it came out that the owners had embezzled over 10 million dollars from the hotel and thats why suddenly everything was too expensive to maintain and needed sold off Money they also pocketed,ThorsHammer0999,16226367170,8

I worked in a hotel doing an exchange program where I use my summer vacation of the university to work during winter in the United States It was an opportunity to be for the 1st time in another country and the 1st time living without my parents but to do this we have to pay a lot at the time the hotel hired more than 300 students from South America to be there for 3 to 4 months and of course many of those had a good life didnt need to raise money for this trip The hotel it was big there was more than 20 villages some of them where houses with families living there and people there doesnt know that many of the housekeeping had a good life like then or even better because of this we were seeing like someone how are struggling in life even getting stuffs like once a man who lived in one of the houses was throwing away a long-sleeved shirt that we got on his birthday and give to me he hated it the shirt I say yes and thanks him it is a good piece of clothing to winter especially in a country where we dont have control of temperature in the houses and the winter in my region is like the winter of the panhandle where I was &#x200B; By the way 300 students living in the same building in a place in the middle of nowhere without public transportation drinking every day was the best option to enjoy the free time so most of the housekeeping where with hangover almost all the time,macedao,16238061920,2

It was as though saying that somehow ignored what I was telling them I need I learned people say this when they dont know what to say or dont want to actually do something** Like here I am in a hospital bed asking you for that help you said I could ask for I know that Ive helped you but now that I just need this rudimentary help while Im being treated at the hospital no one is there Not even family Ive gone out and visited friends hosted events for them helped them in many ways and it can be for years And yet if I ask to be visited or for help theres nothing Sometimes they wont even let me know they cant show up for things like my birthday until hours into the party starting time Some people just want to "piggybank" you dropping figurative social coins into you so that you show up for them but they may never show up for you Ive spent years talking to someone wondering what it would take for them to ever fucking visit me to have them literally show up once in over 5 years of a friendship **I feel like an idiot for having invested so much of myself time money and genuine love to realize they do not want to invest even a fraction in reciprocation** "Were friends for life now" some have said to me and weve shared deep things But its always in public chat groups and we never converse in private Ive learned some people know how to be emphatic and seem really caring but often it seems all they really care about is a performative friendship: the sing and dance of a friendship but when you genuinely want to talk and open up about a conflict to really ask for help to work through something its not what theyre there for **Theyre there for the superficial and entertaining the positive only and the negative - whatever it may be - is not what they are there for** I dont know anymore what a real friendship is Im left really wondering if Im the problem The proverb "if everyone is the problem then its you" rings in my head: I must be the problem because every relationship has similar issues: **lack of genuine connection** If I start to open up and share genuine feelings its a burden And most of the time Im just asking to be heard nothing more and I really only do this when it feels like it could be accepted Im not opening up relationships like this You have to wait till rapport feels like its acceptable to be vulnerable and authentic But even when you do theres the risk that youre not compatible Or maybe Im completely wrong and I have a massive issue I need to address that Im just not seeing Ive been in therapy for a while and my consistent issue is that Im emotionally confused about my own self So tl;dr I dont fucking know,onus111,16254992330,84

hj0y78c,oe5uja,Took me a 3 year period of agonizing doubt to figure out Noticed a pattern of them leaving me without saying goodbye hanging out in my neighborhood without inviting me getting pushed away from the group while walking me always having to say hello first and not being greeted if I didnt getting abandoned in public if I had to stop for something and then having to catch up etc Things were always too subtle for me to actually see them for what they are because they did help me out quite a few times in times of need But those off behaviors always occurred for me to think they simply tolerated having me around Ive got a great diversity of friends who genuinely love me so I know what genuine friendship is supposed to feel like So I feel entirely stupid for taking so long to realize this group wasnt as invested in me as I was in them It took me a long time to realize red flags in some of the people in the group such as general arrogance and superiority complexes gossiping etc I still dont know if Im making the right decision because everything about that groups negative behavior feels very subtle for me to make a concrete decision because in a lot of cases they come across as healthy intelligent people But if my gut feeling goes off the radar every time I hang out with them if I feel drained in their company when I normally dont with other groups its a problem with them and not me The best thing for me to do is to walk away from them Im still under a lot of pain and cognitive dissonance as I right this feels like Im going crazy but I know I need to trust my gut Cut out a lot of detail to fit here but I feel Ive been gaslit in many instances by the "leader" of this group,Automatic_Fishing451,16358692980,3
h456fes,oe5uja,Like anyone Ive had a few breakups over the years Most were pretty normal some I stayed friends with afterwards One in particular was super volatile but I wasnt made aware of it at first Had a whole swath of friends that immediately stopped talking to me wouldnt say why looked at me like I was the spawn of satan when Id run into them in public So I wrote it off as an unsatisfying and baffling mystery Took about 2 years before things eventually filtered back to me through the grapevine - she had made up a ton of crap about me that never happened and turned all of our mutual friends against me Every so often I still hear a new and exciting thing that I did despite the 7 years that have passed My favorites were the things that were literally impossible for me to have done since I moved with my wife and kids 300 miles away from where I was supposedly doing said things (like driving by her house at all hours even though Im asleep in bed in another city) On a complete opposite note I discovered some true friends that I had pushed away earlier in life when I was going through some difficulties that had nothing to do with them Theyve been there for me (and vice-versa since I got over myself) through anything and even though we dont see each other often I could call them up any time and theyd be here in a heartbeat and Id be there for them Essentially I made up a conflict in my head similar to what actually happened later and it was a bit eye opening once I realized that any distance between us was my own doing That realization ended up changing my interactions with everyone for the better and I have some life-long friends that will always be close while not worrying as much about those who ran away over someone elses issues,chompsky,16255033750,2

h48jcjr,oe5uja,this one isnt too serious but it definitely had me thinking about the people I came across in 5th grade when I was 11 I had a best friend who would was a terrible influence on me though she was my only friend at the time so anytime we had any fuss fights Id have no one to lean on i was attached to her even though she would physically start altercations with me in public for all to see she would beat me down and wed just get into it infront of our class everytime she took the time to just randomly hit me Id hit her back with much more force; my reasoning being "thatll teach you not to hit me anymore" but it never worked she would still continue to belittle and humiliate me infront of public(which is terrible now that I realize it because my classmates had literally joined in stomping me to the ground after my best friend pushed me) they hated me and I never knew why I wasnt exactly nice to everyone but I was never flat out rude just a monotone kid as Id say half a year into the 5th grade school year me and my companion had a little altercation we were sitting at the lunch table for breakfast before school started she grabbed me by my backpack and dragged me into the front of the lunchroom for everyone to see- I begged and pleaded for her to stop clinging to lunch table even because I literally had done nothing but small talk her that morning one of my other classmates joined in and they both spent 7 minutes pulling on me to let go of dear life on that lunch table and my fingers slipped so- once I had let go of my backpack (off of my shoulders) the other girl pulled my hair and draggedme around in a circle I was on the verge of tears because all the other girls in the cafeteria were laughing and no one had stepped in to help me at all though I didnt let the two of them get the better of me I had got up and was about to fist fight my best friend until she up and scratched my eye with her hand(she used her nails-) I was so glad I didnt lose my fucking eye that year because if my left eye were open I wouldve been blind in it it left a scar for 2 years I can barely see it now but others often compared me to kakashi hatake and I never knew how to take it (as a compliment or not) at the time to Naiima fuck you Ive never felt so humiliated in my life for that time period of being your friend,nai_novaa,16255792670,2

And then she ignored me I think she was embarrassed by me Admittedly I was a weird kid Undiagnosed ADHD and Aspergers will do that I eventually ended up with new friends who mostly just ate with me at lunch and didnt even talk to me all that often except when I was trying to pay attention in class What clued me into them not being real friends was when theyd invite themselves over for sleepovers Theyd borrow money for candy I couldnt eat without ever paying me back leave gum and ground up candy embedded in the parlors **shag** carpet (we didnt actually use it as a parlor more a general purpose room and the carpet was left over from the previous owners) and then the final straw one of them invited me to her house **after** telling me about how her brother physically bullied her and making me swear not to tell I **agonized** over telling Mom about the secret because I knew shed probably say yes to the invitation if I didnt but Id **promised** not to tell! Luckily I was able to talk to her privately before she made a decision and asked if it was ever okay to tell a secret She assured me that some secrets arent worth keeping especially if it could hurt someone So I told her **everything** There wasnt enough details for us to get involved and knowing that particular girl she couldve been lying to get a reaction Either way and after a long talk about their behavior and the mess they always left they were never allowed back Edit: I was **twelve**,Irish_Brigid,16254987220,1

h44zru0,oe5uja,theres a couple incidents that I could think of but the most recent of them all (not 100% sure about this but some simple algebra and I can put enough pieces together) our carpark at school is very tight and has few spaces and the members of the public love to park there despite it being a student only carpark anyway at lunch we go out and get lunch sometimes and when we get back there is obviously never enough parks left out of the 3 or 4 cars we took that lunch I was the last and there was only one park available - however the person to the left of this park was on the line and due to cars parked next to the curb I couldnt fit my rather large car in this park obviously due to the angle and the tightness of the park I started to scrape the car next to me (another students) and because it was plastic on metal I couldnt hear shit I kept going - more focussed on not hitting the car to my left that I completely forgot about the car to my right this caused my fender to start to scrape on this car and it caused a massive scratch about 15 cm in length I later found out that half a dozen of my mates watched as I hit the plastic and then let me keep going and scrape the metal - the repair job went from a $50 buffout to a $1400 respray some friends I have,Breno_17,16255000290,1

gy4s3ow,nc8fis,I think it can go both ways Often it is the aggressive person filming In half of those Ive viewed it is because they genuinely think they are in the right The other half seems to be a provocation But then there is another type of video where the non-aggressor records someone in order to have evidence if they become more aggressive This seems completely legitimate to me Id probably do the same And although I may frequent r/publicfreakouts from time to time I have no interest in making someone internet infamous If I did record someone only to later realize that I just caught them having a bad day I hope Id simply keep the video to myself We all have our moments Im glad a cell phone didnt record my worst,daveescaped,16210187090,2

gy5a3sa,nc8fis,I was at a local taco shop There were two females sitting at a table with one guy and the guy was *very* verbally abusive to one of the ladies He was berating her in public because she never "had to work for anything in life" He talked about her privilege and yata yata yata She was clearly uncomfortable and both women tried to change the conversation but he wouldnt stop berating her So I took out my phone and started recording him He saw me and immediately stopped I wasnt trying to be a hero or anything but I didnt know them to personally intervene nor did I feel comfortable with doing so I just remembered a video I saw a while ago on how to indirectly intervene during confrontation and tried to put it in practice I just wanted him to leave her alone,missdoublefinger,16210268440,2
gy5at28,nc8fis,I assume so that they can post the videos online and get meaningless internet points Unfortunately people are allowed to film in public places so the only way to discourage this shitty behaviour is to avoid watching the videos I unsubscribed from r/publicfreakout a while ago for this very reason It just seemed wrong to participate in a sub that mostly exists to publicly shame people having a bad day/mental breakdown/whatever,cousin_will,16210271730,2
gy5kmsy,nc8fis,I was friends with a girl who was kidnapped on a night out during her first year of college She was held captive for days and gang raped repeatedly For some reason they drove her back to the dorm parking lot and shoved her out of the car She didnt tell anyone stopped going to class got dropped by her sorority and started drinking heavily She had a psychotic break and eventually got out in rehab where she opened up about the incident to a select few people but had a very hard time talking about it She was obviously still in a lot of pain She relapsed and got hammered at a college football tailgate party The cops arrested her for public and underage intox She told me later that when shed gotten so wasted she didnt even know where she was or what was going on when the cops initially detained her She said she immediately went back to being held down by that group of men that repeatedly raped her for days She started sobbing and screaming "Dont fucking touch me! Get the fuck off me! No! Stop!" At some point she realizes whats happening and the fear terror morphs to rage She starts screaming stuff like "Where were you? Where the fuck were you when they raped me?" Some evil miserable mom tailgating with her college age kids filmed the whole thing and posted it everywhere When I was presented the video I hadnt heard the full story I declined to view it out of respect thinking it was just her being arrested but when I overheard the audio I just started crying and laid into every single girl gawking at it demanding they shut it off It was truly harrowing The comments were disgusting I tracked down the lady that posted the video and desperately tried reasoning with her but she thought it was hilarious and that this girl was a slutty sinful brat getting what she deserved This appalled me so I went to bat for her in the public comments and I got eaten alive The general consensus of a community like that being she was either crying rape to get off the hook or essentially that she should be shamed for choosing to get so irresponsibly drunk and choosing to have a flashback in public This still makes my stomach churn She was basically a kid that had experienced horrific trauma She needed help not a record and ridicule She wasnt hurting anyone she was literally crying for help after being terribly abused and failed by the system That being said you should always assume youre on camera Maybe if someone filmed the man abducting my friend he would have been caught before getting the chance to torture her for days You shouldnt be upset about being held accountable for your actions good day or not Theres no excuse for being racist or throwing a temper tantrum and theres no excuse for being a sick and posting videos of people in distress that arent hurting anyone Our cameras should be used to help protect ourselves and each other and not to bully people,leakyfaucetofmydoom,16210318970,2
gy5svct,nc8fis,To me this phenomenon is fucking terrifying I have PTSD from my abusive family I fled my family but I dont have the resources to go far I am currently hiding in plain sight several cities away and trying to keep as low a profile as possible I specifically chose the job I have because its a 1 on 1 environment where the people I work with have zero interest in telling people that they are receiving my services My entire life is oriented around attracting as little attention as possible I am terrified to go out in public alone because if I have an episode and someone records me it could go viral and then my family would know what I now look like and where I am If your life is genuinely under threat or your in traffic having a camera and recording isnt an issue It is good to have evidence to turn over to the police or lawyers in the event of a civil suit I am disgusted by and scared of people who think its funny or entertaining to record people who are struggling Whether it be mental health issues drugs anger "epic fails" or the like recordings of those those things that get posted on social media never interest me In fact all i think about is how awful of a person the one recording is TLDR; posting random videos of people hoping they go viral is dangerous You have no idea if exposing someones appearance and location could get them killed or put them in life threatening danger Even if someone is being a cunty karenesque person do you really want your video to be the reason for the headline "Former viral video subject murdered by Ex due to media exposure"?,MetamorphicMadelaina,16210362100,2

gy4dsbs,nc8fis,i cant say for sure as im not one of these people but i have two guesses knowing people who do Number one is imaginary internet points You capture something others find interesting or entertaining regardless of privacy or the respect of those involved and you can garner many fake internet points both here and on other platforms so in some ways you could ask those who "upvote/like/etc" these posts why they do it &#x200B; the second theory i have has to do with the fact that when something is actively happening around you in public regardless of the intention of those involved if you can see it or hear it and youre not likebreaking into anybodys houseits happening to you to kind of at least its happening in your vicinity and thus the expectation of privacy is gone you have become involved in this particular public incident not of your own free will but by the will of those who are actually taking part as a result some people feel the need to film and capture things that happen to or near them to share with family we live in a "pics or it didnt happen" society so its almost just a default behavior &#x200B; for me if i ever do film strangers its usually in situations where i was very curious what was happening but didnt have time to find out while there (like im driving) so ill snap a pic this is mostly when i see police involved and im just curious as to why,ackley14,16210125060,1

gy4pznw,nc8fis,Recorded 2 strangers while on public transport (a tram) who were arguing very loud but you could only see my leg so it did not show their faces just their voices Reason I did it was because this kind of fighting happened all the time pre covid while on public transport but whenever I would tell my family my brother would go naah that didnt happen So I recorded it and when I came home and told my family everyone thought the fight was really funny but my brother went Naah that didnt happen untill I showed him the video,srhfay,16210177870,1

gual1pz,mpf8nh,I need some upvotes please Mary Susan Humphrey was last seen by friends on Friday May 30 1980 in Valdosta Georgia after leaving Gregos which was a popular night club in the 80s with a male she met that night Humphrey was a Moody Air Force Base Airman First Class assigned as an air traffic controller who lived off base near Walkers Crossing Humphrey left the bar and went to the mans apartment off Forrest Street in Valdosta The man told officers that Humphrey wanted to go home around 3:00 am and she left his apartment walking down Forrest Street near Park Avenue Humphrey was a white female 23 YOA with red hair stood 53" tall and weighed 128 pounds Humphrey was originally from Lenexa Kansas and was stationed at Moody Air Force Base Humphrey was last seen wearing a long sleeve burgundy in color shirt and dark colored slacks On Sunday June 15 1980 Humphreys body was discovered about 50 feet off a dirt road known as Old Willacoochee Road or more commonly called Double Bridge Road in Berrien County by a group of men running their hunting dogs The investigation led law enforcement at the time to arrest a former boyfriend of Humphrey He was tried and acquitted by a Berrien County Jury on October 10 1980 The GBI Douglas Office is asking for any assistance or information from the public which would lead to the identity of the person(s) responsible for the murder of Mary Susan Humphrey The Humphrey family has remained in touch with investigators and would greatly appreciate getting closure for the loss of their loved one This is an active investigation,Intherecord,16182584310,-34

h8x3ohd,p3w5k9,This one still bothers me to this day because I can barely make sense of it I used to date this girl when I was 19 Very pretty and normal looking kinda like a blonde Victoria Justice Her parents left for a trip to Paris so she called me to come over Ive met her parents before for dinner at a restaurant and they also seemed very normal Almost Flanders-like in how nice they were but they were not religious It was my first time being over at their house Again very normal looking and clean Everything was well kept and organized Anyway we do what two teenagers do when left alone and after she had to go shower and clean up However I was holding on from pooping because when you are 19 your erection overrides all other impulses so I had to look for another bathroom I could take a dump into while shes showering I figure I could do a stealth dump in her parents master bedroom bathroom across the hall since theyre gone for weeks anyway However when I opened the bathroom door I was greeted by an overwhelming stench of shit worse than a non-maintained public toilet The bath tub was filled with shit I only glanced at it for a split second but it was like that bath tub in Silence of the Lambs but with lots of floating solid shit At that point I really dont feel like shitting anymore and is resisting vomiting To this day the image of it still haunts my nightmares and the smell I can never forget I thought maybe the pipes burst and it leaked into the tub But when I told her that she just did a long sigh and sat me down She said that its something her mother did She would collect her shit in the tub and they just leave the exhaust fans on and that master bedroom bathroom door closed all the time Her mother literally piled poop on the tub for some reason and the entire family accepted like this was part of her process I just pretended to accept it of course because she was so hot and just nodded that I understood it was some sort of compulsion Although I think she kinda knew I was definitely weirded out by it and we eventually broke up a few months later That was the only time Ive been to their house and Ive tried avoiding dinner invites because I dont think I can look her mother in the eye,RonTRobot,16289544760,10

h8yphl5,p3w5k9,I have a good one Brief background I grew up in a boring middle class suburb in the southwest We briefly moved away and came back This was during the housing boom in 2006 so my parents bought a house way out in what used to be the boonies The public school system was pretty rough and underfunded so my parents had this idea that I should spend 8th grade at a charter school as a bridge to high school The school we ultimately settled on was a charter school (for kids who got expelled from other schools) in a rough area of town It was a formative year for me let me tell you I made this friend well call him Josh We used to ride the city bus from school to Joshs house all the time One time we were at Joshs house and we watched with a few other guys an entire hentai movie (2hrs or so tons of cartoon sex) his idea in the living room We watched several porn videos that day It was how I learned internet video porn existed 13 year old me was of course going to partake His mom did not care Hindsight how weird,Leewashere21,16289804070,4
h8vcs8y,p3w5k9,The mother beating the shit out of the kids ( not so much as like little kids but like 13-16 years old so still kids ) Later i learned by having a bunch of friends that are from islands ( islanders Micronesians Samoans Tongans etc ) Turns out islands specifically Samoans and Tongans their parents litterally beat the shit out of the kids to keep them in line Girls Boys it doesnt matter Whatevers close is a weapon usually a shoe or some sort of cooking utensil in the kitchen And im talking not like a swat on the ass or a dress down Im talking like straight up giving them the business Not one swing not a half hearted swing no half stepping bullshit Im talking mom was like an ex-mma fighter whos parents were probablly the same lineage and beat the shit out of her and her siblings So it continues and the kids get their asses straight up kicked However the family was always nice and the kids were well obviously the kids were very well mannered of course until the mother or father found out that they did something wrong Come home late got in trouble with the cops found some weed on them got caught smoking cigarettes Or one beating i saw was because of the younger of the brothers was caught with beetlenut and had like a stash of all the things used to "chew it" A few cigarettes some leaves of some kind beetlenuts that were fresh so he obviously went to the local asian market and purchased em there the knives or razors to cut the beetlenut the like crushed up coral mixed with something to make some sort of paste and everything else needed in this little stash box he made a hiding placei n his room for (which all of this was forbidden in this household until a certain age or just period no questions asked ) Anyways beetlenut is some sort of local ( to them ) like chew Its this hard green nut ( fresh ) that you slice like 4 times and then take a piece of it along with a bit of loose tobacco from a cigarette some of that coral paste stuff and then wrap it up in this leaf thing Put in mouth Over time it fucks your teeth way up and can turn your lips red ( never have seen this but once i looked it up you see pictures of women of the islands with like blood red lips from the beetlenut chewing/chewage ) Anyways mom made him make one for him and all his siblings ( not all of which embibed in this stuff ) and then chew it For a long ass time Huge ass "servings" While this was happening she beat a few of the kids asses like punches and kicks and then once she got to the culprit it was one of the sickest beat downs with a shoe that ive ever personally seen Not the boomerang eddie murphy stand up style beat down Nope Beat down like this kid stole your money killed your dog burnt your house down or some other felonious crime youd think Bruises and lots of "holy shits" from me ( said internally as i sort of slowly backed away from the action and just watched in horror ) After it was done everyone went about their business like normal fucking day Later on it turns out these beatings happened a lot if the kids stepped out of line of which there were many so many many beat downs Funny thing is: Samoans and Islanders in general that ive known have always been some of the most Loving Generous Honest Loyal Friendliest and soft spoken people of which many i consider great and close friends Ones that would be there in a pinch always put family first and friends if youre close enough were like family They would do anything for you and I in turn did the same because people that like that with morals and general ideals are few and far between Soft Spoken but also when the shit in the fan some of the biggest islanders i knew were the first to stand up step in front of me or whoever was being bullied and challenged and would straight up stomp the shit out of people And then "Hey bruh lets go get a beer or some food" in the sweetest softest voice youve ever heard So maybe as a parent im doing it wrong since these kids obeyed their parents like they were the damn KGB or Mossad or something - if they breached the line or protocol they would get dealt with asap Almost to the point of going home just to get the ass whooping and get it over with Great people Weird upbringing violence and even the girls got their asses kicked But not only being some of the most beautiful girls ive ever seen they are kick ass people and great friends Also they could fight with the best of em and ive even seen a girl put a guy down with a few quick punches and again the group i was with this was normal while the guy who was being a dick and put his hands on the girl while trying to spit some game ( touching not wanted ) got what he deserved **TL;DR**: Islanders will sometimes get the shit beat out of them by the parents for rule breakage or just crossing the many lines set by the parents to the point of oh shit holy shit like MMA beat downs in public or private wherever the knowledge of the infraction was learned That said they are also some of the best friends greatest people faithful honest tough well mannered and just overall soft spoken and soul filled folks ive ever had the pleasure of meeting in my life and am proud to know a few that i can call friends if not family,itsjero,16289123890,16
h8w3ykf,p3w5k9,Technically not a visit but made me wonder what was going on in their house On late high school I had a friend who was just so weird and damaged The first thing which is what I came to comment before remembering a whole bunch of things that will follow this point was food Me and him took a complimentary course after school in the same college so we often rode the bus together Our mothers decided to join forces to get us quick snacks for lunch we could eat on the bus on our tight schedule They took turns and each day one of us would bring lunch My mother who is a pretty excellent cook would get us all sorts of stuff like sandwiches pies empanadas and shit For a whole year at every single time that he brought lunch his mother always cooked Kibbeh (middle eastern mix of meat grain and spice) On spring break I briefly visited him and his house was an absolute mess Dead (and alive) roaches galore piles of rubbish and broken old tech all around but what really stuck with me was his desk The place where he studied had such a thick layer of dust it was unlike anything Ive ever seen It looked like volcanic ash not dust And he just acted like that was absolutely normal because "he didnt have time to clean it up" And yeah maybe careless parenting got him there but he was a really shitty person too He used to unironically say that his dream was to reach 18 years old get out of his house and take his fathers old car (an absolutely disgusting old and broken down Fiat Fiorino) get into a community college and just live on the back of the car on campus His father was still around but he said hed hoped he would die before he got 18 so he could just take the car He was an elitist prick too Because he was white blonde and had blue eyes he would joke about being a neo-nazi and I could never really tell how much he was joking or not Specially because once he hooked up with a darker skinned girl from the college (Im not saying black because she wasnt really black she was more mixed? Thats more of a thing here in Brazil) and since I took the bus with him i was with them when it happened After she left he said that he didnt want me telling anyone he hooked up with an "n-word" He used to punch me on the balls if I was standing up on the bus too just to make others laugh A couple of years after school I ran into him again at this point I was already steady at a good job and in my sophomore year in college He was still trying to get into the public college Once he spotted me he asked me "how Ive been" When I started replying he interrupted me and said "Yeah yeah just pretend I cared for whatever you were saying Listen you used to be good at geopolitics can you explain whats going on on Syria? I feel like thats going to be the theme of an essay for college" Fun guy Hope things worked out fine for him,jp_1896,16289319360,6
h8w2pl2,p3w5k9,Was 13 and made a new friend in high school Organised the first sleepover which was to be at her house Was super excited but also nervous to meet her parents and younger brother They had a quite large two-storey wooden house Her mum was a nurse and dad was a public servant who was also a volunteer firefighter Her dad was a very tall and well-built man intimidating for a 13yr old Well within 30mins of being there her father told us we were doing a fire drill - as everyone needs to know how to get out of the house in the event of a fire Had to go to my friends bedroom where I was sleeping for the night get on all fours and be blindfolded Then had 1 min to crawl to an exit Her father had a stopwatch timing me!! Crawled so fast to an exit and was seriously panicking all night if there was going to be an accidental fire! They acted like it was just a normal thing to be doing Twist in the story though: I was best friends with her for a long time and well the fire evac training was worth it as about 3 years later we nearly accident burnt the parents house down in a late night teen drinking and candle mishap Training actually came in good use getting out and calling emergency,mashable88,16289308530,2

But they explained that thats how it is in their house and offered to look away while I went Later we go upstairs Im having an anxiety attack because I just took a public poop in my friends basement and her parents give us half warm dino nuggets I stopped hanging out with Kaylee after this I told my mom when I got home and she didnt believe me Still doesnt to this day and that was over 15 years ago,Daroah,16289467780,2

CowBOY! (Just to provide some context I did ride horses and we had cows on our farm- horse culture is weird) I was very boyish growing up so Im sure my parents were surprised when I grew up into a straight fairly feminine woman Luckily my parents were very tolerant of my extreme tomboyishness and never pushed me toward typical "girl" stuff they just let it sort itself out Looking back thats something I really appreciate Fast forward to a few years later when I discovered the band Green Day I became obsessed with them especially the lead singer Billie Joe I plastered an entire wall of my room with pictures of him that I had printed off the internet My mom would just come up and shake her head and go "why do you like him so much? He wears too much eyeliner" And I would be like mom you dont understand hes my SOULMATE we just havent met yet After that came my skater wannabe phase which was pretty unremarkable followed by my scene phase Ugh I never achieved full scene queen status as I was not allowed to dye my hair wild colors or buy some of the clothing required for the whole ensemble and I am thankful now that I wasnt allowed to ruin my hair or get snakebite piercings and such I did make my hair as scene as possible with the deep side part and tons of teasing and hairspray And the music Lord It was fun though going to all the little local emo band concerts with my scene friends and I have a lot of good memories from that time I listen to some of the music for nostalgia sometimes even though I cant really stand that whiny shit lol Nowadays I am kind of a grown up scene kid who loves metalcore and deathcore but who dresses and acts like a normal person One of the things I think my mom really saved me from was my toxic ass ex who I started dating when I was like 17 and continued to date for two and a half years Everyone hated him and my family especially fought it so hard I thought it was meant to be even though deep down I knew it wasnt I think they could see that Anyway I ended up getting pregnant and my mom threatened to disown me if I had the baby because she didnt want me to be tied to this guy for life I know it sounds fucked up and a lot of people think Im a horrible person because of it but I didnt have the baby and it was hands down the best decision I ever made in my life (other than marrying my current husband which wouldnt have happened if things didnt unfold like they did) Me and the guy broke up he stalked me and threatened to kill me for like 6 months (hello true colors) and then finally I moved on to live a very happy life I shudder to think where I would be if my mom hadnt been there as my voice of reason,International_Emu_5,16202198090,2

h7b70j3,ovnbun,Former Make-A-Wish employee here! Just wanted to clarify that the org grants wishes to kids with life-threatening medical conditions not terminal Many wish kids find the experience of receiving a wish to give them hope for the future and make childhood memories that have nothing to do with their illness In addition to my work with the org I was a volunteer wishgranter for 5+ years; I still keep in touch with some of the kids I met who have now gone to college gotten married and in some cases had kids of their own I encourage you to see how you can volunteer with or give to your local chapter - its really an amazing organization! ***** Edited to add a few notes on how to volunteer! There are lots of ways to get involved: - Wishgranting volunteers go in teams of two to meet with wish kids and listen to them describe their one true wish They travel to the familys home or a public place help with paperwork and send the family off on their wish experience Its the most time intensive of the volunteer commitments but extremely rewarding Another former employee went into detail earlier in the thread - Translator/interpreter volunteers accompany wishgranting volunteers on wishes (or help out over the phone) to help ensure every family feels comfortable heard and understood throughout the whole process - Event employees help out with fundraising events like walk a thons golf outings and galas helping to check people in coordinate logistics and make sure everyone has a great experience - Office volunteers help around the chapter offices stuffing envelopes for holiday mailings filing paperwork etc Your local chapter might have more opportunities beyond the ones Ive listed - check them out here: https://wishorg/volunteer,AGhostDoingABadJob,16278240460,1119

gx6izve,n68cj4,"Cancel culture" is a whole complex can of worms that i dont want to get into so ill just say that sometimes people do dumb things and sometimes there are consequences for that And sometimes the consequences fit the action and sometimes they dont And its good that there is now a mechanism to bring to bear on powerful people who had previously been able to act out in very negative ways with impunity but its bad that sometimes comparatively innocent people can get caught in the meat grinder of public opinion and outrage in ways that have outsize and disproportionate affects on their lives But what really grinds my apple bags is that sometimes when someone gets caught in one of these undertows of public opinion deservedly or not and the world doesnt just stop their forward momentum (firing them drying up their future contracts putting them in movie jail etc) but retroactively deletes their past work as well removing their work from archives blocking access to their pieces scrubbing their name and projects from the Internet I understand we dont want to celebrate these artists anymore but what do we gain by pretending they never existed? Art does not exist in a vacuum sure and the context of the artist makes a difference But it seems like a criminally easy way out to just put blinders on and never look at them or their work again instead of taking the time to examine and internalize the art under the new lens and context of what we now know about the artist And more than that it just feels too much like the book burnings and book bannings of the past - destroying a thing simply because we dont approve of it ignoring all other value it might have beyond the one part of it that makes us upset,Saintbaba,16203261380,2

Sure why not The party consisted of an arcane trickster with underground connections a stone oracle with tremor sense a debuffing wizard and a Shadowdancer bloodrager So there were reoccurring system of underground casinos in this kingdom It doubled as a black market and characters could buy/sell magic items that were more questionable there It was a nice flavor to the setting and the arcane trickster has been making connections there since session 2 (we were over a year into the campaign) No one talks about them but everyone knows they exist type of thing think prohibition era speak-easy However anything that disturbs the peace is swiftly and severely punished using extra-lawful methods Any cheating in the casino or any spells being cast at all is promptly investigated by high level investigators and it was made clear that they will most likely be caught Well they needed to kidnap to noblemen They knew which casino they go to Challenges: The staff (other than security) are forbidden from bringing ANYTHING of their own on the job and are searched every hour at random times There is a constant alarm in public areas so any spell (magic divine or psionic) would be instantly detected All items going in or out were searched and catalogued There were anti-divination wards everywhere and everywhere that was staff only were fully covered with anti-magic circles anti-divination circles anti-psionic circles the whole deal Servers would replace decks of cards periodically to prevent any sort of cheating and all decks were examined before the servers could see them Arcane trickster volunteered to work at the casino as a dealer and after showing off his dexterity and being a well known member of this particular community (it was the partys home base city) The shadow dancer was quite attractive and got a job as a server as his private security in case things went south and they needed to brute force their way out They found that each room was independently warded and that doorways actually stood between the anti-magic wards The heist was on The stone oracle stone glided beneath the establishment and set up a cave beneath them He could tremor sense and feel everything going on at the table our trickster was at This was where he and the wizard were at They also stashed the deck of cards in the alley next to the casino At the beginning of the shift our arcane trickster tapped the four corners of the table to help calibrate Once their targets entered and eventually they played at his table The shadowdancer went to replace his cards She went to the back got some of the pre-approved decks She moved the lamp to cast a shadow on the doorway As she stepped through the doorway she jumped to a shadow outside the casino replaced the deck and jumped back into the doorway He was now dealing with the magic 1d2 damage deck Every time he dealt one of them he would declare an attack on the table Eventually the table shook due to the 1d2 damage This let the oracle know via tremmorsense where the nobles were He earth glided up through the ground and grabbed their ankles pulling them through the stone into his layer where the wizard had spells prepared to blind silence and deafen them The trickster threw the table over to help them announcing he was actually using it as a launcher for the cards to ranged attack the ground All traces of magic left every card The heist was successful and they werent caught The authorities also couldnt tell where he was the night of the kidnapping because of how taboo talking about the casinos is,Samurai_Banette,16230916100,4

h5h9imp,olspwd,I (33f) dont personally feel particularly unsafe walking alone at night which is helpful because the first two years I lived in Los Angeles I worked late and didnt have a car so I had to rely on public transportation The first month I lived in Hollywood I was getting off the last Red Line train at Hollywood/Highland at like 2am and saw a guy whod just been stabbed bleeding out on the sidewalk in front of the Forever 21 near the corner The blood was running down the stars on the sidewalk toward the street and a cop was just standing there all nonchalant as this dude cried into the lap of someone trying to comfort him I wish I knew what happened to him but when I tried looking it up there were no reports of anything and theyd just hosed off the sidewalk in the night for the morning tourists Its like it never happened Another time while walking home down Highland toward Santa Monica Blvd I saw a guy pull a gun on one of the hookers that hung around the area and he ran away when he saw me watching That hooker always said hi to me after that whenever Id see her on my night walks home Hollywood at night is a different city,pourthebubbly,16264934400,476
h6khy09,olspwd,I used to go jogging at 4 am nearly every morning as a teenager I lived in a relatively small town and usually stuck to my neighborhood so I felt relatively safe But as I got into better shape I decided to push myself and left my neighborhood crossing a road that turns into an interstate and jog around a strip mall before crossing back to go home As I was jogging around the strip mall I became convinced someone was following me It was an older man with a scraggly salt and pepper beard in an old junker of a maroon sedan maybe an old Monte Carlo I was super scared and booked it to a 24-hour diner across a couple parking lots in the big strip mall There were cops inside and at first naturally I thought I should go in and let them know I thought I was being stalked and needed help getting home safely (only maybe a 5 minute drive away) But I got embarrassed as a dumb teen and started second-guessing myself and also didnt want to be seen in public all gross and red and sweating from my long run so I just hung out outside the door until I felt Id waited long enough and the guy was gone I started jogging home and was feeling relieved I didnt bother the cops on their break as at first there was no sign of the car As I started running back across the interstate a car driving maybe 250 meters away screeched to a halt and flipped a bitch It was that maroon junker! I tried to run as fast as I could across the street There was a fire station at the top of a small hill and I thought if I ran fast enough I could make it But my legs were rubber from my long run and I couldnt push myself up that hill with any real speed and all that set in as I finally finished crossing the interstate I just dove into a fairly deep ditch on the side of the road and laid there facedown hands over my head eyes closed I heard a car pull over and heard someone pacing around and muttering above me I focused on trying not to breathe or move for what felt like several minutes but could have been only seconds I heard an angry exclamation and footsteps heading away a car door slam a car driving away I laid there for at least another 20 minutes I didnt know if I should go downhill back to the diner or uphill to the fire station I ended up doing neither I was afraid of being on either road at that point I ran across a small field where I needed to jump a fence into someones backyard and then jump the same fence to their front yard and then I was in my neighborhood again and ran downhill the couple blocks to my house That was the most terrifying experience of my life Ive never gone on an early morning jog since Its been over 20 years now,Delabeulah,16272919840,12

h5jy73r,olspwd,I go for two thirty minutes walks between the hours of 12 and 4 am every night and have for years I live in a decent UK suburb full of semi detached houses and old people Not the most dangerous place lmao But on one side there is a council estate and on the other a rather vast woodland These are where Ive had a few experiences One was a few months ago I was walking through a path in the woods leading back to my residential area in the dead of night It was completely black everywhere except for what was illuminated by my phone torch A person walked past me heading back into the woods wearing all black and a mask that covered his entire face It wasnt a normal mask youd see during the pandemic none of his face was visible at all I am 100% sure because I pointed my torch right at him He walked in an almost robotic manner and his head stayed straight without flinching at all Nothing happened to me but it was really odd Another was when I bumped into someone on a street corner in the council estate who had recently got out of jail for killing someone He beckoned me over to his group who were drinking I did because I have intense anxiety and didnt want to be seen ignoring him Turns out he was pretty sound though gave me a few cans of beer and was all round really nice and friendly Offered to sell me weed and I said no and left The scariest one was a few weeks ago This occurred on the main road that runs between my area and the council estate I joined up to the main road whilst smoking a joint and I saw a guy standing still on the street corner Normal but I did wonder what he was doing there at around 3am especially considering he wasnt even using his phone to anything just standing doing nothing Again Im awkward and anxious so I crossed to the other side of the road as to not have to walk directly past him Upon doing so I noticed he did the same following around 10 feet behind me I kept walking I then crossed back to the other side as to avoid him and I noticed he did the same again He was around 10 feet behind me this entire time matching my movements I crossed back over again and he also did the same Hed now followed 3 of my crosses which is what convinced me that it was beyond a coincidence I was definitely being followed The oddest part of it all is that I was getting faster the whole time By the end I was almost in a jog But he maintained the same distance In retrospect I assume he was just waiting for a drug dealer he was unfamiliar with and thought it was me Maybe he thought he was to follow me into a less public area I think this is more likely than him having sinister intentions Im sure Ive had some other scary things happen My memory is terrible I doubt this will get any attention but Ill try remember if it does My walks tonight are gonna hit different after reading this thread lol oh also side note none of this is fake or embellished You can check my profile I never answer these threads or tell any stories this is my first opportunity to write about an experience of mine lol Also fox noises are scarier than all of this combined Near enough shit my pants every time because their range of sounds is so huge and so human,cryforabsolution,16265544950,6

h5i9b93,olspwd,I was maybe 9 years old at the time but my two younger siblings myself and my mom were all walking back home from a baseball game featuring the local minor league team and we were walking past what looked like an an assault/shakedown in process This one woman who must have been no older than 25 years old was violently pressing another up to the side of a building with her forearm onto her clavicle or pressing her face first into the building with her forearm on the back of her neck or at worst pressing her up and threatening her with a knife Im pretty certain she was asking her where her money was All I know is she was being violently pushed up against the side of a building Of course as were all walking by my loudmouth sister asks my mom "Mom whats going on over there?" My mom being concerned for our safety and hers in case its not a personal affair and the woman turns her attention to us tells my sister "Nothing Keep walking" and we never talked about it again Honestly I think this is the first time Ive brought it up since Ive seen it happen all those years ago Even if my mom wanted to do the right thing and get the incident broken up it was at least 11:00 PM in a darkened area with few street lights not a lot of businesses that surrounded the area were opened or even opened to the public at that hour and cheap easily accessible cell phones werent even a thing yet I always wondered what happened after that incident,CaptainCool336,16265224470,4
h5k06y2,olspwd,My mom and I always took a lot of nighttime walks particularly so my mom could get away from my dad when he was gaslighting criticizing or screaming at her We were taking a family vacation in Palm Springs when I was 13 My dad was at it again with my mom so we decided to take a long walk late at night We were staying in a vacation condo complex more on the outskirts of town not exactly on a busy/well-lit city street For most of our walk I dont think there were even sidewalks or streetlamps so it was already kind of creepy We didnt pass any public businesses just a lot more condo/apartment complexes Finally we passed one of those apartment complexes that has the doors to each apartment on the outside with outdoor staircases and hallways There was a person (I remember it as a red-haired woman but my mom remembers it as a man) lying facedown and completely still in the concrete walkway between staircases right under the light as if in a spotlight My mom turned us around to go back then I watched the facedown figure till we were out of sight and I never saw them twitch I whispered "Was that person okay?" and my mom said "I dont know but were not hanging around to get involved" The rest of the dark walk back to the condos was probably the longest of my life; it was like I had newly realized that being out walking late at night wasnt safe and my hair stood on end the few times another person walked by on the other side of the road The condo didnt feel super safe either with my dad snarling at my mom (to answer your question he was mad at her because she was sad that hed cheated on her) but at least we were inside Tl;dr: My mom and I saw a person who may or may not have been dead during a late-night walk in California,EdgeOfCharm,16265555160,3
h5ii4iu,olspwd,When I first moved to Tokyo from another city less exciting big city in Japan I really wanted to walk around as much as the city as I could Since I worked from noon to 9 night time was pretty much the only time Id walk You can walk and drink alcohol outside in Japan so Id get myself a can or two and just choose a direction to walk I was working in Shinjuku which if you ever see a movie or picture of Tokyo 9 times out or 10 its going to be Shinjuku (tall buildings millions of people walking and neon lights) There is an area called Kabuki-cho which is known as Tokyoa biggest red light districts Id been there many times as it also is just like any other nightlife area of Tokyo and had restaurants bars izakayas public restrooms etc I made my way north from Yasukuni-dori (most movies where characters drive through Tokyo and have the lights shining on them through a window is this street) which is the start of Kabuki-cho from the regular part of Shinjuku You know youre there as the signs for host and hostess bars start appearing and you get drunker and louder Japanese college kids having a night out Our tourists since theres some "must see" things in the area as well I continued north with plans to go to the closest station to take the train home which was Shin Okubo Tokyos Koreatown The lights and tall buildings eventually fade and theres a few one or two story Korean restaurants or bars Theres a small park and some residential areas not too far from the station I got to a well lit street along the train tracks and could see the station ahead of me but then I was able to make out the sound of men laughing Its normal to have people just out hanging out drinking and having a time outside especially this time of night Since I aas close to the station and still had a bit of drink left o decided to see if there was some open air bar or something Id discover It was easy to follow the laughter to this side street near the small park and I saw a bunch of nicely dressed men in their 20s all gathered on this street Ive seen enough Japanese shows / movies to guess they were yakuza or chinpira (low lvl yakuza or sometimes just wannabes) and I know just walking by them wouldnt cause any issue So I headed to walk by them assuming they were just listening to someones story and gathered around As I got almost right next to them I saw one guy fully clothed with just his pants unzipped and slightly down having sex with a hostess against this building I know Japan has fucked up porn but I didnt see any lights or crew My mind went to rape but only until I saw the hostess face If anything she looked like she was the one in charge and getting what she wanted I passed them without slowing down and I think maybe two people even bothered to look my way I made it up the street a bit more and looked back and saw the woman pulling down a different guys pants Only then did I finally realize I wasnt going to head to the police to report a rape Of course I dont have the full story but it seemed more degenerate than dangerous I lived in Tokyo for 10 years after this and never saw anything quite like that and I was in Kabuki cho often after finding a few favorite places to drink and eat with friends,TokesBruh,16265284640,3

h8dm7fm,olspwd,Once was walking with some friends during one of theyre siblings birthday parties they live in a ghetto ass neighborhood but we have never had any run ins with gang members or anything in the past so we would just walk to the local park when we were bored but one time when we were there a white Silverado drove over the curb into the park and so did another SUV but on the opposite side we were in one of those slide thingies where theres tubes and slides everywhere and we were just chilling inside of the tubes when we heard people getting out of the cars and start running toards the public restroom As soon as they went in there we started hearing gunshots everywhere Im pretty sure we ran into a gang shootout but all I heard was gunshots for about 2 and a half minutes which felt like hours When that stopped we heard the 2 cars take off with no intentions of following traffic laws We got out of the slides only to find like 4 dead bodies outside the restroom area they were all covered in blood and holes and one of them had part if their skull missing We had to carry one of my friends because he threw up and passed out but we booked it back to my friends house while crying because of what we just saw and witnessed,ray_-pist,16285729470,3
h5hcm7j,olspwd,A couple years ago a friend and I were taking a walk at night and we didnt realize there was a homeless looking man following us We didnt have a whole lot to worry about because it was in a public area and there were still some people out driving (this occurred at about midnight) We eventually stopped and were about to cross a street and we looked around and saw him just standing there (assuming he just stopped as well) holding a bag in his hands (possibly drugs or booze) Once we made eye contact with him the man started yelling at us to come towards him shouting "HEY! COME HERE!" He did so at least three times and at that point we ran off and saw a couple rocks flying past us which he threw whenever we ran but luckily they hit the wall shortly after we ran around the corner Luckily we didnt see him again that night and we definitely took a different route back home,tonitrualis,16264953670,2
h5hjwlg,olspwd,I was walking back home from a convenience store and there was a guy on his bike letting me pass because it was obvious he didnt want to seem like a creep When I began walking infront of him I swear I heard his bike wheels right behind me I was on a very public and busy residential road so I didnt have to check right away until I was going to turn onto a road that was far less busy But when I could practically feel the zipping of his wheels against my back I peaked behind me only to find him nowhere It was like he disappeared It was a long streach of road that had very few exits that were anyhwere near us he could have gone into the convenience store but I did not see his red bike on the bike rack It was very odd and it made me paranoid because I thought he was purposely trying to stay out of my sights so he could follow me home,ModeratelyAmateur,16265004040,2
h5hkf10,olspwd,In my case it was the scariest thing Ive heard My old apartments had basement units with a small private stoop/threshold area for each individual unit These were little open vestibules that were below grade I heard a couple having what I presumed was sex in this outdoor area as I was walking by on the public sidewalk Years later I heard about a rape case where a woman was dragged into a darkened area and assaulted against her will while members of the public were nearby unawares It always haunted me to think that someone might have been being assaulted as I walked by and could have been too scared to call out for help and that I just assumed that what Id heard was a consensual act (There really was no way to know) I couldnt see a thing and probably wouldnt have walked closer to investigate but if I suspected that a rape might be taking place I certainly could have called for help I just hope it was consensual but it certainly was odd and a bit haunting in hindsight,VanessaOkay,16265007830,2

h5iw84z,olspwd,Damn the scariest for me happened in broad daylight a guy was coasting around on a bike with a bandana around his neck near the train tracks in the area He went by me twice closer each time and then I saw him pull in to the train tracks I crossed the road and tracks to the other side of the main street and he came back out behind me I glanced back and saw that hed put a hoody on and pulled the bandana over his face and was still biking slowly up behind me I picked up my pace and walked out into the main street to gather some attention and started going towards a public building he pulled back around and dropped the hood + bandana and biked off down the tracks Not sure at all what he was trying to do tbh thought he as going to try and rob me,LobieFolf,16265359560,2
h5j5zgk,olspwd,Once i was going for a walk and it was fairly dark out i went onto this path through the woods from a residential area leading to a beach where the path is slightly lit up At the beginning of the path just at the edge of the forest there was a woman standing smoking a cigarette I didnt think much of it and walked past her I was wearing noise-cancelling headphones so i couldnt hear anything around me unless it was pretty loud but i got this really bad gut feeling so i looked over my shoulder and saw her walking after me When you get to the beach there is a public restroom since i felt uneasy about this woman i went in there and waited for a few minutes until she wouldve passed if she was in fact not following me I grabbed the lighter in my pocket just so i could maybe flick it in her face to scare her if she was standing outside waiting to jump me or something (not that i would like set fire to her obviously but it was the best and only thing i could think of for self defence and maybe buy myself some time to get a headstart on a sprint) i walked out and i didnt see her right away I turned left to walk towards a pier and looked back a little and i saw her just as she noticed me too and she started moving the same direction as me immediatley when she saw which way i was going as if to make it seem like she had been moving in that direction the whole time if that makes sense Shes pretty close behind me so i stop to light a cigarette in hopes that shes going to pass by me and i can turn and walk the other way She kinda slows down so when i start walking again shes practically walking right beside me so i sit down on the first bench i pass by I can immedialtley see the look of "what do i do now" on her face as shes doesnt seem to want to go past me She walks a few metres further down the path and stops in the area between two of the lights that light up the path where its pretty dark and she has lit another cigarette at one point because she was always holding a lit cigarette I cant decide if the best thing to do is go up to her and just straight up ask what shes doing (for all i know she could ve in trouble and is scared to ask me for help im bigger than her and im a trans guy but in the dark i could pass as a cis male as long as i dont speak because im not on hormone treatment yet) or walk the other way to see if i might be overthinking and she isnt following me at all and if she still followed me as i walked back the other way i would know for sure Two guys walked past and i picked up the courage to tell them what was going on and ask them to walk with them to the pier so i could get past the lady because i doubt she would follow all three of us and sure enough she didnt When we walked past her she seemed like she was dissappointed and frustrated but not in a scared way per say When we reached the pier i thanked the guys for letting me walk with them and i called up my dad to have someone on the line just in case it seemed like a bad idea to call when she was around in case she thought i was calling the police or something so i tried my best to think on my feet I still wonder to this day what it was that that lady wanted,isaacgjn,16265405680,2
h5h4buh,olspwd,I used to walk back from work late at night/very early in the morning I have experienced: - a former childhood classmate take a huge swing at me out of nowhere as I walked along a dark street I saw it coming and it didnt connect That guy was always troubled and ended up committing suicide further down the line David I forgive you - a guy high on drugs who babbled completely unintelligible gibberish and followed me through a public park until I turned a corner and then SPRINTED away jumping through peoples gardens until I reached the house of a friend I knew would still be awake at that time - at the bottom of a hill in that same public park I heard the distant sound of running feet I looked back and at the crest of the hill I saw a guy running into some thick bushes and shrubs that led to the side of a dual carriageway and not emerge again even after I watched for several minutes I wonder to this day who he was what he was doing in there and why he was in such a rush to get there,MagicSPA,16264904090,1

h5hbpha,olspwd,It wasnt something I saw but something I smelled I was running on an off-trail in some undeveloped land between industrial commercial and residential zones Its fun to run there because no one else does but I could see that people would come through the area because of the trash theyd leave behind Anyways one night I decided to run on this off-trail because it was a fairly bright night and I didnt run those trails after dark very often so it was a way of keeping things interesting I was running further and further away from any roads houses or buildings and the trail was becoming darker because the trees were getting taller and denser and blocking the moon and city lights By this point I was pretty much in my "running zone" and just focused on breathing and moving when I hit what felt like a dense fog Immediately the stench of death hit my nose and it was overwhelming Ive come across plenty of animal carcasses throughout the years and this was unlike that An animal carcass scent doesnt surprise you out of nowhere On a night with no wind the odor will permeate out from the corpse and its something youll notice well in advance before completely dominating all other scents around it Needless to say I did not stick around to investigate any further and immediately turned around and ran back out onto more public property I came back less than 24 hours later during the daytime to find out what that smell was but it had completely vanished I walked even further down the trail than I had the night before to try and track down the smell I moved out of that neighborhood a few years later and read an article about how a body had been found in the same woods I used to run in It wasnt related in any way to the smell I encountered because of the difference in time frames but I always wondered if maybe I had come across a failed hiding spot that someone decided wasnt private enough,Procrastanaseum,16264947880,1

h5hfwh5,olspwd,So when I was 14 I had a crazy obsession with the Slender Man Like I wanted to fuck him This is what I wrote on my DeviantArt page back in 2013: "OH MY GOD IM GONNA DIE IN THE BEST WAY EVER So I just had a really freaky experience and I hope it was my imagination But at the same time I want it to happen again Heres the story: Ive been at my grandmas house for the past 2 days She lives in a fairly wooded area with only a few houses around her Theres this asphalt road that is right next to a creepy looking forest and its usually pretty deserted So of course being the loner I am I walked down the road alone at 7:30 PM like 10 minutes ago The road ends abruptly at a col-de-sac (SP?) where theres a few houses and a lake So I was walking down the road with a towel and I saw some deer and it was cool until I had to turn around and come back After like 10 yards of walking back I see a deer at the edge of the road We gave each other the death stare for a while until I backed away o show I meant no harm It then looked off into the forest in front of it turned around and ran I thought that was pretty weird and of course the main thought in my head was: "I wonder if I get to see Slendy!!!" but I kept walking A little after that I looked into the trees Since it was dusk everything had sort of a grayish tint to it But something seemed off color in the woods There was something darker next to a pine tree I looked really hard then realized what it was It had no face and was wearing a suit SLENDY! I flipped my chiz I turned around and jogged back to the col-de-sac Here was my mind: "OH MY GOD ITS SLENDY WHAT DO I DO I CANT JUST WALK PAST HIM HELL KILL ME HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET HOME?????" Eventually I walked slowly past where he was and saw nobody there The blackish tint was gone and all that remained was a boring gray But I began to hear footsteps behind me I didnt dare turn around and quickened my pace Eventually I broke out into a run the footsteps still behind me I ran back to my grandmas house then got some ice cream and hid in the closet with my laptop" So this actually happened but looking back it was probably a tree My grandparents live in a heavily wooded retirement community where the most dangerous thing is old Republicans with shotguns Honestly I needed an excuse to share this because it makes me cringe so hard,TheBedfordReader,16264975390,1

gy2nj9r,nc0yya,Peru was interesting I wasnt expecting so many large and ornate cathedrals but it made perfect sense in retrospect The Spanish colonized Peru and thats the sort of thing the Spanish built big churches The history of some of these churches was pretty interesting too-- I got to go down below one of them where there are some old catacombs full of bones When the Spanish first conquered the region they built churches directly over several sites where the Inca buried their dead and to be buried under the church was highly desirable I saw hundreds of human skeletons down there arranged in different ways Rows of skulls rows of femurs finger bones everything grouped together by body-part Lima was also a crazy city Parts of it look just like any large city with tall office buildings shopping malls heavy traffic-- but then just a short bus-ride away theres a stone pyramid being excavated I also liked how much public space there was and how many people were lined up in the parks with paints and easels and canvases selling their art That was fun to see If you go there you should try the ceviche The ceviche was excellent Some neighborhoods looked pretty favela-like but less crowded and pretty clean The roofs on all the houses are also flat there because it never rains in Lima pretty much ever Its sort of on the edge of the Atacama Desert one of the driest places in the world The only precipitation the city gets comes from ocean fog from the coast and they get all their water from the mountains I guess the Andes must produce an extreme EXTREME rain-shadow effect It rains so little the streets dont even have gutters or drains Theres just a shallow depression near the curb that the trash gets swept into The Sacred Valley in Peru was one of the most beautiful places Ive ever been and has some of the steepest cliffs Ive ever seen And yet at the top of some of these cliffs you can see some old stone granaries that the Incas built with no mortar to store their harvest,Taman_Should,16209758830,18

Propaganda The reason COVID isnt over and done with globally? Propaganda The reason the vast global working class cant seem to see that their political parties are bought out and working against them? Propaganda I could go on but the basic point is this: hardly anybody knows who Bernays was (a fact he was proud of and got off on) but he has **profoundly** affected your life; if you grew up after Bernays youve *never* not been propagandized and never *not* had your worldview grossly distorted by it Im sure someone else might eventually have picked up on the things that Bernays figured out and run with it but Bernays basically gave the US Govt a manual on how to get people to act against their own best interests - and those fuckers have had nearly 100 years to build on and perfect his research Anyway heres a doc on Bernays and what he did to us: [The Century of the Self Pt1: Happiness Machines](https://youtube/DnPmg0R1M04) [The Century of the Self Pt 2: The Engineering of Consent](https://youtube/fEsPOt8MG7E) [The Century of the Self Pt 3: There Is a Policeman Inside All Our Heads; He Must Be Destroyed](https://youtube/ub2LB2MaGoM) [The Century of the Self Pt 4: Eight People Sipping Wine in Kettering](https://youtube/VouaAz5mQAs),re_trace,16286116530,283

hszymtp,s5m4up,The controversy is birds Pigeons to be exact There used to be a really shitty bar in the middle of town The bar was in a row of older buildings that were all connected The bar and its owner kept causing issues with the other shops/the resturaunt it shared walls with and was frequently in trouble with the town for various violations including serving minors Well the bar was finally shut down and no one was very upset about it The bar owner however left a terrible parting gift The back door to the bar was a shitty looking but very sturdy wooden door with a frame on top that was supposed to have glass for a window Someone busted the window out and the owner refused to replace it When the bar shut down he didnt board the window but installed cameras on the door and locked it up tight He then fucked off and left no contact information Well we have a lot of pigeons And seeing an opportunity the pigeons flew into the window and got into the bar But they couldnt get back out because the window was in a stairwell that lead up into the bar itself Unless the pigeons flew down the stairs and back out the window they were now trapped As pigeons are not the most intelligent bird species hundreds of pigeons flew into the window very few came back out The businesses that shared walls with the old bar called the city repeatedly because pigeons were getting into the bar getting stuck and starving to death They wanted to save the living birds and remove the dead ones due to the smell The town officials however said the only person that could enter was the bar owner and since he left no contact info too bad so sad The fire department stated the mayor was aware and handling the situation so they could not breach the door The non emergency police line said they didnt handle wildlife enforcement the fire department did So they could not breach the door Wild life rescues were willing to house the birds but without the owners permission to enter they could not legally go get the surviving birds The town building and mayor stated that since the building was still owned they could not legally enter the building until the owner gave permission But the owner was not contactable And thus the circle of phone calls continued and no progress was made For the next several months the entire town rallied against the mayor and his officials to try and save these birds who would flock to the windows of the bar when they saw people and desperately peck at the glass for freedom The fire department police department town building local rescues and anyone else that could be called was called And every call lead to the same answer: you cannot legally enter without the owners permission People kept attempting to break into the bar to save the birds but couldnt breach the door and its security cameras The police kept warning that charges would be pressed for anyone who successfully got into the bar After MONTHS of this the mayor caved and allowed a crew to go in and remove the birds Except by now almost all of them were dead and decaying There were HUNDREDS of dead pigeons rotting in the bar They were piled against windows laying across the floor stuck in sinks and cabinets etc The smell was so strong you could be on the sidewalk and get sucker punched by the stench of rot and death There were so many flies they blacked out most of the street facing windows In the end there were very few surviving pigeons While they could eat the dead ones they didnt have a water source The amount of dead birds bird shit and flies were deemed a serious health hazard and the entire bar now has to be completely gutted The fire department was reprimanded for failing to intervene since they are the ones that enforce safety and housing codes which would include wild life infesting a building But the fire department has shot back stating that they didnt act because the mayor didnt want them to So its been a public shit show of finger pointing to pin the blame and the town is furious that these birds were left to die the way they were The building has been vandalized repeatedly and the mayor has been designated the Pigeon Murderer,RealAbstractSquidII,16423935770,55

hszgspk,s5m4up,School board has announced a public meeting to discuss switching from 5-day to 4-day per week school there is already one "teacher work day" per month (either a Friday or a Monday connected to a holiday) where there is no school Rich parents think its going to lower property taxes --- it will not because the school board will just find another place to spend the money (like the fancy baseball stadium and sports complex lighting they just added) Poor parents think its going to break them to have to arrange child care for 3-4 additional days per month -- it likely willthere is no infrastructure for it Grandparents are worried that 40% of the school kids qualify for free or reduced lunches and that means that those kids will miss two meals per day for 3-4 days more per month The "buddy pack" weekend food bank program is not prepared to add an additional days worth of food for the kids receiving the backpacks Students think theyll get 3-4 more days a month to play --- theyll really have 3-4 weeks per month where learning is squeezed into less classroom time and there will be fewer class-units per semester so fewer electives for the high schoolers Teachers know theyll get screwed either way --- just because the kids arent in the classroom doesnt mean the administration wont require them to be in classroom doing other tasks including deep-cleaning their own classrooms to prohibit the spread of covid The same classroom where they are legally prevented from enforcing a mask mandate The lunch ladies dont give a shit because theyve already contracted out feeding the kids and none of the food is prepared locally --- just dished out by increasingly bitter part-time-working retirees The bus drivers are the only ones who will "win" except theyll have to pick up another side gig to off set the loss of 6 hours of minimum wage work per week The good news? Both faith-based schools in town have announced that they will continue to schedule all classes 5 days per week and our state legislature wont let go of opportunities to vote in school vouchers that will take money from public schools and give it to the faith-based private schools Prior to this debate/debacle and covid the school districts standardized test scores were higher for a five-year average than theyve ever been ---- kids were actually being educated and going to college and trade schools instead of McDs or the factory I guess they figured it was time to dumb-down the populace again and start with the next generation of voters,Lybychick,16423856160,28

hszsyty,s5m4up,I grew up in a small town of about 1500 people I left there about 16 years ago so its not a CURRENT local controversy but it is definitely one of the most defining stories of my small towndespite happening about 25 years ago there are still reminders of this event at the local hockey arena AND high school So in any small town there are always a few families that are the "untouchable" ones They run local businesses one member or another of their family is usually the mayor they are your typical pillars of the community In our town there were three of them (the Smiths Joneses and Wilsons - not their real names but going to keep the names generic) Keeping the whole family background out of it suffice it to say that these families were all very tight with one another Going back three generations they had been friends farmed right next to one another went to church together got together on weekends to watch football They all had kids around the same age and those kids went to school together played football and hockey together and were best friends just like daddy and granddaddy before them Then the event You see around the time this happened our town was smack dab in the middle of a massive oil boom Every male in our community over the age of 18 worked in the oilfield in some capacityand I mean Every Single One And that included the young men of the Smith Jones and Wilson families These particular young men worked for an oilfield service company and their job was to drive around to an assigned set of wells on a daily basis make sure they were all operating properly; and if they werent fix them They all had their wells they went to check and that was that Well one day Smith is out checking a well; and seeing an opportunity for both him and Jones to get home to their wives and kids earlier that day he calls up Jones and proposes that they switch the last well of the day Smith was closer to Jones well and Jones was closer to Smiths Makes sense right? Why would they not do this Jones wholeheartedly agrees to switch wells and thanks Smith for letting him know this brilliant idea to shave 20 minutes off each of their work days So off they went Smith went to the well that had been assigned to Jones saw that nothing was wrong and went on his merry way home Jones arriving at the well that had originally been assigned to Smith opened the door and was instantly engulfed by a cloud of H2S For those not aware H2S (or hydrogen sulfide) is a common gas created at oil wells In a high enough concentration it will kill a person almost immediately This was a small room with a door that had been sealed since the well was last checked Young Jones had no chance He died almost immediately When the story leaked to the town it was quickly discovered that the well change had been originally suggested by Smith In the eyes of Jones parents Smith was responsible for the untimely death of their son and they were not about to let it go The entire town quickly divided between Camp Smith and Fort Jones The more reasonable people understood it was a freak accident and it could have happened to anybody The more unreasonable wanted Smith investigated and potentially charged with murder Consistent badgering instigated by the Jones eventually caused Smith to have a mental breakdown Keeping in mind here that not only was he being accused as a murderer publicly while trying to go about his normal day but the person he was being accused of murdering just so happened to be his best friend of nearly 30 years who could blame him He attempted suicide and was eventually sent to a psychiatric facility for the better part of two years After leaving the psychiatric facility he ventured back to our town and was met in much the same way as he had been before Public sneers and accusations He attempted suicide again and barely made it through After that he turned to alcohol and eventually got so bad that his wife (a local school teacher) left town and took their kids Still the more hardcore people in town blamed Smith Until the second instalment of the event In the second act a new player was drug into the story Im unsure how but this was never discovered until years afterwards You see in addition to Smith and Jones the Wilson family also had a young son who worked for that same company doing the same job Several years after the event and thankfully after the Wilson son had left town (in his own walk of shamecompletely unrelated but still shameful) it was revealed that the last time that well had been checked before Jones died out there it had been checked by Wilson It was revealed for some reason that Wilson had left a valve open during his check at that well which had allowed the H2S to escape fill the room and eventually kill Jones Wilsons parents still lived in town and were essentially forced out His father owned an electrical contractor company and was bought out by his partner and told he wanted nothing to do with him His mother was the local hairdresser and all of her clients left her in very short order They left town under the auspices of "retiring to the city" and never came back And thats the story of my hometown The Wilsons are all gone now The Jones are still in town and are still considered the pillar of the community The vast majority of the Smiths have left I think there may be a cousin of the Smith in question still in town but thats about it To this day some 25 years later a small shrine still sits in the local hockey arena displaying the hockey jersey and some beloved hockey photos of the deceased Jones boy In the high school another shrine with the high school yearbook from 199x (whatever year the Jones boy graduated) permanently opened to the page with his profile on it On the other side of the fold somewhat ironically is the profile of the Smith boy Two smiling happy young men forever remember by one tragic eventall because they wanted to get home 20 minutes early,mydreamturnip,16423908860,5

ht0ky6q,s5m4up,Local government paid 50k to a non-profit organization to commission a statue in honor of this famous musician One of the founders of this non-profit organization was also a member of the local government and the biggest proponent of the statue Then a three month contest was held to choose the sculptor who would get to design the statue For some reason the contest was never publicly announced Of course the winner of the contest just so happened to be a friend of the founders of this non-profit Finally the public found out about these affairs and started a petition to stop this thing altogether It was too late though the statue had already been made and the money was gone Then came the big reveal and it was a shitstorm The majority of the towns people were disappointed many outraged The statue also looked different than the original plans - it incorporated bronze grey and gold colors and blinking RGB lights It also played music when people were close to it angering people who lived nearby Now because of the differences the widower of this musician sued the non-profit and forbid them to display the statue So a couple weeks later they built a wooden box around the statue Now a year has passed and the box and the statue were finally removed and placed in storage All this generated heaps of accusations and heated arguments between the opponents and proponents of the statue and also a considerable amount of fame/infamy for the town,Fr0hman,16424073060,4

hsz6sh9,s5m4up,Well I just learned the other day about a gross thing that happened with a family I know So I used to go to this church that has kinda turned itself into an almost mega church (its the biggest church in probably 100 mile radius) I left years ago because it was full of cliques and drama and I now go to a smaller one that I like much better However this church likes to keep a facade that everything on the inside is perfect which is why this juicy drama is kinda ironic to me Theres this family that goes (went?) there who was always SUPER weird Like theyd let their kid who was way too old to be acting like a hooligan just run around yelling and being obnoxious meanwhile the mom and dad would just sit there with this odd grin on their faces Like smiling as if everythings fine I know the mom has worked with the youth groups at the church which is also why this news is disturbing Turns out weird mom had been HAVING SEX WITH HER SON!! Apparently for a while now!! I dont know how it got out but honestly thats probably why the kid seemed to be a little off The whole family always had a strange vibe and my mom would never let me around them without her there lmao So yeah i dunno what "perfect church" did about it but chances are its a big hush hush type deal because they either sweep things under the rug or make you publicly announce them in front of everyone to admit that you did something wrong Glad i dont go there anymore,metathena1,16423813820,3

ht0n560,s5m4up,My hometown is currently in upheaval because the school board *FINALLY* had the stones to officially vote to censure the trustee that has been nothing but trouble for the past 4 years He repeatedly gave terrible evaluation scores to the (excellent) superintendent and refused to offer any explanation or feedback on his scores; he was always the lone dissenting vote when a faculty raise was voted on (a mere formality of a confirming vote because the raises are scheduled and WILL happen unless theres a serious reason for it to be delayed) again without ever explaining why; he constantly missed meetings with no notice and when pressed about it when he would finally show up would say it was "medical issues so you cant ask me any more about it;" and he was perpetually unprepared for meetings when he did attend as evidenced by his demonstrated inability to access the website where the agenda was shared with board members prior to each meeting and his irrelevant questions which would have been answered had he read the preparatory material Other board members had recommended censure to the previous chairman more than once The current chairman finally agreed after this board member was heard using foul language in a public school board meeting conducted over Zoom (which he defended by saying "what happened to my freedom of speech?") Prior to being censured the board privately urged him to resign making it clear that he would be publicly censured and asked to resign if he refused He refused On top of all that he showed up to meetings and professional trainings in old jeans a variety of Hawaiian shirts and always unshaven when the dress code was known to be Business Professional His seat is up for election this year He gave a very angry and entirely unapologetic interview to the local paper which was run as part of the article about his censure It was amazing,notyogrannysgrandkid,16424089560,3
ht0q5gx,s5m4up,Our town isnt small compared to most folks on here but there are less than 10000 of us Its found a bit north of a large and long highway that runs 300 miles through Virginia part of US Route 60 Most who live here make their living working with their hands farmers mechanics and the occasional businessman who trades the trek into Richmond for the cheap housing Currently there is a very prosperous logger who owns a good portion of undeveloped land throughout the county For a bit of scale on the size my house sat next to a portion of the logging land Some miles down the road was a road that divided this portion from the rest about 80 to 100 acres in total between our house and that road On the other side of that tiny road was another 800 acre stretch of land that he was planning on logging as well So all in all he had at about 900 acres ready to be logged quite possibly more as if stretched back into a part of the county unreachable by road and Im not keen on trespassing where everyone and there mother has a gun(The logging occurred when I was still in middle school so I dont have exact measurements take this with a grain of salt) He logged that land for a good while up until I was a junior in highschool I was a bit sad when it started being a kid and all If you drove by it on just the right night the moon would peak out just above and light up the edge Youd be greeted with this eerily beautiful view of nature I felt something deep for those small woods but its just trees and theyll be back one day when Im long gone Funnily enough accidents went down once they logged it so I guess I wasnt the only one whod been staring No one in town really minded the logging It was his property and he wasnt bothering no one What they were weary of was what would come after A lot of people were scared of new housing an influx of outsiders turning the quiet country into a loud suburb I never minded that idea though All those new people maybe some company would finally see reason to bring in broadband to the area And so people waited to see what would happen And waited And waited until it all just fell into the back of their minds Well imagine the shock when everyone in town gets the same thing in the mail that day A crisp white letter with bold red ink stamped by the local government I remember seeing and think it looked important as my dad went through the mail A few minutes later I heard a loud "What in the Sam Fuck" from the kitchen What was in the letter was a plan that called for the creation of a solar farm by a brand new LLC and an invitation to a public hearings that were to occur a few weeks before the project began Now for context on why people got a bit angry In 2019 the county came up with a long term plan for what the town would look like in two to three decades It included a list of objectives and what people should generally expect to happen Nowhere on there was there talk of the creation of a solar plant right next to peoples houses And this was no regular solar plant either Remember how there were over 900 acres of logged land Well 927 acres were to be used for the solar plant and this was already next to a 160 acre solar farmFor reference its recommended that plants never exceed 500 acres The logger and the LLC were also engaged in some very questionable behavior regarding zoning They knew that trying to rezone the property would most likely get rejected because of the size of the property So they instead applied for a Conditional-Use-Permit which would let them use the land however they see fit even if it did not comply with the current zoning ordinance A small part of it would also be built on a few acres of state park grounds disrupting wildlife and migration patterns During one of the hearings a ecologist came forward with findings on how that this would really fuck with the park and the animal population Most people who were upset werent upset because it was a solar plant but because it was a massive project that the company was trying to slip through the bureaucracy fast enough that no one wouldve known what was happening until it was too late The board of supervisors were also bought along with the promise that this farm would make the county a lot of money which somewhat shows because they granted the permit 5-0 It also doesnt look well that they never told the public until days before they happened So to the people of town it felt like the county and the company were conspiring against them Just so no one claims Im some far right extremist who thinks solar farms are secretly brain washing people or whatever I think solar farms are cool and a good way for clean energy,RandomHuman018,16424113230,3

ht23o1f,s5m4up,I live in a tiny town in New Jersey you know the one that has the highest property tax rate in the country This tiny town is run by a "full time" Mayor who works and lives out of DC literally every day that the Borough is open but the typical day to day is handled by the former mayor who got himself appointed to a handful of positions in the Borough while still the mayor and has set himself up nicely with an 80K/ year clerk position We also just watched as they reappointed a police officer that is one of the better ones weve seen (as compared to the sergeant that was essentially gifted a lieutenant promotion after not being able to pass the test himself and the detective whos married to a council member and thats on camera violating the home and civil rights of a different former council member) only to see them a week later say "Nope we didnt appoint you" and they appointed the former mayors son instead (someone that has been reported as problematic by a number of girls at the high school that he attended) This is also ignoring the entire year of failed OPMA compliance and gaslighting about it from both the mayor and their scummy solicitor I would have to say though that my personal favorite was when a member of council moved out of town something like 8 months before her term was up During a Zoom meeting mayor shared his screen showing an email from her where she stated that she was resigning because she was leaving town Another email further in stated that [the overpaid clerk] was arranging for a place for her in town She didnt stay but held her council seat until October when mayor and council force-fed us another "yes man" without a vote And that was after we were on them literally every month trying to get her replaced only to be told by the solicitor *every* time "We will not discuss the personal matters of a member of council" Its important to note that this particular council person was the head of the public safety committee and the pepper spray incident that occurred here was on her watch If anyone cares I recorded the council meetings for years and posted them so other residents could see them I barely scratched the surface of the nonsense going on here and the state doesnt want to do anything about it but these people are the worst http://wwwwoodlynnenet,ShenDraeg,16424390010,3
ht2t0g4,s5m4up,Letchworth Village The question is whether the local Towns golf course properties should have been sold to a private developer Because in my opinion we had the perfect opportunity And we missed out on it Google "Letchworth Village" for context And please bear with me as I wrote this I got more and more heated This might get a little tl;dr Some history: Letchworth was originally an institution for the mentally and physically disabled up until the late 1990s The residents were transferred to individual group homes including my special needs uncle one of the sweetest gentlest human beings I have ever known The new system turned out to be great for the residents This Letchworth property spans hundreds of acres between the two Towns and has been on each Towns tax rolls for 10+ years with no profitability There is a private golf course mismanaged I might add Not on purpose but in my opinion - private business manages stuff better Granted thats just an opinion But the fact is that the course loses money each year and several years ago the catering hall closed up shop In the mid to late 1990s Letchworth buildings were subsequently abandoned by New York State The Towns of Stony Point and Haverstraw bought the property and currently is divided pretty much down the middle between the Towns For the rest of this Ill only refer to Stony Points side of the property The many stone buildings on the property need asbestos remediation The estimate is approximately $5 million for remediation but its probably much more because many of the buildings are currently decrepit dangerous and uninhabitable Our Chamber of Commerce has worked with both Towns to look for a suitable developer FOR YEARS - an entity with a vision not just for the property but for a plan that would integrate nicely with our area Examples: Rocking Horse Ranch Great Wolf Lodge At one point Legoland was interested but we rejected it because the traffic would have sucked (12 million more cars per year was too much) Also: Were alongside the Hudson River and the potential for tourism is huge Thats not even counting West Point and Bear Mountain 20 minutes north and a top 5 NY tourist destination SoFINALLY - we find someone Self made millionaire Lives local with family Business is local Owns the largest # of cell phone franchised stores in the Northeast Has partners that also live local and not that race matters but the partners were of diverse cultures and all family-oriented persons In my estimation it was a perfect fit for this area The developer presented a detailed plan to the Town Board His vision was to fix the buildings that ran along the main Town highways demolish the rest run the golf course profitably and build a conference center for businesses to come for retreats from NYC (35 miles from us) In addition he and his group also presented a plan for partnership with a five star hotel to occupy/ build on a portion of the property: The Ritz Carlton Multiple meetings over 25 years Traffic studies Concessions and accommodations for the Towns Justice Court Outreach to community before during and after meetings to provide public input Id say about 70% of the Town maybe morewas on board Contract negotiated posted and discussed amongst more Board meetings Sale approved And then JUN 2021: A small local environmental group (that opposes everything that takes up more electricity than a Google LED light bulb) gathers petitions to recall the vote based on their claim that "the information negotiations and contract" were done in secret Which is absolute unmitigated bullshit They flat out lied Everything was 100% transparent legal and communicated via multiple local channels and avenues in person online and more JULY 2021: A local Lawyer mounts a challenge campaign to run for Town Supervisor The Lawyer and Environmental group team up AUG: Our Chamber of Commerce allows both Developer and opposition group to speak at subsequent Chamber meetings to give a fair voice to both The Developers meeting is open respectful and provided context as well as a plan for how to finance the plan The opposition group presented an alternate vision for the property but with no plan for how to pay for it Also an argument between the Environmental group and the Lawyer broke out at the end of the meeting SEP 2021: Recall vote approved for early November Group mobilizes to convince swing voters to turn down the sale door to door emails and social media overwhelm the local residents Polarization begins NOV 2021: Voters head to the ballots and shoot down the sale Developer expectedly becomes disenchanted all the work over the past 3 years was for nothing He diplomatically exits all future negotiations So now we have no idea whats going to happen to that property next It will likely sit there with nobody interested For years Thankfully the Town Supervisor got re-elected Oh and that environmental group? We havent heard a damn peep from them since Why? Because they had no plan to begin with Except for the word "no" Ill remember that when I pay my property taxes over the next few years Tl;dr: A small group dismantled a legal multi-year transparent and beneficial effort to sell a huge Town parcel one which would have helped to transform this region for decades to come Were now back at square one Thanks,rocklandweb,16424485700,3

hpl4748,rm3qcl,A lot of weird shit happened with my football teams over the years but the one that takes the cake was coming out to the field a couple hours prior to a game and the seniors were fucking around with one of their "friends" They managed to pull his pants and compression shorts completely off after they were pulled down slightly while screwing around and I remember just walking up out of the supply shed to this guy running around in shoulder pads and jersey and no pants whatsoever cupping his junk in a complete panic for a couple minutes The seniors of course found it funny as hell but I still remember the look on his face and think to myself how traumatizing that must have been Straight up sexual harassment in public Nothing ever came from it punishment wise nor did the coaches even find out I think,lmMrMeeseeksLookAtMe,16401979240,2
hpmb7rf,rm3qcl,I love replying late on these kind of super popular threads because I get to have a little bit of catharsis in a group and yet - no one will see my contribution and kill my inbox Mid 80s 2nd grade school teacher "Mrs K" had my sister 10 years before me as a student In that 10 years my mom had also remarried (my sister and I have different last names) and had me Lets say my sister is Lucy Smith and Im Sally Jones So we show up for "meet your teacher" and Mrs K recognizes my mom and sister and refuses to call my mom by ANYTHING but Mrs Smith My dad (who is right there) is like - "No its Jones now Same as me same as my daughter" Mrs K just shrugs "I dont believe in divorce" This was a public school Nothing I ever did for Mrs K was good enough Everything was compared to my sister "Lucy" She would often call on me in class "Sally Smith oh I mean JONES" and it was so weird Towards the end of the school year chicken pox ran through the student population - there was no vaccine for it then - and I KNEW I had it I was feverish and itchy I begged Mrs K to let me see the school nurse She said no Her reason? "You just saw me send Billy to the nurse and I know youre *just like your mother* and cant wait to be alone with a boy so NO you cant go You can WAIT" So I did She never let me go I couldnt stop itching the SPOT where it itched (I mean come on 2nd grade) and still have a scar near my eye from it I didnt realize what she meant by "just like my mother" meant until way later,mckenner1122,16402158090,2
hpmg68t,rm3qcl,I had an awful friend group in hs because they were the best of the worst of public school Man the gaslighting the sexual harassment the rascism! And you were ridiculed if you said it was messed up It was super hard to acknowledge a toxic friend group with an already abusive home life Snapped out of that fog real fast when they joked about one of the actually raping an underage girl Not only one guy but his younger brother too In hindsight Pennywise the rapist could never keep his hands off of me and constantly joked about me being apart of his "kawaii anime girl harem" Crazy I EVER thought they were good people,ClaymoreClair,16402180890,2
hpmhb06,rm3qcl,Me and my friends printed out a cartoon that we doctored in mspaint that basically ripped on a girl for being fat It involved a cow and the pulp fiction tasty burger quote My friend slipped it into her book in class and when she saw it she cried and all her friends rightfully flipped out They retaliated by leaving a piece of paper in a public area of the school saying "Craig and John bum goats" so any punishment we would have got ended up being cancelled out by that Somehow they never suspected me so I escaped their bestiality insult I realised then that it was an awful thing to do and felt bad Trouble is young boys crave the laughter and validation of other boys and its easy to let a joke go too far When my son is older he will be getting a stern talking to about what is acceptable and whats not And I will tell him my own experiences and let him know I was an arsehole at times in hope he wont repeat it and make another kids life miserable,Ser_VimesGoT,16402186190,2

hsxc34b,rm3qcl,Im not sure why this has to be a friend I did plenty of terrible stuff Ok this one I was just talking about the other day with my buddy from the football team In New Jersey (I think) there is a lawsuit being publicized about hazing and it alleges sexual misconduct boys against boys We said well back in our day there were no sexual boundaries I immediately thought of the freshmen that were made to race around the track with cookies lodged in their anuses A cookie race Ok thats probably in here already Lets go really sick My home town was sick I peed on freshman in the shower Thats not OK Slightly off topic but the worst was no ones friend he was the coach of the wrestling team He would ridicule this one kid in particular The kid had cracked his head open and had staples in his skull and was practicing We were holding ourselves up in a pushup position for some minutes and the coach came and blasted the kid in the head with a basketball sending him writhing in agony Ah theres no many I shit in a urinal I had my female classmates reach into my pocket for a "present" when all I had for them was my pocket cut out and an erection pointing their way,Appropriate-Chest-79,16423554970,2

hpkaeg8,rm3qcl,Firstly this was 15 years ago and Ive grown in significant ways since then I want to get that out of the way before continuing because this is a pretty hotbutton topic and I know exactly how awful it is &#x200B; When I was a teenager in highschool I was friends with a lot of country boy types who did country boy things We would blow stuff up get high shoot guns (always with adult supervision) etc I remember the N-word being thrown around casually in this setting It was never calling a PoC that or even in reference to anyone It was used like a curse or just a general word for something bad At the time I dont think I really thought it was OK but because I was surrounded by white people who seemed to think it was I went along with it &#x200B; This was before a lot of the modern racial tension in the US but people were absolutely still aware of what that word means and the connotations of its use Im fortunate in that since highschool Ive made a lot of friends of various varieties and have been expending real energy toward getting rid of that casual racism that I grew up around I am a totally different person now because of this and continue to grow &#x200B; Mind you the families that I was around at the time were much more brazen about their racism I think this is a big part of why I didnt think what I was doing was all that bad because they were MUCH worse This is also why I find it hard to believe when people assure me that they arent racist Ive seen too many people that would say that publicly then say the most racist shit youve ever heard behind closed doors,ChoopAdoop,16401856940,1

hpkdvkl,rm3qcl,There was this kid who we didnt much care for who in turn would narc on us for anything he could which would make us hate him more We didnt go out of our way to bully him but when we did interact with him we had no problem being absolute assholes to him Coincidentally we all would go to the public library after school and we caught him watching gay porn a couple of times which gave us more fodder to make fun of him for Looking back on it I wonder if instead of treating him like a pervert could things have gone better if wed tried to talk to him?

hpke3jq,rm3qcl,In a class debate a guy made another girl cry and was left completely unchecked by the school or the teacher He told her that she deserves being abused by her family and that if they treated her wrong it was on her He yelled this at the top of his lungs and just walked away as if everything was normal That was completely fucked and Im am happy that he "peaked" in high school Even more fucked was a kid was recorded masturbating in the bathroom and it was sent to literally everyone on Snapchat and messenger In like 15 minutes it was public knowledge Props to the kid though As a freshman in High school he walked from the farthest point of school to the office with tears in his eyes and told the front office exactly what happened I still remember the principle coming on the announcements and the boys who took the videos getting suspended All this seemed to happen in a span of 30 minutes and from what I heard by the time that kid was a senior he kind of owned that he jerked it Maybe not fucked but definitely a whirlwind of an experience,GLDPineapple,16401872960,1

hpkkbwo,rm3qcl,When I was in the 3rd grade a friend of mine stood up from his desk and i was sitting next to him i held a pencil on the seat point up I guess I thought he would notice the overly cartoony gimmick and wed both laugh but he didnt sat on it and impaled himself Not deeply like he didnt need stitches it didnt penetrate him or anything but he did bleed It was the first time I was suspended for 3 days i wasnt allowed to see IMAX swimming with the dolphins And I had to wait at the office for my mom My mom was livid At the time I didnt understand why everyone was so upset It was an obvious joke that went wrong it happens Me and Mark were on good terms He was pissed at me for a few days more than fair but we more or less made up within the week I didnt *mean* to hurt him and yes I felt guilty I had but my mom was *known* at the school for being the strict one who wouldnt hesitate to scream at me in public I thought i was getting the worse deal As an adult and coincidentally reenforced this week because me and my partner got high and are hatebinging all of "13 Reasons Why" I realize I almost raped my friend with a pencil at 11 years old Also there was a special needs kid in my grade throughout like 6-9th grade I dont remember his name Matthew or something I never actually bullied him; I didnt like bullies and was usually the one to step in between a bully and the person being bullied when i saw it However i didnt really like Matthew and whatever his condition was he would get very easily flustered Hed turn red and make these overly exaggerated angry cartoon characters movements that I thought were funny but not like hysterical He had some kind of attachment to me he would often come up to me for one reason or another for my approval over something or to be like a "look at this" thing I used to call him a "sped" and a "spaz" I honestly didnt make the connection between "sped" and "special education" (this was public school) i thought it was just the word you used cuz my friends and everyone else called him a sped and a spaz I also would intentionally talk in circles around Matthew or be intentionally confusing and obstinate because he would get flustered and aggravated and i thought it was funny As an adult I wonder how my actions influenced his life I still feel bad about that,Voodoosoviet,16401899080,1
hpkoicy,rm3qcl,High-school acquaintance of mine ("Joe") approached our mid-year-replacement chemistry teacher semi-privately (but not so privately that a few of us seated closeby couldnt hear) explaining that he was currently ranked fifth in the graduating class that he was only fractions of a point ahead of "Betty" who held sixth place and would the teacher mind terribly keeping his grade at a perfect A so he could maintain that lead? Teacher seemed to agree at least publicly and whether due to hard work or favoritism "Joe" did indeed graduate fifth in our class Ive periodically wondered since then if perhaps "Joe" had a pre-existing deal with the prior chem teacher who had to leave mid-semester and whether he had similar "deals" with his/our other instructors "Betty" might well have had fuel for a lawsuit had this happened ten or fifteen years later,sskoog,16401916000,1

hpkqt7n,rm3qcl,There was a high school band teacher that was a major dick I mean the kind of guy that would announce his fiancs pregnancy only to tell everyone two weeks later that they decided to have it "sucked out" He loved to publicly humiliate people and as the adult in charge he was very good at it One day the guy who was supposed to play the trumpet solo at the homecoming game botched a part of the song I dont remember what it was a wrong note missed cue something but he made a mistake The teacher lost his shit and proceeded to scream at him in front of an entire stadium full of people He told him to go fuck himself threw his trumpet on the ground and walked off He never played the trumpet again That weekend someone came by the band room and shot out all the windows then went inside and just trashed his office We all knew who had done it but there was no proof All of us were weirdly proud of him for getting his revenge in such a manner but looking back it was probably not ok,Catzenpudl,16401925250,1
hpkqwaz,rm3qcl,I went to public school in a rural town of South Korea which was very monocultural In the fourth grade (2006) there was one black kid in my class (mom had an affair with a foreigner got kicked out of family when the baby turned out to be a different race baby got put up in an orphanage and grew up to attend the public schools so he looked very different but Korean is the only culture and language he knew) He was sort of on good terms with the classmates they relentlessly called him "blackie" () but he wasnt totally ostracized The teacher however would literally beat him bloody over the smallest things Didnt put his chair away properly? Doodled on his desk? Didnt hand in homework? He would get a stick or ruler and whack him until the kid was on the floor sobbing all the while yelling curse words and slurs at him At the time I would be a little happy about it because the kid would tease me a lot for being a girl and also the only other mixed race kid in the school (but I am half white so I was viewed as better) Now looking back I can see how incredibly fucked up and tragic his entire life was I wonder how hes doing now Korea has definitely gotten better with the way they treat people with foreign features especially in the city Hopefully he moved out of that rural nowhere town and could be happy,thanksyalll,16401925600,1

So you advertise as dog friendly but then tell your customers to tie their dogs up outside the property on the public sidewalk where the owner cant quickly get to them if something happens??? Just say you arent dog friendly and itd all be good! So thats my petty boycott that I still observe 6 years later,forman98,16270439910,431

h19ggaw,nwbbm3,Fun US law enforcement facts: Asset forfeiture steals over $5 billion a year from ordinary Americans (and the US economy) more than burglars take Its been this way since before the new century The precincts get to keep the assets seized (unless the original owners wend their way through the court system _and win_) The police use this stuff to not only buy party stuff but off-the-record surveillance gear I tend to say Law Enforcment kills about four people a day Only since the Ferguson Unrest in 2014 did it become public attention that the police murder a lot of people In fact the FBI is required to track _all_ police involved killings and report them to the BJS thanks to a congressional order from the 1980s They just dont Small private organizations track police involved killings from coroner reports news reports and obituaries but many of them are not reported by the officer who killed them (or any of their colleagues) Even now that news agencies are tracking police-involved killing not all of them are tracked and found especially if a victim is homeless or doesnt have known surviving family About 1200 a year are tracked ones reports are exchanged and cross-matched We only can estimate how many are lost between 600 and 1200 meaning that four a day (1461 a year) is actually generous Over half the homicides in the United States are not reported with a cause This arent TV murders where someone finds a body and a long investigation leads to a serial murderer (serial killers are super rare) Of _reported_ homicides two neighbors have a dispute one has a handgun and shoots the other guy in a drunken fit of rage (Drinking and guns _notoriously_ dont mix much like drinking and driving or operating any other dangerous machinery) If law enforcement better tracked who died and why we might actually be able to better eliminate circumstances in which people might shoot each other But they dont and we have to guess due to a tinier sample In fact if we count _only_ homicides with a reported cause and motive police-involved killings are really high ranking (domestic incidents and gang-related incidents are rather tiny numbering less than 200 typically) Again the police can change this by actually completing reports,Uriel-238,16233192910,9

h4e3mvs,nwbbm3,One of the reasons there are laws and statutes on the books preventing your employer from forcing you to work in hazardous conditions is because in the late 1920s young women in a town in New Jersey began dying from horrible agonizing illnesses that appeared to make no sense Early symptoms included exhaustion loose teeth joint problems wounds that wouldnt heal and agonizing pain in the face It inevitably escalated to the gradual dissolving of the bones in the jaw (one womans jawbone fell out entirely) then wasting away as other bones rotted inside of them and finally a painful death Doctors accused some of the women suffering of having contracted an STD It took YEARS of expensive legal work by the young women suffering from this mysterious illness to finally identify the source- during WWI they had all worked at the same factory that painted glow-in-the-dark dials for watches To work more efficiently they were instructed by supervisors to point their paintbrushes by sucking on the tip of them Known to the company but unknown to the women the radium that caused the paint to glow was dangerously radioactive Due to the unique properties of radiation it was especially deadly when ingested Not only was the company aware of this they had been covering up research on the dangerous properties of radiation and had even hired a fake doctor when women started getting sick to convince them they were suffering from syphilis While dozens of women were dying agonizing deaths their employers were not only actively covering up their complicity but continued to knowingly employ other women in the same dangerous conditions When exposed the company used legal loopholes to try to avoid paying for medical treatment for the dying women including stalling the courts in the hopes the women would die before a verdict was reached The case against the United States Radium Company was responsible for changing a lot of labor laws that protect workers from harm And after that no workers were ever put in danger again- Aha just kidding the exact same thing happened in two other states over the next decade with companies that used radium actively lying to their (working class female) employees about the dangers of radiation despite full knowledge they were killing them They didnt stop until public opinion turned against them and stringent legal statutes were put in place to protect workers Never forget that plenty of companies would gladly kill you if it meant protecting their bottom line,flyting1881,16256877140,3
h1aw613,nwbbm3,Years ago a foreign country unleashed a biological attack on the world The government censored any discussion around the actual potential origin of the attack When people started dying from the attack the government started inflating mortality rates to secure monetary grants per death and drive public hysteria When they found there were existing effective treatments available they censored those too in pursuit of a cure Any medical professionals who spoke out against it were silenced many stripped of their medical licence The governments ignored the impact of their mitigation tactics despite evidence from many other countries showing that what they were doing was ineffective Once a cure was deployed healthy people started experiencing adverse reactions those reports were censored too The government started pushing these cures although still in trial phases mandating them in many instances They started pushing them on children even though it was shown that children were largely unaffected by the bio-attack and that they did not transmit the attack Eventually those who did not accept the governments cure were either forced or were stripped of their civil liberties and forced to live in segregation from the rest of society,macsb,16233453180,21
h191mti,nwbbm3,In the area that I live we have an industrial strip with a series of differ plants which produce a range of different products from hydrofluoric acid too fertilizer a person I know has worked all around the strip in different companies He told me a story one day about how they handled the waste back in the 80s obviously waste from these plants is hazardous so they need to be dealt with carefully its apparent that they used to pump in out into our ocean through a main line disposal pipe which most of the major companies used well apparently the public caught wind about what was happening and it put the industry under pressure to find new ways to dispose the chemical waste so this is what they did Keep in mind this industry is quite close to a town and the public anyway they came up with this crazy idea to send a nuclear charge a certain depth underground to create and big bore hole in which they could pump waste into toxic flammable corrosive waste this just seems crazy to me if there is still big amounts of waste down there and it some how ignites it will cause chaos gas clouds massive explosions chemical fires Theres a LPG plant in the area aswell that could potentially explode this area is a 8 minute drive from my home,th3krackan,16233061130,4

Im just being honest with what I heard What serves the publics emotional interest better? Saying "Yeah we shot that plane down Its standard procedure in the given situation Sorry about your families" OR putting out a heroic story about the patriotic bravery and courage of a bunch of dead Americans who gave their lives to take those Muslim bastards out? You tell me Either way the people are dead and theres no fixing that but at least in one of those scenarios the American people dont get mad at the government for making a tough decision But dont forget that it IS standard protocol to shoot the plane down Thats not conspiracy; its known fact So in this situation what upside would there EVER be to admitting the plane was shot down? Seems like a PR no brainer to memorialize them as heroes Im not saying these passengers werent heroes either Im sure they DID fight back and nothing changes that reality But if neither handling of the post-crash situation changes the overall outcome which scenario is more palatable to the American people? 1 The Passengers Patriotic Suicide 2 The Government Shooting Them Down,tripn4days,16233008190,32

I do wonder if population density degrades social rules or just certain cultural priorities let these things devolve These kindnesses are standard Midwestern fare but also no one lives in the Midwest except for 5 people so being patient and self-controlled is easier/ less competition Asia is a whole different ball game and everyone is always full on body checking folks to get to the front of lines on buses subways or just on the sidewalk for reasons I havent understood yet Public spaces are physically competitive and Korean social dynamics are also hyper-competitive hence why its called "hell-Joseon" by Koreans Everyone is trapped in a competitive vice so social kindnesses are gone,Smokeyourboat,16260292000,2

All republicans are anti-vax evil!" says the blue people Medicine vaccines treatments they should never be political at all These are the things that can either keep you alive or make you dead Politicians dont give a damn whether you live or die so instead of showing loyalty to your party by getting medical treatment or vaccines you have to do it for yourself! - The politicization of the vaccine ended up destroying friendships and families This made me realize that people value political tribalism more than friends or family Why? Is it because its easier to get compliments praise and acceptance from more people if you show you belong to a certain political side online? This is very sad You should value your friends and family more than mere politics These politicians will tell you everything you want to hear but theyll never give you a second look once theyve gotten your vote and you try to hold them accountable for breaking their promises Friends and family will always be there for you You should really think about where you invest your love and loyalty in - Because of the virus people ended up using "ZOOM" to work online This means that your face is the focus of the camera and everybody sees you all the time Have you ever thought about shy people?

h8xqcxf,p47gki,Greed Almost everything else on this thread (climate change oceanic ecosystem collapse disease etc) has the means to fight it or the knowledge/ research techniques necessary to develop them "Green technology" has been around for decades I mean Jimmy Carter installed solar cells on the roof of the White House (which afaik Reagan took down) Sustainable agriculture plant based diets (as both a disease reducer and decreasing the need for water and land used for animal feed) and water recycling have been in vogue to small degrees since at least the 1950s So why arent these things more broadly adopted or known about? Greed Corporate interests dont want better ways of doing things because it threatens their bottom line Its simply cheaper to invest in propaganda (through political donations manipulating education materials paying for museums funding misleading documentaries failing to educate the public or advertise better products etc) than it is to invest in improving their products to be better and more efficient and sell them Public corporate law favors maximizing revenue on a quarterly basis - to do otherwise threatens the security of the company employees in the eyes of the shareholders From this perspective its best to make as much money as possible right now than to invest in a sustainable future because otherwise the job of the CEO and other execs becomes threatened Unless a powerful CEO can make a very strong case for it there is simply no financial or career incentive to invest in green technology There are a lot of factors threatening the planet and a lot of stupidity enabling it to continue But the thing preventing solutions from manifesting at scale is greed: desire for short-term profits above all else Plain and simple Greed is what will kill us all,hatchway,16289642640,2

h6trmqy,ot0pdk,Oh man I have some stories I used to work as a florist for a super high end flower shop in a very large North Texas city that only dealt with the richest of the rich I was the mobile field guy and our shop had contracts with some of the ultra wealthy to send someone by every other day to their houses to freshen up or change out fresh flowers in their foyers ballrooms bathrooms etc To give you an idea of the level of wealth we did with a certain owner of a certain North Texas NFL football team was on my weekly rotation as well as a certain NBA team owner and "shark" was a common stop too It was kind of cool you were almost always just a fly on the wall in the lives of the rich and famous Because I had to go to each house every 2-3 days it was easy to eavesdrop and chat and enjoy basically what amounted to a real life TLC reality show First thing I learned is that there is a **HUGE** difference between old money folks like the football team owner and new money folks like the basketball team owner Old money people are super fucking weird They dont talk to "the help" much and let their property managers or whomever deal with us but they are so used to having staff around they dont give a shit and you see and hear a lot Everything is super stuffy and pompous Everyone is so insanely obsessed with their social standing who knows who and who has the nicest this or that If one person on the block buys a new boat everyone else has to buy a slightly nicer boat or if someones wife in the neighborhood gets a new Porsche everybodys wife is getting a new Porsche I shit you not one time I was hired to do flowers for a BBQ at a rich guys house he had some neighborhood friends over I overheard some of the men arguing about what brand of luxury car one of the guys was going to get his wife because the others said once he did they would have to get one for their wives as well Most of them are all unhappy in their marriages and fucking each other in every manner Husbands hooking up with other wives wives hooking up with other husbands husbands hooking up with other husbands bored wives or kids home from school hooking up with staff members or people that came through to work in or on the house Staff members fucking each other Just eveybody fucking everybody Its super entertaining watching them all fight for social status and trying to act better than each other when in most cases theyve all probably snorted cocaine off each others asses and fucked within the last month The more pious and holy a man in those circles acts the more certain it is hes fucking teenage girls and the happier a woman claims to be in her marriage the more dirty damp and deep shes getting from every young pool guy and landscaper she fancies A lot of the time rich parents will "strongly suggest" by giving or withholding financial help in return for compliance from their sons and daughters to marry each other to either keep wealth within tight circles or uphold some bloodline or stupid shit like that So they will get married to whoever their parents want and then hook up with everybody else in the neighborhood They also abuse prescription drugs like nobodys business they pop Xanax like candy and cocaine use is rampant There is nothing like spending an hour trying to get some flowers done while some rich guys housewife hopped up on cocaine to try and get some relief from the boredom rants about her life for an hour Basically if you watch Schitts Creek the majority of old money people are like real life versions of the Rose family but with abundant access to cocaine xanax and viagra New money people are typically the opposite from old money people Most are super down to earth and treat you well and live pretty normal lives just with a lot more money Some are super snobby and douchey but most are really laid back and chill Like they have this attitude of fuck it I made it I never have to worry about anything again They tend not to air their dirty laundry in front of the staff and some but not all will chat with you The new money folks tend to be a lot more frugal though which is understandable But I liked working with them quite a bit more A lot of new money folks were focused much more on just enjoying being home and not working as much so a lot of them had really cool hobbies and its interesting to see how normal people who get rich spend their money One guy had an entire barn full of classic motorcycles Another had the biggest LEGO collection Ive ever seen anywhere including the Internet One had a massive home theater with a gigantic projector screen and every single video game console and probably every game ever made Most were really eager to talk about and share their hobbies which was nice New money people are always either happily married or divorced and in some stage of partying The happily married folks were usually pretty calm but the single and single folks had some wild events and scandalous drama that could compete Another complicating factor is that there is a very real and often physical degree of separation from most of the ultra wealthy and the rest of the world In the city where I worked the ultra wealthy lived in huge gated communities compromised of walled gated complexs with multiple houses and guest houses on each property where the HOA required yearly proof that you had a bank account with at least $500k in it These neighborhoods often have tall sturdy brick walls surrounding them with a few hundred feet of gardens around the interior just so you have as little chance of seeing or hearing the peasants outside as possible They have their own grocery stores their own clothing and department stores restaurants bars car dealerships hairdressers jeweler schools daycares dentists you name it All with the same formula to cater only to the rich for every need and desire of day to day life without ever having to interact with the general public They can go months or years without ever having to speak with or even be in the same room with someone from outside the upper class For this reason a lot of them are very extremely disconnected with the real world and sometimes its comical sometimes it was scary Like I would often get $100 tips not because they wanted to be nice but they genuinely thought that $100 was just the standard tip for things,drforrester-tvsfrank,16274780100,12
h6t2d62,ot0pdk,That rich people are probably a lot richer than the public realizes Like one of our clients was listed as being worth 900 mil and listed as a near billionaire but we were holding nearly half that That combined with my boss having a personal relationship with him confirmed that he was easily a billionaire even after he had given away tens of millions supporting local arts Kind of wild that so much money can go unseen On a smaller scale one of the guys that worked for him got some heat for blowing a million dollars entertaining some hollywood folks,atetuna,16274592830,5

h7a0shs,ot0pdk,I dont exactly cater to them but my great uncle and aunt are fucking loaded They have two IDENTICAL houses in different parts of Toronto which is already a stupidly expensive area to buy a closet in and not only did they buy the houses they were *custom built* When we told them we were looking for a house to rent at the beginning of Covid they were just like here take this house and let us live in the second house for free The house especially stood out because it had been built right next to a bunch of normal sized houses It was by no means a mansion they had a limited space after all but it was much taller then the others around is and wider too Inside all the furniture was white which made my mother super paranoid and she immediately covered them so we wouldnt ruin it The kitchen table had a glass top and the floors where made of very dark wood which always showed even the slightest amount of dirt on them and we were constantly sweeping It was also filled with the strangest decor A huge neon framed image of Marilyn Monroe in the same room as bleach white couches and glass tables with futuristic metal candle holders Metal table decorations that looked like maces and one like a dick There were so many windows too The dining room had windows all along two of the walls that went from floor to ceiling My room had three floor to ceiling windows as well with no curtains overlooking a street so the first thing we did was slap curtains on that I also had a square walk in closet so that was an interesting experience my clothes didnt even take up half the closet I ended up moving to a new school and when my classmates found out where I was living they all got super excited and kept asking what was inside They had all watched it while getting built and then watch it be empty for *two fucking years* before we came along One of my great uncles kids asked us how we were enjoying the "party house" while we lived there There was multiple sets of furniture stored away too When we arrived I was showed to an area filled with different bed cover sets and told I could pick whichever one I liked There was never a piece of furniture we couldnt find None of the rooms had lamps in them so after a small expedition we found enough lamps to light the whole house with just lamps There were so many miscellaneous items in that storage space to decorate with I will never forget the wall of just decorative pillows They also have a third house in Lebanon that has so many floors they need an elevator to go around the house It has multiple living rooms and multiple formal sitting rooms There are two kitchens on different floors and more balconies then I can count One of the dining rooms that was only ever used once in our entire stay with them at the Lebanon house had these pillars surrounding the table that were really thick with flat reflective glass on the table facing ends that where filled with china and glass sculptures They also had a spiraling staircase that was used to traverse the three main floors and get up to the attic It was this stone marble-y thing that was very slippery if you had socks on and there was absolutely no railing It was just a drop off I feared falling to my doom every time I used those stairs When we went to Lebanon we also got to meet some of our cousins (I didnt bother asking how in the world we are related at some point you just accept that maybe everyone in the middle east is your relative) They also had a multiple story house and happened to have three young children One was four one fourteen and one sixteen They had two nannies and the kids had these little remote things that could call the nannies for them like a bell but digital A lot of the nights the adults where out and the kids would all be left together with the nannies at the cousins house The fourteen year old had a wall that was just a bookcase and he admitted to me he hadnt read over 3/4 of them He had so many books I was dying to own and didnt even know the plot of them He had a play room that wasnt like just a play room it was *his* playroom and it had a huge tv that he played Fifa on All three boys went to private school obviously and were surprised my siblings and I attended public school The fourteen year old was planning on going to a football summer camp that cost more then our trip there The family hosted a dinner party once where they took us out to dinner and then had a second dinner at their home They had this huge tray of sushi except Im not sure they knew exactly what sushi was because it seems they knew the gist and guessed from there It was wrapped in seaweed but the inside was like no other sushi Ive had before It was disgusting but maybe its a rich person thing Most of it was thrown away Seeing all the excess in Lebanon made me really sad honestly All if it was so pointless Anyways that kinda got off topic but yeah it always amazes me how they live and how money is never a barrier for anything for them Oh yeah and they have Picasso paintings in the house they live in I cant believe I forgot that My brother commented on the nice painting they had hanging on the wall in the front hall and my great Aunt just casually goes oh yes its Picasso,Psychology-onion-300,16277906980,7
h6tk7x4,ot0pdk,Hey a question that Im well suited to answer! I catered in NYC for the past 4ish years Ive been on the upper west side in apartments where the family bought out three floors upper east side serving cocktails next to a picasso (and others that I cant remember) I was the shadow to the mother of the bride for a wedding in the NY Public Library at Bryant Park and joined the wedding party alone in the completely empty "stacks" after hours for photographs I catered a wedding and other events at the MOMA (Museum of Modern Art) and wheeled carts through the vast hallways underneath the museum Most memorable moments include when I catered an event for attorneys and while serving hors doeuvres (had to look up spelling) a man put both his hands through my hair and yell to his friend "Hey! Look at this!! This guys got great hair!" He was hammered and sloppy as shit I didnt enjoy that Another one was when a little jewish boy had his bar mitzvah at a club Literally a club like Marquee They got this kid a rapper to come perform and the rapper had the crowd chant "Leave me alone! Leave me alone!" That was the name of his hit single but god was it funny watching a bunch of rich white people chant that back to him Sorry for the formatting Im on mobile Theres definitely more but Im in a bit of a rush so if anyone has specific questions Id be happy to answer them Although Im more inclined to want to talk about my accomplishments as an actor since thats the only I reason I ever catered in the first place!,dbonx,16274738000,4

h6tg466,ot0pdk,I dated a heiress to a few tens of million s around 20 years ago Her Daddy owned a series of hotels and would pay off her credit card each month no matter the balance He was actually a really nice guy who had worked hard for his money She would pay for everything on the credit card including all of our date expenses The other thing I remember about her was she was absolutely filthy in bed nothing was taboo Unfortunately she was also incredibly entitled and the concept of money just escaped her She would never look at the costs of anything and had no concept if she was getting a good deal or not If she wanted a car she would just go buy it She often bought things that would never be used I remember that she worked in one of the hotels in a token role as manager - but this was only when she was in the mood and as she was the owners daughter the other employees had to deal with it We broke up because we were due to go to her friends wedding together However the weekend before my Grandmother died and the funeral was the same day She told me I was selfish for choosing to go to the funeral over the wedding I looked her up a few years ago She now has three children by three different men Also involved in a public scandal with a local politician Shes still entitled and rich It was a wild 2 months and as a young man I did enjoy the ride (literally and figuratively) I do sometimes wonder what if But even then could see the cluster fuck she was and am not surprised she ended up the way she did,ConsciouslyIncomplet,16274710490,3

h6tur3v,ot0pdk,I have noticed that being wealthy does not lead to happiness Fundamentally people are generally as happy as they are going to be unless they work on their self awareness as a part of their physical mental and emotional health habits The super wealthy have countless ways to distract them from discomfort and if they arent mentally physically and emotionally healthy prior to becoming wealthy they sort of just distract themselves with their wealth By contrast those who are healthy are incredibly down to earth and consistently greatful for their circumstances This winds up having little bearing on their politics Taxes and government interference with their projects is what ultimately drives their political inclinations That being said there is a certain segment of the ultra wealthy that really lean into the "self-made" mythos but those folks typically bootstrapped their own businesses and are just insecure enough to be unwilling to acknowledge how opportunity played a part in their success because they are hyper aware of how much effort it took to prepare for the opportunity before it arrived Those folks be Republicans and Libertarians for sure,tomowudi,16274795780,3

It didnt make me feel good at all But Im a guy right? They certainly didnt feel any issie with grabbing my ass several times that night and making sexuality inappropriate comments toward me In a way Im kinda glad it happened because it removed that toxic behavior from me when I was still a teenager because I will always remember how it made me feel I dont know how the female staff put up with any of it But one story that really showed a lack of care toward anybody was one women who substituted as a teacher for the school district Seeing how this was the same area I remember her at least twice growing up being our sub for the day in middle school She would come in almost everyday at about 9am when the club bar opened She would drink ALL day Moving from the club bar to the dining room bar at some point before leaving in the late evening None of the bartenders ever thought twice about cutting her off because her husband was an influential member at the club and lead several important committees Nobody wanted to lose their job Til one day she crashed her car into a telephone pole No charges filed or sobriety check done The local cops around there are all in bed with other members and give politically toward publicly held police positions and causes/charities Husband buys her a new car and she crashes that one before the temporary tag is even expired on it This one she get DUI for because it was a state police officer that catches that case She temporarily loses her license that time but thats no problem husband rents her a car under his name and she drives it to the club as normal Working there showed me clearly that the rich really dont give a shit about anything or anybody,JesusWuta40oz,16274750690,1

Where are the exits? Whos here that I can see/hear? Who could be here that I *cant* see/hear? Of the people you can detect what are they doing? Does your presence grab their attention? Make these observations calmly nonchalantly Dont draw attention to the fact that youre sizing up your surroundings When in new areas do everything you can to appear as if youre a native to the area Especially when traveling Dont let yourself seem like youre lost unsure of where youre going or new to the area Dont gesture at the buildings around you dont stop in the middle of pedestrian traffic to ogle the sites dont stop to consult maps in public if you can help it Try to keep your gaze at eye level as if youve seen this area many times Dont dress like a tourist Make it seem like youre familiar with the area and know exactly where youre going Those who stick out will be targeted by exploiters or worse Ideally you want to embody the concept of a "Gray Man" someone so bland and assuming as to be forgettable Dont wear flashy clothing/accessories that can either indicate wealth or draw attention from its design Dont wear clothing unusual to the area Dont wear backpacks that indicate you could be a tourist and/or that you are carrying expensive equipment and/or personal items Dress in bland dull colored clothing that either appears cheap or *is* cheap and that lack any designs or markings Dress appropriately for the cultural area and climate Use backpacks with featureless exteriors and that resemble normal day packs Avoid wearing jewelry and expensive watches,Sir_Player_One,16488513110,2

Some crack head who wants to have a stoush? Or some loser who wants to prove how "alpha" he is Or you? Are you prepared to potentially have an assault charge laid against you? Perhaps be charged with fighting in public or drunken disorderly? Will a criminal record effect your ability to work or travel? Are you prepared to perhaps be seriously injured or killed from being knocked to the ground and having your head bounce off the concrete? If violence is unavoidable then you need to strike first fast hard and often You dont stop the fight when you think the threat is no longer present or if he goes down You need to dominate the threat with an overwhelming show of force and violence Ensuring that they wont want to continue the fight when they get up and also dissuade any potential accomplices On that note dont make it a long drawn out affair Your goal should be to neutralize the threat and then practice some nike-fu or run-jitsu and get out of there Im not saying to cross the line from what could be constituted as reasonable force in a self defence situation But you need to get the point across that it isnt worth anyones time to try and do you harm,PanzerBiscuit,16488830030,2

h9gzz1t,p6qb47,Ill preface the whole story by saying I am an atheist and have never believed in ghosts One time I was in Portland OR for my 21st bday my ex and I had borrowed my parents truck and old camper and reserved an RV spot just out of town so we could afford a week long trip The drive was a long 12-14 hour drive in an old truck with bad/worn alignment pulling a super old camper that was not weighted properly from the factory So needless to say I was white knuckled just trying to keep the damn thing going straight and on the road We finally get there and I backed the trailer into the spot first try Good thing too cause I was so exhausted from the drive but still felt fine very excited to go out to dinner later that night We decided to go shower and get changed before dinner the camper shower didnt work but there were showers and bathrooms not far away and you had to have a key card to get in My ex goes of to the womens room and I go to the mens This isnt my first rodeo with public/communal showers luckly its totally empty so I can check all the stalls and see which one is cleanest 1st one is meh 2nd not bad 3rd is meh as well and the furthest back 4th was nasty looking with one curtain torn and one of the lights flickering I thought to myself "yikes that looks super gross #2 it is!" They were those "2 curtain" style showers with a curtain to the outside and one between the shower and a little changing room I close the curtain to the "outside" but leave the one between the shower and the room open just in case somebody comes in and tries to swipe my backpack Then I my shower shoes and feet wet first to make sure I wasnt going to slip and fall I got about halfway through my shower routine and go to watch the shampoo out of my hair when BAM! I was slammed against a wall with my arms pinned up above my head like somebody rushed me while my back was turned I whip around and and am trying to figure out what just happened I felt this like angry and hateful "vibe" on the other side of the curtain and was just filled with the strangest and most genuine fear And the only thought that kept running through my head so loudly it felt like somebody was saying out loud was "You will not break me" I ran out of there soaking wet and in a towel my ex just laughed at me I always thought ghost stuff was funny and faked every time But that I absolutely cannot explain but it felt so real,TheGreatKingCyrus,16293318030,10
h9glvbp,p6qb47,As of last week I had never bought a lottery ticket or gambled in my life Then I had a dream that I bought a very specific scratch off lottery ticket from a gas station down the street and won $2500 In my dream the ticket was a crossword puzzle game To put my mind at rest I went down to the gas station to prove to myself the type of ticket I had dreamed didnt even exist I got to the front of the line and they had a display with all the scratch offs in it There were probably 70 different types of tickets but none had crossword puzzles I figured since I went all the way down there I might as well just buy a ticket anyway I point to the ticket I want And the cashier checks under the counter and comes back up and tells me the one I pointed to is out of stock but they will be replacing it with a new type and I can buy that one if I want since its the same price I feel embarrassed enough already that Im buying a damn scratch off out in public so I just agree Then what does the motherfucker pull out and hand me?? Its a fucking crossword scratch off! On my way home Im thinking my stars have aligned and its going to be my lucky day And I realize I dont actually have anything to scratch off a ticket with since I never carry cash or change I pulled into my driveway and noticed something shiny on the sidewalk its a goddamn brand new one dollar coin I go inside with my dream ticket a new lucky coin and begin scratching away I didnt win shit but its still a cool story,officer897177,16293251730,3

The baby started coming at 2 they went in to get you up and you werent there I had to drive 20 miles in the middle of the night to get here It turns out that three people the pregnant sister her husband and the the other sister had each checked the tiny room with the single bed with a duvet cover and we were nowhere to be found So that was pretty strange Even stranger was in the course of a seperate conversation Id mentioned to my girlfriend that Id been having these weird disturbing dreams about these tall gangly people (for a better word) with outsized heads and large dark eyes performing tortures/experiments on the pair of us What sort of experiments? she asked That wed been bent over backwards and our heads immersed in a vat of some sort of grey slime Ive been having the same she said Now remember this was way back in the mid 80s UFOs and aliens were considered the preserve of cranks and crackpots Most people (including myself) thought that they were CIA/US military shenannigens Well before the X Files and alien autopsies even entered the public consciousness never mind that description To this day I still cant get my head around it That three people independently verified that we were not in a place that we knew we were in and that at the same time both myself and my girlfriend were having exactly the same abduction dreams Then again maybe it was just some big elaborate setup for an inexplicably weird and cruel joke that just happened to have been arranged by everybody during a birth event purely to freak me out and they were all in on it 35 years later and I still cant decide what is the more unlikely explanation,SmokyBarnable01,16293289540,3
h9fwpi9,p6qb47,My husband and I were taking a walk along a riverwalk area in our community We were in our mid-fifties so more like a stroll It was about 7:30 pm in June Weather was perfect sun starting to go down no mosquitoes The riverwalk had a few different walking surfaces concrete brick and the occasional metal grate We werent talking to each other at the time just keeping heads down to see what we were stepping on next My husband was walking by my side on my left With no intention to do so I stopped The tips of both shoes were touching where the brick met the metal grate I felt no force from in front of that would have caused me to suddenly stop Nothing pulled me from behind to keep me from walking I didnt lose balance I simply stopped During the first nanosecond after coming to a halt I thought "how funny I am toeing the line as it were" My head was down and I was looking at my shoes In the next nanosecond I thought I saw a burst of white light coming from the outer corner of my left eye from where my husband was The third nanosecond I felt my husband grip my left upper arm and I wondered if he had stopped as well I was about to break the silence when hubbys grip intensified and I knew something was wrong All of these thoughts and observations happened in a flash I dont remember what he said but hubby couldnt take another step Fortunately we were within arms reach of a railing so we both grabbed it and held on Hubby then said he felt terrible and was seeing stars I leaned into him to keep him from falling talking to him as I reached in his pocket and got our cell phone He collapsed and I did my best to break his fall and ease him onto the metal grate I turned him on his side in case he puked and called 911 Help came quickly and he was transported to ER He was stabilized and diagnosed with several heart problems not the least of which was ventricular tachycardia which caused his collapse VT is a life threatening emergency He was in the hospital for a week and received an ICD (implantable cardiac defibrillator) During the week I was with him in the hospital I replayed that evening many times in my head The replay was always the same I am picturing it now as I write this I was wearing a red top and black shorts and sat on the metal grate cradling his head to make him more comfortable while waiting for the ambulance Hubby was wearing a white tshirt and jeans I thought about the strangeness of how we both stopped at the same time And being so near a railing that would support him Being in a public place easily accessible by ambulance The odd juxtaposition of a perfect summer evening and a life or death event One day during his hospital stay a nurse gave to me hubbys clothes to take home The shirt was cut in many places to remove it quickly during the crisis But that was not what surprised me The shirt was yellow not white I would have sworn on a stack of bibles and souls of my children that he was in a white shirt Yes it was my husbands yellow shirt but no way was he wearing it that evening To this day I still see him in my minds eye wearing a white shirt So I have many questions What stopped me at the exact moment my husband needed me? I could have easily been walking a step or two ahead and not seen him collapse where he would likely have hit his head on the brick walkway or metal grate Or the railing That alone could have killed him What was that white flash of light? It was not the sun due to the time of evening where pinks golds and oranges prevail Why was he apparently in a white shirt not yellow? My very religious sister thinks he was wrapped in angel protection for lack of a better expression I am not conventionally religious but am open to spiritual ideas Was that his guardian angel? A deceased loved one breaking thru? God himself? A helper from a parallel universe?

h9gld0c,p6qb47,I used to live near a mental health hospital thats been used in a lot of movies Anyways there was a public bus that would go through that area and was the one I took home after elementary school with my grandma I remember looking out of the window at this patch of grass and seeing two headstones with flowers around them on fire but not actually burning I just kept my mouth shut cause I was in shock and also around 10 years old and at that point the bus was getting back on the highway A few years later I was walking through that area with a friend and noticed that there were plaques in the grass and it was in fact a cemetery Still cant explain it but it was a very weird feeling,anon-dreamer13,16293249380,2
h9h7xll,p6qb47,My great grandmother and my grandparents were preparing to go to a local community choir concert when about a half hour before the show my great grandmother refused to go Everyone was all dressed up and everything When my grandparents tried to convince her to come she said "No thank you I am going to die tonight and Id rather not do it in public " My grandparents insisted that she was not going to die as the doctor they had visited last week said she most likely had a few more months or years in her (She was 95) due to her decent health to which my great grandma responded "Look no one but God tells me what to do Ill die when I want to!" She died in the bathroom about 2 hours later which would have been in the middle of the concert Not sure if it counts as supernatural but its nice to know where my family gets its stubborn pettiness from,TheGingerConcierge,16293355310,2
h9hv6o8,p6qb47,Long story short my first friend that I had ever made was named Maciej we attended preschool together and became very close Even at such a young age I vividly remember the bond we built to this day Elementary school had begun & I had moved to another town and lost contact with Maciej With no up-to date contact info for him or his parents contact was completely lost As I got older I often wonder about Maciej and wonder what ever happened to him Fast forward years later I graduated high school and decided to attended my local county community college First day of classes Im sitting in a public speaking class and the professor begins doing attendance Suddenly she fires off his name It was such a unique name I thought to myself holy shit it had to be him unsure I make eye contact with him for a visual and look away The professor then calls my name out I peer back over at him it was at this moment I was greeted with an enthusiastic "dude no way !!" In the middle of the professors attendance we got up and did a bro hug It was a awesome feeling We waited till after class was over to catch up After all those years it was surreal to be reunited As the semester progressed we became tight again Heres where the story gets unexplainable after rekindling a friendship the very next semester Maciej was involved in a fatal car accident I couldnt believe it I had just reconnected with him after all those year and then that happens ? It was a weird emotion I couldnt explain it hit me harder than I had expected I attended his service it was both beautiful and sad It was amazing to see how many people he connected with in his life that came to pay respects The night after his service i had the most vivid dream In my dream my phone had gone off with a text notification from Maciej the text read "hey dude I just wanted to let you know Im okay" I remember feeling a wave of emotions in my dream! I remember panicking thinking in my dream how is this possible? I even replayed How are you texting me if you passed !? It was that real To this day I had never had a dream as detailed and conscious like than that specific one The kicker I woke up trying to make sense of the dream feeling all sorts emotions Later that day on his facebook multiple people had wrote on his wall that he visited them in their dreams that night prior too I felt / feel that although it was short he came back into my life for a reason and I take the dream that I had as him letting me know hes okay,klechhh,16293475510,2
h9i5mdt,p6qb47,This thread has some crazy but awesome stuff Makes my experience feel a bit underwhelming in comparison but Ive enjoyed others stories and I havent shared this with anyone for sometime now so I figure Id contribute About 10 years ago I was in Argentina with a friend walking down the street Walking along a partially crowded sidewalk I saw a girl walking toward us that was *captivating* I dont mean that as an as interchangeable word with beautiful; she was pretty but not the type where you would give it a much of a second thought on a busy street She was dressed for field hockey including a stick Overall she was interesting but it her eyes seemed to be epicenter of the draw Nothing that I recall being particularly noteworthy except for the sensation of being captivated and fascinated Both my buddy and I looked to at each other after passing her and with few words realized we had had a similar snap moment experience Within a minute or so we were worrying about catching the bus that had just passed us and we ran and barely got on We handed the driver the money and moved towards the back of bus to stand and hold the the overhead rails I remember being partially zoned out mindlessly reflecting on various things with a good portion of the thoughts trying to figure out what had happened with the hockey stick girl 5-10 minutes passed by as the bus worked its way through town moving to the city limits I see the shuffle of feet as new passengers took their places There amidst all the feet I did a double take I saw a field hockey stick Now field hockey is popular in Argentina and more so with women; but not extremely common to where you see loads of girls running around with equipment all over Nevertheless I look up and you guessed it it was the very same hockey stick girl I was completely dumbfounded Whats more she was equally as captivating as she was before I know I tried not to stare but I couldnt help it It both felt like a very short and a very long time until she got off the bus I dont know how to explain how she got on the bus that far after us and why she was so intriguing And more the combination of the two things that leave me scratching my head; why was hockey stick girl so fascinating in the first place followed by her using magical teleportation abilities in order to use public transportation,fightforfiving,16293549710,2

So I broke it off with her said we could not remain friends and she did not take it well Then I found out during the breakup that she had lied about her age when we met and that she was underage - I was 19 and she was 15 Not quite a crime where I live but not something I was interested in and a big red flag on top of everything else She started showing up at my work when I was on shift in desperation and I had to hide in the back to avoid her Like she thought doubling down on injecting herself in my life would fix the situation for her She eventually got banned after my manager dealt with it a few times She even showed up at my grandparents house when I was there once though I had never told her where they lived Im no Adonis and I was hardly interesting let alone suave at 19 years old Zero style zero game The first time we met she was crying alone in a public place and I stopped to comfort her I guess she just latched on hard She stopped eventually but I never caught her following me and the whole thing was pretty fucked up I was not trusting in relationships for a fair time afterwards,marin4rasauce,16218741640,2

gzakl8b,njrvgm,She threw the last third of a drink into my face then told me to get her another one I ended the relationship and she refused "you cant break up with me and besides I never stopped seeing my ex-boyfriend!" She stalked me for 3 weeks Followed me to and from work Sat in her car outside my house overnight multiple times in a row I found out about the stalking when she called me to ask what I had been doing at work and who I was sneaking into my house As I was attempting to confront her about her erratic behavior in a horny moment of terrible life choices she said "come over and lets have sex one last time no strings attached" and I agreed and went over to her place On the way home I got into a car accident that wrecked my car I was physically uninjured but I really loved that car! I told her I wrecked my car and it was fate telling me I made a mistake seeing her again She backed off after that she was strangely superstitious In retrospect I should have "noped" out before the relationship ever started when she was casually racist in regular conversations She was sweet and loving to me in private In public she was violent erratic and insulting The drink throwing incident that pushed me over the edge occurred while we were hanging out with her best friend Im sure it was an attempted show of dominance,MiscreantAristocrat,16218765150,2
gzaoaut,njrvgm,My friend in college introduced me to a new girl on campus she just knew casually She was sort of shy and quiet which I dont mind and while shed go out she wasnt a crazy blackout party animal She didnt seem to mind me drinking though so that was okay Turns out my friend didnt really know this girl at all or she didnt see the side of her that I did! This girl had never had a serious boyfriend and me being on a "knight on a white horse" sort of kick decided to ask her out That was a mistake! This girl was quiet and reserved in public but in private she started yelling at me cussing me out getting really angry about things that didnt seem to be very important Then a month or two later she started hitting me when she was going off She also started saying things like "Youre just a piece of shit and nobody likes you" and "Who would ever want to date you? I hate you sometimes!" A lot of the time I didnt even know what set her off It was confusing and very uncomfortable Did I mention there was no sex? None At all Not even making out or anything There was one incident though check this shit out This girl wasnt romantic and didnt want to talk about sex or have it etc One night though she came to my dorm got naked and layed on my bed I was shocked for a minute but then got naked and joined her I kissed her talked to her touched her and went down on her etc which received no reaction (In my experience thats a bit odd) She also didnt touch me try to give me a bj crawl on top of me start playing with herself none of that I ended up getting on top of her and right before I was about to enter her I asked "So you did get on birth control right?" (We had discussed that maybe a month or two ago and she said she would) She says no she didnt What the hell? I mean if I hadnt stopped to askand why didnt she tel me before I was 1 second away from being inside her? So I stopped right there and got off of her She said she didnt have condoms and if I didnt have any then she was leaving I actually didnt have any but that afternoon we were right in front of the drugstore in town! If she had an idea that this was going to be going down perhaps she should have mentioned that! Anyways she just got up got dressed and started to leave I said next time Ill have condoms but since this is both our faults would you help me out? (I mean I would have gone down on her again if she had wanted me to but she didnt seem to want that at all) She just said no why would I help you out with anything like that? I was left to finish myself off and wonder about what the hell that was all about That was the only time anything like that ever happened with her I left her after a few months because something was really wrong with her and she was rarely a good/nice/sweet person Not to be an ass or anything but she didnt deserve me I wasnt full to bursting with self confidence so it took a little while for that to sink in for me The kicker is that once I left her I found an amazing girl I totally clicked with and it was great! It was great until my ex started pretty much stalking me and lying to people about me;including the new girl It got really bad and she broke up with me which almost killed me I didnt get over that girl for years The thing is once the crazy ex managed to destroy my relationship that I was really happy in she didnt even make a move to try and get me back! (Not that I would have done that anyways) I wish I had never met that crazy bitch,guitarandbooks,16218781340,2

Red Flag #4 I had been having some serious mental health issues and the three above mentioned things were really straining my mental health because I felt like she was possibly still with her "ex boyfriend" and one night I saw her send message that said "I love you too and Ill see you tomorrow" to him and I kinda lost my cool Ill admit I freaked out and that wasnt cool and damaged our already fragile relationship The 5th and Final red Flag was that she was going to a concert alone with her ex boyfriend and tried to gaslight me into think she had already told me even tho she hadnt and was trying to hide who she was going with Queue me booking an emergency appointment with my then therapist who told me that I have two options the one he recommends which is dumping her and the other which is just letting her know that I trust her thru a text message I chose the later because once again I was a dumb 20 year old Flash forward a week where she is talking about going over to a friends house and seeing two boxers (the dog breed) she hadnt seen in a long time the only person who had boxer breed for a dog was her ex boyfriend She then asked me if I trusted her which I replied yes to I then asked her the same thing and she replied "IDK sometimes you do really shady things" keep in mind I only ever went over to my friends house to hangout with who she called "My bros" to drink a little beer maybe play some Mario party and went to school/work/the theatre for rehearsals I just replied "Oh my fucking god I cant fucking do this anymore" At first she was confused and I just explained it as "THIS this constant bullshit between us Its so fucking tiring and I cant do it anymore Im done Im leaving you" I went to college the next day and sure as shit she was all cuddled up with her ex holding his hand all that bullshit I just solace in the fact that I knew she was fucking playing me and that I finally stood up for myself Oh and if this helps explain any of her actions she was massively bipolar and refused to take her meds,Tickle_My_Butthole_,16218877180,2

I wasnt really feeling this guy but I hadnt met him in person yet so I figured its only fair to give him a chance irl Some people have weird vibes over text but when you meet them they might be really cool When planning the date he kept suggesting things like a hike or going over to his house for dinner I wasnt comfortable with that because I dont know him and no matter how old I am- I never ever go somewhere alone with someone I dont know I suggested going out to dinner (in public) and he reluctantly agreed I didnt like him He was nice and all but there was something about him that I cant describe that made me feel anxious and uneasy After the date he wanted me to come back to his place I said no thank you so he walked me to my car He asked again I said no thank you again Later that night he asked if we can do a second date and I declined I wasnt feeling him and something about him just made me feel *wrong* Like I cant explain it Anyway about a week or two later (I dont remember how much time passed honestly) he was in the local news for violently raping and assaulting a woman he met on the internet,rusty___shacklef0rd,16348474990,16

hhjuutg,qcqv9v,Years ago I was in top level government job and wanted to leave I was informed that a lobbyist wanted to open a branch of his firm in the capital and was looking for someone with exactly my profile to be head of the branch I met with him and got uncomfortable really fucking fast The man had no idea what he was talking about setting expectations that were not plausible in the slightest In my experience people in that line of work that have that much of a disconnect with reality tend to be  fixers  instead of legitimate lobbyist as in instead of putting the work in to convince the government of their objectives they do illegal things to buy their way in I politely declined the job offer A year or two later I had become head of a powerful business network/lobbying institution A few weeks after my hiring had been announced in the newspapers I was contacted again by that man He also had changed jobs and was now head of some sort of business school for high ranking public officials in local administrations that was funded near entirely by his political contacts (school that coincidentally had the same initials as him) He wanted desperately to sign a contract with us for cooperation I got what three to five messages a week on his part for two months ? I said no politely at first but quite firmly the more he insisted There was just something that felt off with his insistence especially considering his local political contacts already managed to bully my members in the place he had his school set up in into signing a contract with him a contract that they (wisely) managed to prevent from having any legal value whatsoever The contract he was proposing had no added value be it for my workplace or his except the ability to make a press release about it Note by the way that a lot of my members actually provided the same services as he did so we would basically be helping a concurrent Understanding that my door was closed he called the chair of my board and tried to convince her using the same tactics When she told me I advised her to redirect any new inquiries from him to me and refuse to talk with him Thats when I got news from my aunt See my aunt was at the time one of the highest ranking public servants in the State and was approached too She had the same feeling as I did and blocked him out but that got her curious She discreetly looked into the inner workings of his business and his accounting She was not pleased with what she discovered to say the least Word quickly got around to stay the fuck away from that man My father who is the owner of one of the biggest newspaper of the place began to investigate and was quietly notified by the police to back off A year later the man was arrested The formation he was supposedly providing his students never existed Only one class ever graduated He took millions from his school to funnel into his failing business with whom he had made the school sign a contract for paid services (a HUGE legal no-no) And thats without talking about the wages he took from the school that were unheard of for a school of that size Quickly it appeared that the school mainly served as a way for high ranking people to network together and go on  teaching trips  in foreign countries The police arrested a lot of high ranking public officials that funded him discovering payouts or in some cases sexual relationships between them and some of the workers of the school (which is illegal in my country: if you have a  personal interest  in a place you cant decide anything related to that place) The trial is impending TLDR: years ago I declined a job offer by a man I immediately distrusted Some times later he tried to bully me in my new job to help him out in his new business I refused A year or two later he got arrested for corruption and fraud,MrBlackTie,16348570750,6
hhj4jmg,qcqv9v,I dodged three nukes with one bad decision that saved my life my sanity and my future In the 90s I had my heart broken by an ex I had rescued from a bad relationship and moved back to my hometown with After my stint in the USN she had started contacting my grandmother I had little money but a decent job and an apartment I left the job to help her She was being terrorized by a guy she had met after we were separated by me being taken by CPS and moved away from an abusive family She contacted my grandma to ask for my help Grandma was the only person in the family that I spoke to I called her and agreed to help her get her things back We ended up together for 6 months before she called it off after reconnecting with her trashy hometown friends and hooking up with a guy at the E-club in San Diego I tried to contact her a few times She told me I was a stalker then swore I had broken into her car I had not She made it impossible for me to keep my new job by calling and complaining about me to my boss so I gave away all my non-portable possessions and took a job selling magazines all over the USA I was waiting for my GI Bill and financial aid to start school but why sit there and wait a whole year? This was a bad decision but it saved my ass The reasons for this decision being bad was the crew life We went from city to city state to state selling subscriptions in parking lots and door-to-door It sucked but I was good at it and had some fine adventures Everyone else seemed to be into meth or cocaine or heroin except for two kids from Oklahoma who I instantly got along with I kept copies of every subscription I sold which included the addresses and names of the people involved This quirk (and my habit of keeping every piece of paper for years) would later save my freedom and my future The first nuke I dodged came in Wisconsin Sometimes crews would send a team with a car handler to a separate location (a "spur") I did not get along with the car handler who would lead the spur I told him I didnt want to head out with his spur and he said "Get on or get beat" I had been on the road for almost 7 months by this time and never gotten into any scraps I just didnt feel like half the shit they argued and fought over was worth it But this was and I wasnt going to head out with a hard-drinking idiot who drove like a maniac in the best of times Short version of the dodged nuke: The car handler tried to beat me up and got a busted nose a raccoon mask and a sore set of balls for his trouble The POS tweaker who usually helped him "assert authority" in the past did not wish to join in Three days later the crew manager picked me up outside the Harley factory (after a rad day selling to assembly line workers) and said "Well theyre gone and I wanted you to know before you turn on the TV" The car handler drunk in Minnesota had rolled a van with 10 other young adults inside killing them all Two of them were close friends and the rest were just lost souls that liked things I did not (mostly drugs) The crew manager who was in some ways a decent guy couldnt handle the guilt and offered to get us hired on with other crews He was done with the business But it was time for me to go home and start school in a month so he paid me out thanked me and drove me halfway to CA (to TX) and got me a plane ticket home Along the way we hit a lot of strip clubs bars and pretty amazing restaurants he had discovered near hotels over his years in the business We became good friends on that last road trip Back home I had just settled into an apartment and called a friend to say I was in town and wanted to go buy some furniture I didnt know that the whole time before I returned my ex had convinced everyone I was stalking her harassing her husband-to-be/E-club sleazy hookup While I was gone she had filed for protective orders (which they never served and were thus dismissed) and had regularly filed police complaints about new "incidents" She told the Sheriffs who were trying to serve and find me that I was "hiding out and selling drugs to get by" Within an hour of that call to a friend who truly thought I had gone rogue and underground and was terrorizing my ex my door got kicked in and I was arrested I had no idea what for What I did have was receipts; 7 months of them all over the USA from WA to NC to Michigan What the police had was 5 reports one every month and a half of me assaulting menacing calling or burgling her I was shocked but I was innocent and knew it I kept my mouth shut and demanded a lawyer My Public Defender tried to sell me a deal which I was not having one bit of She demanded I explain how I would defend myself and I mentioned my magazine sales receipts and gave her my crew managers home phone number Two days later the charges were dismissed After that hearing her squid guy served me with her fresh DVRO 10 days later the fresh attempt at a DVRO was dismissed with prejudice when I showed up to the the hearing with receipts and a written and Fedexd letter from my former boss and now loyal amigo Nuke dodged She left state with her POS sailor who had finished his enlistment They apparently had a rocky relationship after the first kids were born She cheated on him often and he has hung in there I have seen pictures of their kids (we still have childhood friends in common and people always want to know about that time in my life) She looks haggard too Two of her kids look like a guy she cheated with from MySpace something I was made aware of by one of the same trashy friends (who is friends with one of my sisters) who took her to the E-club and now gleefully spreads news of her shitty existence She has filed multiple restraining orders against her cheat-exes and a couple against her husband is diagnosed as having a BPD and suffering from manic depression The Nuke I dodged there was that I loved her and I might have even taken her back after she cheated She contacted me on FaceBook and I immediately quit the app completely when I started feeling sentimental Holy crap No lady!

hhjbkq5,qcqv9v,This is weirdly coincidental because I just watched a video last night about one of the guys involved which had randomly popped up on my YouTube feed [He regrets his actions Fuck him](https://youtube/7LnM3xGOIPM) It was May 2000 This was in the days of good old AOL with the loud ass dial up tone A few of us cut class and took public transit from the Bronx out to Jersey to try to bag shorties for prom which was coming up soon We had a good time but I do not think any of us actually brought any of them to prom We hung out pretty late then headed back to the city to split up and go home to our respective boros My best friend since we were 8 in the third grade lived right around the corner so we took the 7 back to Main Street We must have gotten to the last stop around 11/before midnight because Wendys was closing soon I was hungry and wanted to grab something but my homie was tired or didnt wanna go since they were closing up shop and basically said he wanted to go straight home He persuaded me so we continued on our walk to our respective cribs Having school the next morning I woke up to the sound of choppers overhead Going to take the bus I saw mad news helicopters and a large police presence on the streets It was apparent there was something going on but I was still not sure what Later we found out there had been a massacre in that same Wendys by 2 guys who had robbed the place One of them was previously a worker who I believe may have served me chili and nuggets in the past Either way I am extremely glad we never went that night Who knows WTF couldve happened I was best man at his wedding years later His wife was one of the girls wed met that night  RIP to all the innocent lives lost that night I wish the survivors the best in life,j0k3rNhArL3y,16348486400,3

hhii2ft,qcqv9v,My ex girlfriend I really cared about her but she was never as invested in the relationship yet did a good job trying to convince me she was While we were together I lost my best friend to cancer and was an emotional wreck While my friend was dying she moved across the country to a different school than I went to and immediately became distant We broke up once then and got back together at Christmas It all ended up with us living in the college town I went to over the next summer where every single day she used the knowledge of how much I cared to manipulate and make me feel like shit It didnt help I was on a medication that made my anger worse that was supposed to help me with depression when I was actually misdiagnosed and had pretty severe anxiety It was one night where she was putting on her little act to make me feel like shit and I lost it on her in public After that I realized staying with her was going to result in me either getting arrested or my shit kicked in because of how often she tried to play on my temper We stayed together like one more month and broke up when she went back to her school I really cared so I spent some time well into the next year trying to understand what I did wrong and then I realized she was never that into me and I should stop caring Ive been in a loving relationship since then for 5 years Theres a lot more to this story but I dont want to pull a my crazy ex girlfriend because frankly I think we were just awful for eachother I jokingly refer to her as my Tammy 2 with friends I brought out the worst in her and she brought out the worst in me,Jacklon17,16348367280,3

hhij27k,qcqv9v,I am a trans woman who commutes to a city via train 2-4 times a week I decided that I will pretend to be a man because I look like one so I dont get bashed for being trans One day the train line I usually take was replaced by coaches for line repairs So late on a monday at around 8pm I took the coach back home and took a seat in the back corner so I would not draw attention to myself Two people came on the coach and sat on the opposite side of me a woman and an irish man The coach driver said that this is the coach for (my town) station so if you are on the the wrong coach get out now and the lady drunkenly said thank you for that When the coach started moving the man was playing EDM as loud as possible on his phone and most people close to the back moved forwards I did not because I had a guitar on me and moving would be impractical and since the two were not sober they might have a negative reaction to me moving since I had to have slid next to them to move He played his music for about 30 minutes I just turned up my music on my headphones and messaged my classmates about the situation because they always tell me to message if I am safe on the late night commutes The man was getting more and more erratic he couldnt sit still and kept moving seats He was not just drunk he had likely taken ice (the australian street name for crystal meth) So I am sitting next to someone who is on one of the worst drugs you could be on About an hour after we got on the coach the man decides to lie down so his head is touching my leg I politely asked him to move and he asked if I paid for that seat and I was scared and frosen because it reminded me of a time when someone did the exact same thing when I was a kid and yelled at me when I said no and the memories came flooding back He yelled at me and I did not say a word back I was blank and scared Luckily he got out of my face and kept looking at me I drowned myself into my music He got out of his seat and walked to the driver and they talked I did not hear what they said and the irish man walked back to his seat 10 minutes go pass and he walked up again and the driver lets him off the coach early A bit of time goes pass and the lady accompanying him talked to me and apologised she seamed to have sobered up and realised what happened we talked about the man she was trying to shake the man off because he was following her even to the point of going on the same coach as her After what felt like an eternity of a coach ride and trying to hold back tears we got to the station The coach driver said that anyone involved should talk to him and some ptv (public transport victoria) workers So I stayed behind and the driver had to apologies to try and keep his job because he broke company policy to let the man of the coach because the man asked to get off early or else he would bash up one of the passengers and the driver The other employees said that he did the right thing and that he did not have to apologies I then explained what happened I left and got into the car that my sister was picking me up in When I got home I started screaming and crying myself to sleep and told my family Only because I realised that the passenger that he would have bashed would have been me because I made him angry for asking him to move his head away from my leg So had the bus driver not let him off or had Id dress in my female clothes I could have died or seriously injured because ice addicts cant feel pain so fighting back would do nothing plus I am not that strong and I am not that tactical under pressure Lastly I have not been on a bus since and I have been on a coach once since and had a breakdown on the coach I also did not turn up to uni the following day because I still needed to process it,AnjiAnju,16348371230,1

Do they say phrases like "working with" or do they use phrases like "where youll be working" Lots of polished liars will try to tell mostly the truth or you phrases that lie by omission or * If you do meet potential coworkers and the seem to be trying to warn you or actively hunting jobs * The company has been around for a few years but promotes themselves as a "start-up" * Major Discrepancy between Managements furniture / Public Meeting area furniture and employee furniture * Numerous "white lies" and embellishments instead of hard achievements by management,Buckshott00,16421193330,2

hskf4y9,s34d9b,Sending a bunch of contracts along with your offer letter that are "mandatory" for you to get the job but the terms are nonnegotiable and they contain completely unenforceable garbage that runs contrary to federal or state employment laws (or are just really REALLY shady and completely unbalanced against the employee) Specific examples include: * you agree to go to arbitration with an arbitrator of their choosing whose decision is completely binding and not appealable for any "complaints" involving sexual harassment pay disputes etc rather than suing them * You "authorize" automatic payroll deduction for "damage theft or loss" of "company property" caused by your "negligence or willful conduct" with no details on what constitutes negligence In other words someone breaks into your house and steals the company laptop theyre taking the cost out of your paycheck * You consent to a search of all your property and it specifies this includes your car bags etc and it specifies who can do this like company security and maybe actual law enforcement but they fail to limit it to "while on company property" or something In other words selective specificity Oh you were actually on the public road outside the parking lot when we stopped you? Well the agreement doesnt say where * Completely illegal wage shit like when a staffing agency says they wont pay you if your hours arent approved by the client and/or they wont pay you until the client pays them These are all giant red flags telling you you are not on equal footing they are going to take advantage of you at every turn and they think the law is something scary to threaten workers with but not something they themselves need to follow,spectralvixen,16421227410,2

hsl3fni,s34d9b,Teacher here Pre-pandemic when I was going to hiring conventions while an undergrad interviewing with charters was always a fun and interesting experience My first time interviewing with said schools they promoted the amount of resources appliances and utilities offered to teachers and students This was more often than not a marketing pitch for essentially the same stuff the average public school would offer with a little bit of flexibility for parental wants/needs The biggest red flag that might trick people though was the amount of "autonomy" and "opportunity for growth" They try to sell you this fantasy of becoming a "DEAN" after only one to two years of teaching! Becoming a dean meant more control over the program larger pay grade and offering grad opportunities for other degrees Sounds good on paper right? WRONG the average success rate in years for charter schools is about 4 years If it does not survive that 4th year it generally fails and goes under with only the president walking away with the financial insurance/security of their business imploding Charters suck they are not places for learning they just take advantage of already financially struggling families; while there are a few good ones out there that seek to help families with children with very specific needs (generally severe physical or mental disabilities) they are for the most part all equally bad to teach in and even the higher end of the salary scale if you make it through all the BS is essentially the equivalent of that of a normal public school teacher salary By the time youd be able to reap any of the shiny offers they stated the charter will most likely be ready to go bankrupt and fail Stay away at all costs if you have interest or inclination in teaching stick to the public school system and support the union If you really wanna give charters a shot be prepared to do a lot of research and detective work on the school and talk to the present teachers there,Jake_FromStateFarm27,16421335490,2

hsmhckh,s34d9b,It is basically four things False Promises Missleading Advertisements Misdirection Future Promises Promises from people in suits are worth the toilet paper in their public shitting booth If it is not signed dated and contractually enforced it is virtually worth nothing A well trained business major will literally break his promise to you to let you off to bury your own grandparents because you are absolutely critical to staffing that weekend and he cannot let you go Missleading Advertisements are things like salary or work conditions For example the phrase "Industry Leading" Is a fucking joke and then some It is almost always used by niche non-compete industries where no one gives a fuck that you are a leading partner in Infact industry leading often translates to employee fucking Salary wise hard upfront numbers are your best bet No bullshit a straight shooter that tells you this is what you get every hour these are the bonuses for shifts x and y this is what you can expect as a bonus for this this is what we cover this is what we dont If anywhere in the recruitment process you where lured into the talks with one number and then told a different number you leave no questions asked Because you are being effectively fucked by dishonest sleazy paper pushers Misdirection would be promising you your dream position yet just trying to poach you for a different job You expect your work environment to be X yet they want to shove you into Y Doesnt matter whether you are a single parent that has time constraints that must be respected or that you have health issues that must be respected If you where offered one thing and yet are pushed towards another ce la vie As for future promises; Anything that isnt in paper is worth nothing They will all promise you a promotion if you do good guarantee a future if you excel in your effort Yet ask one of them to put their money where their mouth is and to contractually obligate themselves to advance and educate you when you meet actual numbers and suddenly they all start flinching And thats not by coincidence,Competitive-Wealth69,16421660160,2

h4a3ou1,oesza5,Edit: this photo isnt normal Ive scrolled a long way surprised I havent seen this one This is fucked up so warning about this one Tara Leigh Calico (born February 28 1969)[1] is an American woman who disappeared near her home in Belen New Mexico on September 20 1988 She is widely believed to have been kidnapped In July 1989 a Polaroid photo of an unidentified young woman and boy gagged and seemingly bound was televised to the public after it was found in a convenience store parking lot in Port St Joe Florida Family friends thought the woman resembled Calico and contacted her mother who then met with investigators and examined the Polaroid She believed it was her daughter after taking "time growth and lack of makeup" into consideration and noted that a scar on the womans leg was identical to one that Calico had Scotland Yard analyzed the photo and concluded that the woman was Calico but a second analysis by the Los Alamos National Laboratory disagreed An FBI analysis of the photo was inconclusive [the photo](https://uploadwikimediaorg/wikipedia/en/1/11/Unidentified_kidnapping_victims_1989jpg) The book is (edit: NOT) [Flowers in the Attic](https://enwikipediaorg/wiki/Flowers_in_the_Attic) But another book by the same author My Sweet Audrina,nat2r,16256048830,64

gw3sptw,mzn0fa,I noticed this in the last episode of Falcon and the Winter soldier when (no spoilers) one character gives a big monologue to a group of people admonishing them for what they were planning to do while TV cameras are capturing everything In the real world this character would have been talked over interrupted the TV cameras might have stopped rolling at some point basically there is no way they would have been able to continue for the full 5 minutes or so uninterrupted Basically in the real world unless youre giving a public speech or maybe youre a teacher or someones boss it is not likely that people are going to let you basically lecture them unabated like that Additionally to that this group of people changed what they were just about to do based on this lecture It would be nice if that could happen in the real world but it didnt feel super realistic,SkepticalUnicorn,16195622300,2
