gvwk8sj,myeqin,Really depends on the type of care home the types of residents and their conditions etc I work as a nurse and am fairly burned out from it But honestly a few hours of socializing with people x 7 = 20 hours per week If your wage is 20$ / hour youre basically paying 800$ worth of your time per month If youre cool with that power to ya but im tired Cant do it anymore lol I literally only want to be alone these days Covid has taught me one thing: Im totally fine being totally alone,Namedoesntmatter89,16194198670,3
gvupsp7,myeqin,Covid aside (because I dont want to risk spreading it to them) I would probably have to decline despite hating the concept of rent; I know from having seen my maternal grandmothers memory collapse due to dementia (she passed away in 2019) that it would be really tough on my mental health (as would a high death rate) Plus I tend to like being very independent with managing my time (I do have some altruistic reasons for thisas I spend part of it on climate activism) so Im not convinced it would really work- and much as it might be fun to try and teach them all how to play Smash Bros Ultimate (and I dont mind doing jigsaw puzzles those are fun),Overgrown_fetus1305,16193810670,2
gvv76o0,myeqin,I sort of do this in a roundabout way! My boyfriend and I have a condo that he got a great deal on because our complex was built in the early 80s He was able to use the money he saved to renovate the kitchen and living/dining area to be much more modern too which is a huge bonus The thing about our condos is that well over half of our neighbors are senior citizens and a bunch of them have lived here pretty much since the place was built Our building is 8 units were the only young couple theres 2 young single people that pretty much keep to themselves (except for when the one living above us goes stomping about like an irish step dance troup) one older but not elderly single lady two elderly couples and there was one elderly single guy but he just moved to the west coast to care for a family member Now if someone had told me before I moved in that I was going to be amazing friends with a bunch of my elderly neighbors I would have thought they were nuts but Ive gotten super close to a few of them! The couple we share a wall with are insanely sweet and try to feed us like all the time Its great because theyre wonderful cooks! And the building across from us I help one elderly single lady with her groceries because she stubbornly lives on the second floor and the man who lives under her well Shoot Ill sit on his front patio with him and talk for *hours* Hes an amazing storyteller Its been really good for me too Ive lost both grandfathers (one during covid) and Im no-contact with my moms mother and stepmother so I dont have very many older family members Im close with Its been really cathartic and Ive made some really good friends If you get the chance choose the old people!,3opossummoon,16193895580,2

gwejjpa,myeqin,I currently work in a nursing home on the dementia unit and even if I could live in one of the other units it would be a big hell no Even other units have residents with behaviors If its not that you can hear the residents from the dementia unit screaming while youre in another unit We are one of the best nursing homes in our area and residents are taken care of but nursing homes are sad and they really go there to die Some of the illnesses that I have seen nurses try to treat us ridiculous because they know the resident is on their deathbed but they have to do everything in their power to help them Residents are there because they cannot take care of themselves and theyll be there until they die or until their family decides to bring them home with hospice They do need the human interaction but if you lived there you would become another resident and it would be no different than them interacting with the other residents They are encouraged to participate in activities and eat in the dining room with the other residents so they do get to spend time with people The employees (CNAs nurses dietary administration etc) all go out of their way to talk to the residents as well Family can once again come visit (if theyre COVID free) Residents that arent from the dementia unit are not restricted to their unit either they can roam the entire facility All residents can leave with family whenever they like Everyone is mentioning the stories they would hear but I promise that after a week they would all be repeats One of the reasons I actually prefer the dementia unit is because the other units tend to have grouchier residents (comes with age I dont blame them) and residents who think theyre entitled to your every waking moment Which reminds me some of the residents dont sleep! It would be like living in a college dorm again I already spent 40 hours a week there; I love my job and I love my residents but hell no I cant speak for retirement facilities but as for nursing homes I dont know of anyone that would make it longer than a week Edit: I forgot to mention the sheer amount of illness in nursing homes Obviously elderly have weakened immune systems but since working in a nursing home Ive seen contagious illnesses Ive never even heard of or havent heard about in a long time I havent heard of anyone getting scabies since my dad got it when he was 5 and I started working in a nursing home and 5 of my residents have it Things like C Diff and MRSA are concerns as well as pneumonia and the flu,IatrogenicBlonde,16197731390,2
gvuw5bi,myeqin,It would depend on a few factors 1) Depends on the home Retirement homes and nursing homes at least where I live are *very* different - retirement homes are for those who can live pretty independently (ie can wash themselves feed themselves toilet themselves etc) while nursing homes are for people who need more care such as washing dressing toileting medication administration etc Therefore interacting with people in a retirement home would be vastly different from those in a nursing home 2) Depends on the expectation of hours and types of activities expected of me I work 12-hour shifts On working days I dont have "a few hours" to spare However I could drop down to a part-time job or one with less demanding hours if I didnt have to pay rent Also am I just expected to hang out and interact with the residents or do I actually have to do work like washing people or cleaning? 3) What are my living arrangements like? Can I bring my cat? Can I expect a reasonable amount of privacy? Can I lock my door? People with dementia tend to wander and I know some can go into the wrong room and rummage through other peoples thingsor worse 4) Is it only rent-free or am I provided other things such as access to amenities meals etc? If I dont have to pay for most of my food or pay hydro fees then that would just sweeten the deal further and make the arrangement more appealing OVERALL Id probably go for it as long as I only had to hang out with the residents (and NOT have to do actual work) especially if it were just a retirement home I work as an RN I dont mind the elderly I can deal with most behaviours (but as I said as long as I can lock my door) Death? Sure it can be sad but death is not the worst thing in the world For a lot of people especially the very old its a relief A lot of older people have so many stories to tell I once volunteered at a nursing home and there was one lady who would carry secret military information in WW2 She would tell us of all the interesting people she met too One nursing home resident I looked after was a former nurse As a nursing student (at the time) she would tell me what it was like to be a nurse when she was younger - a far different experience than mine I love hearing what the world was like decades ago Not technically a nursing home resident but my dad has told me things that fascinate me He remembers going to school before ballpoint pens were the norm He said they would take turns refilling the ink wells at everyones desk in the classroom He told me how they practiced handwriting intensively and the teacher would correct them on things like the slant of their letters He said getting his COVID vaccine brought back memories of him waiting in line for the newly-released polio vaccine He watched the moon landing and gave money to Terry Fox as he ran through Toronto All of this happened before I was even born Obviously this would not be something I would do forever - it would just be for a couple of years perhaps while I saved some money to move into my own place,duckface08,16193841440,1
gvuzsbh,myeqin,Totally I spend time with my mom whos in a nursing home Well before covid and the lockdown happened I would come for lunch and chat up other residents Sometimes help them get something they needed cause the staff was usually busy I also helped organize my mons closet of stuff she didnt need and take her for a spin in the wheel chair which I could totally do for others Sometimes if I could t make it for lunch Id come later in the day Usually there is bingo so Id go to it with my mom Honestly me being there I would play so many games with residents Bingo balloon bounce whatever Id bring in old episodes of Jackass for them to watch One thing I learned from my mom getting older is that people getting kicked in the balls will forever be funny I also think my presence there will be beneficial for the residents Like her home is okay No bad smells But staff can be dismissive or ignore residents But some are great Some are just rundown Assuming that they cant kick me out having someone there who can contact corporate or the state over things might make things better for residents I wouldnt do this if I had to be in the Memory Care Unit That wing is sad and scary My mom was there for a month It was awful,PaulRuddsButthole,16193858740,1

Im always telling my 90 year old grandma who lives in the independent living part of a large retirement home/nursing home complex that I wish I could live with her And I mean it Elderly people are tons of fun have lots of knowledge to share and I just generally enjoy their company Before covid my grandma and 12 of her friends would have lunch in the dining room together every Sunday and had a rotating schedule of who would bring the wine Always had a blast when I got to join When I was in high school I worked as a waitress and cooks assistant in an assisted living facility Loved my job because of the residents Then when I was in college I worked as a CNA in the assisted living/nursing home section of a convent for Catholic nuns I loved that job too and I miss the nuns a lot I still keep in touch with a few of them A good retirement home/nursing home/assisted living facility has the aura of college dorms with residents who are just a lot older and generally more responsible and well behaved The sense of community is really wonderful and the attitude of most of the people is really laid back in my experience (Now if I was asked if I would live in one where the residents were not well taken care of the type where you walk in the door and you can smell the stale urine and feces then no Absolutely not Those places suck the life out of you so fast and usually have major problems with management understaffing employees who dont truly care and cases of elder abuse),RachelWeekdays,16193878000,1

gvvej34,myeqin,Aaaabsolutely Already did basically just that for most of July 17- September 18 My grandmother lived in a retirement home thats part of a chain of retirement homes and they had a few spare rooms for residents to stay in who were traveling (ie she could leave the home in Dallas and while traveling to Boulder stay a night in one of the spare rooms at the home in OKC) Anyway I was fresh out of college very sociable and needed a place to stay while I figured my logistics out (I was working as an HR temp for three days a week and building sets for a theater in Dallas in the evenings so I was less a vagrant and more just a young dude with a lot of free time during the days) Id done some work for the manager of that retirement home when I was in high school and I was there to eat with my grandmother and her friends in their big dining hall for dinner at least four nights a week so the owner offered to let me stay in one of their spare rooms if I helped the residents with their furniture-moving needs ran their bingo games for them on Tuesday and Thursdays and ran their movie nights The furniture-moving turned into a lot of chatting while I moved couches around and some of the folks whose spouses had already passed would definitely ask me to help them move furniture just to have someone to talk to I liked it a lot the old folks are full of stories and often have nobody to tell them to One old man worked for GMs defense division back in the day and helped design the M1 Abrams tank and he had a little wooden version of the tank on a plaque-stand that had his name and the teams name and was basically a thank-you-for-your-work gift from the company Another woman had been a dancer on Broadway back in the late 50s and early 60s and she had all these old newspaper clippings She eventually became a teacher in a town south of Houston and had some great stories from that time as well Unfortunately I havent been there in a little while I got a place of my own at the end of 2018 and kept visiting but then they locked down pretty hard back in March of 2020 and then my grandmother caught Covid and passed back in February so theres not much to take me back there now that theyre opening up again I hope theyre all well but I think that at least a handful of the folks I really liked there have passed in the last year,JamesEarlDavyJones,16193934530,1

Hold up Im still trying to get a cardiac panel in ICU and then I need to go to the OR real quick and gowned up to draw another cardiac panel But the person shadowing me couldnt go get any of those draws It was all about how I couldnt keep up I barely had my bearings of the hospital and their system was ancient and then covid hitI was working SIX twelve hour shifts and my 6th shift was a double so 16 hoursmind you Im home schooling 35 kids at home and dealing with being shadowed at workI was in tears nearly every day So I was told one shift "so tomorrow will you need to be shadowed again? Or will you show up and actually be able to do your job" and I said "I dont need to be shadowed! I need help! I cant do all these draws I was 17 draws behind all day!" And she sent me in tears to draw a BABY and said when I got back we were going to talk to the director of the lab! When in the office with the director she pretty much told me if I couldnt keep up then maybe it wasnt a good fit I said "If this is how you treat your employees then i would never let my family member be cared for here!" She told me that I should be proud to work there as we were one of the first hospitals to start caring for covid patients (without enough PPE) and to get out of her office I took that was it wasnt a good fit I meant to leave my badge on the clerks desk on my way out but I ended up dropping it and throwing it at her computer screen I was embarrassed I was crying so I just left I made a formal complaint up to the director of health services about how I and 3 other trainees were treated and they claimed to have done an investigation and found my claims to be unfounded They didnt talk to either of the other trainees Funny I can draw 140 patients on my first day in out patient because 3 local clinics were closed for the day and they were all bused to the location I worked atbut I couldnt keep up with 175 bedswasnt safe to me or the patients,Feenfurn,16207060390,46

By the 2nd week I was one of the last three of travelers that started with me The day they tried to assign me 8 patients the day the charge nurse got fed up and said "goodbye Im done with this place" and just walked off at change of shift I was like yeah no and told my recruiter fuck this noise and dont contact me again And then I left and found a hospital down the road that shockingly had no staffing issues When I told them which hospital I had just left they said "oh you mean Fatal Valley?" Which rhymes with the name of the facility And I quickly learned it had a reputation even pre covid,rawrr_monster,16206960490,183

gxq2awr,n9jyqk,Holiday Inn I was already familiar with the Opera system they use to check people in and it wasnt much in terms of training By the end of the day I was already teaching whoever was training me ways they could use Opera differently This was this past Jan 2021 and so throughout the interview I had a couple of COVID policies that I wanted to make sure they were following They told me everything I wanted to hear and I was lied to so that they could get me on board I only wanted to work the night audit from Sunday to Thursday they completely understood So I start with one PM shift to train then Ill start night audit Nope The first moment of work theyre giving out schedules and tellin me Im working PM shifts and morning shifts No night audit shifts Strike one When the time came for the person training me to go on break they decided to take an hour and a half I had a line of guests piling up and was able to take care of all of them without coworkers help When I went to look for them in the back they were just watching Family Guy with their feet up Not a care I tell them theres a line and theyre like "oh you got it" Strike two When this mfr finally came back out they had no mask on and started talking about how they love to troll people on Facebook with political posts while they were talking their spit flew outta their mouth and landed on my hand Strike three I called the manager and told them Im leaving early because I wasnt expecting to work a full shift on my first day The next day I called and told them Im not coming in and that I quit This was such a difficult choice to make as I was struggling financially and found the job immediately into my job search To say no to a solution that presented itself so quickly to my problems felt like I was a choosing beggar but I knew that I deserved much more respect than I was getting and staying would have turned me into something awful,peezyyyyy,16207377910,3
gxqcys1,n9jyqk,Not immediately on the first day but during probation I was told that it would be senior position in a consultancy and that I would be expected to handle clients ftf being that it was an on-site role and would return to the main office one day per week Covid struck and I had to start my first week on wfh arrangement with minimal training I was okay with that but the team lead basically had never met me in person and she thought I was not a good fit for the job so she made me copy her in every email even though my buddy had already okayed the email Instructions passed down was a mess and every now and then the team lead would call me abruptly to yell at me on the phone I basically lived in fear at her name popping up on the screen I was not a quitter until my probation review came up and the team lead basically took the opportunity to dress me down it was humiliating and I had no chance of rebuttal since she was the only manager I knew and had zero interactions with any staff in the main office My communications were basically restricted to the very small team which she led and no senior management at all and I basically felt so isolated I started looking for a new job after that and she scheduled me for a meeting with hr thereafter to let me know they would not be continuing my employment after my probation Instead of feeling ashamed at basically being asked to leave I felt a sense of relief at not having to interact with her again I later learnt from HR during the exit interview that I was not the first team member to leave from her team in such a way and the longest member stayed for only a year,reallyYthis,16207428920,3
gxqi7e5,n9jyqk,I had just finished all my training testing and schooling to get my Nursing Home Administration license when I started interviewing for jobs I THOUGHT I nailed a great gig to get started I was already really questioning my choice to be in the field (24/7 responsibility high stress) but the building I was going to run was small and Ive been there before In my interviews I asked all the right questions about what I can expect in terms of my management team the hours Id need to put in how they were managing COVID what their turnover had been etc so far it seemed like something a new admin like me could take on! So I got the job moved across the country back home and I drove to the facility to get started First red flag: the home is storing their dishes outside to dry What? Weird Ill change that Second Red Flag: Their COVID log book has pages all over in the lobby Scattered on the floor most only halfway filled in An employee walks in and sees some little blonde girl and makes a joke "Dont worry you dont need to sign that I always forget anyways" Third Red Flag: I meet the guy whos been helping out and covering the admin role until I could arrive Hes exhausted and SO excited that Im here Like beyond relieved Fourth Red Flag: He gives me a tour of the facility and immediately I had to change briefs had to stop someone from falling and was groped Im talking 30 minutes into being there Im normally very happy to help but I saw 1 aide in the building AT ALL and she looked worn to the bone Fourth Red Flag: There are holes in the walls parts of the ceiling are exposed and Im no electrician but visible wires in a nursing home are a HUGE violation Fifth Red Flag: Not only is the building incredibly short staffed (when I asked the man giving me the tour he told me a good day has 50% of our legally required staff) but I found I would be sharing my management team with another facility This is unheard of Your management team is everything and theyve been driving between this facility and another one an hour away for the past year Sixth Res Flag: Though I was told COVID had not been in this building there were current active cases with management and nursing out on quarantine They didnt know how many residents could have had it by now :( Seventh Red Flag: When my training boss showed up we talked and I directly said: "We both can see this place is not running well How many hours do you think Ill need to put in each day to manage this?" Remember his response in interviews and follow-ups was always "Oh your typical 7-5 with rare weekend coverage" NOW hes saying "Oh well I think the minimum will be 14 hour days on weekends as well for at least the next 6 months" At this point I realized Id been bamboozled I let him know I was no longer interested in the position and I left It felt like I was in a horror movie My adrenaline has never been at such a high Since then I moved back to Houston and decided to become a nurse That experience burned me on being an NHA and I want to move on with my life TL:DR; I was going to be the administrator of a nursing home and in the interview and follow-ups I was lied to about every question I asked When I got there the red flags involving COVID and staffing lead me to quit,wazzledazzle,16207451460,3

Right before covid kicked off I had just moved to a new country and I was desperate for a job I answered a job listing on a shady website for "marketing" The description was very vague but what was included in the description sort of made it seem like the position would be an office job with 9-5 hours So I do the interview and got the job Fast forward to my first day: the four other new hires that I was supposed to start with all did the old no call no show Red flags already going off I cant have been the only one to miss something Five minutes into my first day the boss says this is door-to-door sales commission only An hour later Im shadowing another guy and watching as he literally scams a woman who cant speak English into signing this deal the company promotes earning himself a commission Strikes 12 and 3 But I figure "fuck it Im already halfway through the day I might as well stick it out until the end" As the day goes on the guy Im shadowing gets about 7 people scammed and unfortunately the only reason these people are susceptible is because this is a horrible part of a crime ridden city and most of the residents of this area in particular cannot speak English so they quite literally have no idea whats happening Yet another big red flag that something is wrong Finally the last straw as if the exploitation of the poor and susceptible wasnt enough we end up knocking on a crazy mans door and he walks out onto his porch brandishing a fucking pistol and waiving it in the fucking air pointing the damn thing in every single direction - at me the guy Im with himself his house passing cars in the street Everything about this situation is screaming accidental murder-suicide I calmly meet him at his level of comprehension going along with the crazy talk to keep him engaged as my "partner" and I back away and walk around the corner out of sight He says "close call" and I say "fuck you Im leaving" Walked to a service station and caught an Uber all the way home Didnt even make a dime The fucking boss had the audacity to ask me for the company shirt back the next day For anyone who might be curious the marketing firm was called "victory marketing LLC" And they were contracted by SFE energy to solicit their gas supply plan to residential homes Similar outfits run under the name "vista energy" It was a total scam that preyed on the vulnerable Disgusting people,Meth-is-good-for-ya,16207059250,2

gxsnzsi,n9jyqk,There was a job prospect during October of last year where I was called for an interview at 10am I was wearing high heels eye makeup (mask meant no lipstick or anything) jewellery a nice blouse and trousers I got there the owner had me fill out an application sheet then gave me a VERY brief tour of their shop He then proceeded to walk me over to where they punch in for shifts pulled out a sheet which already had my name on it punched me in and said "go work Walk around help customers if you have any questions ask another member of staff" And at this point Im like wait what? This was just an interview my roommate is expecting me back and you never even asked my availability? I guess I am missing class today?? I am in heels?? And before I could say anything he said "we close at 10pm youll get a 30 minute lunch break Go work" And that was it I being too much of a pushover and thinking they must really need people decided to stay and finish the shift I was there for just under 12 hours The owner would yell at workers when we would ask customers to put on a mask (the mandate in our city) and/or let him know that we are far over capacity and would get shut down if a health official walked in he had no care for any of his staffs safety I even asked a worker who bless her heart had been there for three years when they clean and sanitise everything and she just said "we dont Ive asked him multiple times but we dont have anything for us to clean with" He wanted me back the next morning at 9am but I had class at noon Plus I had a panic attack on the way home thinking that I was going to get my roommate and myself sick I called the next morning and said "I am not coming when can I get my check" TL:DR Job "hired" me basically the moment I walked in the door and had me work a 115 hr shift in heels (interview outfit) and apparently doesnt think covid is a thing so they dont enforce safety rules or any sort of cleaning schedule Noped out of there real quick right after that shift,BlackRose-etSilence,16207785900,2
gxqde9j,n9jyqk,This just happened a month or two ago actually!! I started at a local pet store chain and was really excited! I love animals and Ive been struggling to get out of restaurants for the past several years so this just seemed like a great place for me! I show up for my first day about 10 minutes early which is standard for me The manager isnt there yet so the other cashier starts showing me around and all seems well Then she tells me when no customers are in the store you dont need to wear a mask (meanwhile Im in there wearing two masks) Shes about two feet away from me maskless and Im just like uhhhhhh panicking a little inside A customer walks in wearing a MAGA hat and criticizes the need to sanitize the scoops for bulk dog treats and starts spewing covid misinformation and me having to patience for that shit started arguing with him but the other cashier was taking his side In walks the manager (30 minutes late) and she starts showing me how to stock some cat food I just go about that for a while and ignore all the other staff walking around without masks while standing close together After a hour or so the manager asks if I want to take my break I say sure and head out When I come back the manager says that for a 10 hour shift you just get a 30 minute unpaid break and if theres only two people working you have to stay on premise and help while on your break if needed After that I told the manager to pay me for my two hours and I wasnt coming back $13/hour to deal with maskless co-workers do customer service nonsense and maybe work through a break during a 10 hour shift isnt worth it especially during a damn pandemic,greenestbean143,16207430800,3

h5hmoyw,olgt7p,My wife was invited to be the maid of honor at her best friends wedding For months she slaved over the planning and execution of nearly everything involved It was for a lesbian couple both worked under my wife in the same company for years One of them was noticeably out of her mind crazy and I couldnt stand her The other was pretty chill! I had chosen to not attend even though I was invited simply because I cannot for the life of me stand the one bride I mean shes bad Like the kinda person you cant be within 10 feet of for more than a minute without losing your mind Well the wedding was being held at the crazy brides mothers house A HUGE 10 bedroom disgustingly large house They of course invited their closest friends 5-6 of them most from the same office to come over and hang a few hours before the wedding was to take place So they all showed up including my wife the maid of honor 4 hours before the ceremony Well! None of them came dressed up! Including my wife So an hour or two before things were to begin they all decided to go get dressed up and the mother DEMANDS they all leave and go elsewhere to do it as it would somehow be unlucky for them to dress up in the same house as the brides???! And the bride of the crazy mother says nothing Deer in headlights kinda look on her face All of them being an hour or more from home all ended up getting dressed up and doing their makeup in a 711 BATHROOM switching out with customers as it was a single room She told me it was beyond embarrassing Then to make things worse the mother demand that my wife their maid of honor not be standing near them while they were saying their vows but rather pulled up an extra chair into the room at the very back behind the guests where she was to stay seated for the entire ceremony I was LIVID! A lot of my own money went into decorating n whatnot As well as a nice expensive gift! Ack! My wife ended up making the nearly 2 hour drive home later that evening crying the entire way In the end they moved in together December of 2019 right after getting married With covid they were house bound and couldnt escape one another They divorced in August of last year after hardly 11 months The really cool one of the two brides ended it saying they were better as friends than lovers That the other was "insufferable",Gunslinger1814,16265025050,7

h5g4onr,olgt7p,So before I start this is right before everything shut down due to COVID so here goes My family was there for the bride who I had never met but I was at home for the week and thought why not? This was a mistake The wedding ceremony went and was really your run-of-the-mill ceremony except the groom was crying like I am totally for emotions being shown but there was obviously something very very wrong (also important to note that they had had two children which is fine but both had conservative families so yeah) This is where it goes downhill We go to the reception at this venue and we are doing okay until the toast where the groom is still crying like a lot (how do you keep crying for this long? Easily over 2 hours) the toast was okay nothing memorable and then we start the party right? Drinks now flow like water Well someone liked their drink a bit too much The groom then drank quite a bit was harassing some of the women of the bridal party (we learned this after the fact) just fell into a table full of food that the BRIDES parents were at then got into a drunk-shoving-match with the best man that just happened to be his brother I live across the world now for which I am very grateful they are still together from what Ive heard but the relationship hasnt been healthy (who woulda thought?),sagey1,16264721310,4
h5gk51o,olgt7p,Well I know these people well and this was a surprise to me The groom told the bride a few months before the wedding (April 2021) that a honeymoon would not be safe due to COVID and they should save The next week he told the future bride he was going on a trip for two weeks with his groomsmen to Puerto Rico (they live in California) and would be back a couple days before the wedding,Juiceman4you,16264797060,3

h5hygi5,olgt7p,I have two younger sisters The older of the two got engaged in August 2019 They had been together for 13 years since high school and now early 30s The younger sister is in college and the Maid of Honor The wedding was set for October 2020 For several months the MOH apparently had done nothing to plan anything My mother chalks it up to her "being a college student" So right off the bat my sister and fianc are pissed that she is not doing anything the MOH is supposed to do Then COVID started My younger sister has to move home take classes online wearing a mask at work (Starbucks) and now cant see her friends And I guess she was having mental health problems prior to all that anyways One day in May 2020 (actually MY wedding anniversary) Im FaceTiming my father and the younger one pops in all excited and says "LOOK I CUT MY HAIR!!" She had COMPLETELY buzzed her entire hair off after having mid back lengthed hair since she was a little girl But it looked my she was enlisting in the army but it was done in the dark I look at her and was in shock I didnt know what to say A few hours later my older sister says to get on Skype to a group video chat with my younger sister My older sister and fianc are looking into the camera like they are planning a murder Needless to say this was a big deal The following day my two sisters met and the older one had a long letter that she read to her saying how she is disappointed etc A few months pass and the younger one says she will wear a wig The older sister and fianc agree By the end of the summer 2020 and they decide to move the wedding to October 2021 because of COVID MOH still has apparently "done nothing" But its clear she is keeping her short hair which has grown in now and she has it styled nicely Now its 3 months until the wedding and the younger one is refusing to wear the wig (she never ordered one) But my sister and her fianc are so adamant about her wearing one that my mother is calling me for advice of what they should do The older sister and fianc are complaining that everyone will have "down dos" except her (there way more to it than that - like the younger one always gets away with stuff without thinking of the consequences) while my mom says the younger one is not feeling loved for her being her These events have caused a whole rift in the family dynamic My wife and I have nicknamed it HAIRGATE SCANDAL My younger sister and the fianc used to have a great relationship - like getting funny or meaningful gifts for Xmas Now its awkward at best One hand we (edit: my parents not we/me) want my younger sister to feel loved and appreciated on the other hand its my sisters (edit: their daughters) WEDDING Lets see what happens Oh also the fiancs mom is requesting they change the wedding venue 3 months out! Edit: appreciate the feedback I personally think its ridiculous to try to make someone wear a wig for any occasion,daridge2380,16265127140,3

h4k65gp,og6dcv,Alone in my house eating Costco chicken soup I took a big bite of chicken and was cleaning up and putting things away took a big breath through my mouth Down went the chicken I choked! I looked around the kitchen realising I am alone Wtf am I going to do ? Panicked a bit Grabbed cell phone desperately trying to get air in tried to call 911 the damn thing lost signal I had two thoughts One if I can make it to the front door out to the street maybe someone would help but probably not Two run into the kitchen sink and drop my knees To get the chicken out I am an Er nurse and was expected to work the next two days no one would get worried if it had been 24 hours and they didnt hear from me I mean work would be slightly pissed I no called no showed for shift but they wouldnt send a search party I am going to die in my kitchen alone and no one would know for 48 hours I put as much force as I could to both ram my body against that sink and then drop my knees it took two tries but it worked I was so very happy when it came up My body hurt like hell and I was sore from trying to breathe and the process to free the chicken However I am alive!! The next 12 months were about the same as the kitchen experience January I got mastoiditis both sides of my skull 4 months later I got bilateral COVID pneumonia and gave it to my family I almost lost my mother We all survived Battered but survived I should absolutely be dead I dont forget that fact I try really hard I am in no way perfect to live life as if it were my last and at the end of that day I ask myself if I would be proud of myself if that was my last day on earth?

h4j8g4i,og6dcv,After a series of unfortunate events and major life stressors my boyfriend and I ended up living in a Chevy short ( school) bus with our two dogs and cat We were staying on his brothers property and there were steep forested hills on both sides of the bus and a creek that ran behind The hill had been logged many years before so aside from second growth redwoods there was enormous fir trees that all grew hundreds of feet tall competing for sunlight some wider than a tire It was February and we had some storms previously but the morning was sunny with a slight breeze My boyfriend had left for work and I was feeding our dogs Ren and koko breakfast getting ready to take them on a hike I was brushing my hair and heard a noise like snapping wood and at first I thought it was his brother or a neighbor working outside but then i leaned down and looked out the window of the passenger door and saw one of those old fir trees horizontal in mid air I slid to the floor It happened so fast it impacted the bus There wasnt time to do anything or say anything I thought that was it everything stopped I think I had clenched my eyes closed as I hit the floor right as it impacted The sound of crushing metal the windows all blew out and glass every where When I realized I was alive still I just started crying and screaming WTF OMG?!?! Over and over and over again My dog koko had her leg trapped between the roof and the bed and I struggled to free her and the passenger door was jammed shut and I was able to open it just about 7" and koko ran out All I could think was to get to the back of the bus to find Ren I force squeezed myself out the cracked door and scrambled under the tree to the back door RIP Ren dizzle  the tree fell right on her and its something I will never forget We spent the whole day with the help of many people removing the tree so we could burry her and salvaging our belongings We spent the next four years living there in fear and on the four year anniversary another tree fell on the cabin we were living in late at night during a storm I realized it wasnt a matter of if but when a tree would fall and kill one of us of all of us We spent a month living in my BFs car and then we finally moved to an affordable place during covid lockdown It still brings me to tears Im terrified of the wind/storms/trees I spent a lot of time thinking what if I did this or that but there just wasnt any time at all I lost a lot of sleep and had many nightmares I felt like every summer I would start to heal and then winter would come and it was really just a two step forwards and one step back kind of healing I still think what if I did this or that differently but I know thats not healthy No one could have survived where that tree fell and there was no time do do anything differently It cut though that bus like a hot butter knife I will never be the same and just telling this has me in tears and filled with anxiety RIP Ren ,Herbessence,16257884660,2

h4jvlpd,og6dcv,I have many times almost been greeted by death I dont mean "wow dodged that one" I mean my brain released the DMT (or whatever it is) saying "its time my dude itll be ok" I mean I was in really bad shape No fluids No food Very sick I remember needing to pee REALLY bad getting half way up and just chilling back down Not collapsing but the "wow Im tired really tired Im just gonna" and then I was warm Happy Relaxed Id been in pain for a month Doctors say I was stupid close to death but this is the US so you dont just casually stroll into the hospital on a "maybe this is bad" because at 24 I was barely making rent I thought of everyone that would be sad when I died which I knew was mere seconds away and before I could even complete that thought "itll be fine everyone will be ok Just chill Enjoy the warmth" kind of feeling I can tell you very few people have lived to experience that sensation My wife gets upset when Im not upset at her for something she did that was wrong because thats stupid Itd waste our time Why worry about it? She didnt mean it and all that jazz Move forward from it Ive learned a lot from that moment I fell asleep after that For some reason I didnt have to pee anymore and I didnt really*feel* anything Nothing bad anyways Just the first truly peaceful sleep in years upon years Ive been in chronic pain since I was 18 I felt none of it if only briefly I remember fully relaxing and then warmth The sun I was awake I had walking pneumonia Suppressed immune system and nothing to fight it That morning I felt immensely better I mean not up and about but I mean leaps and bounds from the previous 16 years My lungs will never be the same Ill always have issues but they arent major I caught walking pneumonia again when I caught COVID Hospital shrugged it off and sent me home One of my doctors (I have several Im a walking medical problem) was suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuper pissed "Fuck those god damn piece of shit doctors Im going to prescribe you this -- if you arent significantly better in 24 hours come to see me and Ill admit you myself" (much larger city compared to my dinky ass town) That was a very rough month and a half of which is purely a foggy memory Like that feeling you get when you VERY FIRST wake up in the morning Ive also had two or three heart attacks open heart carotid clogged kidney stones (let me tell you when you pee blood at 20 you get scared I dont mean a little red I mean a god damn fountain of blood) Perhaps you want a vehicle accident? I had an 18-wheeler exiting wrong and nail me t-bone me back up the ramp facing the wrong way It was 0530 -- on my way to my morning workout (only reason Im alive with heart issues but alive) Time is important -- grass was wet from morning dew I know enough gaming to know not to overcompensate and how to mitigate as best I could Nothing quite says "oh shit" quite like staring at yet another 18 wheeler barreling at you Evaded that barely No major injuries Lost a fair bit of techie stuff from it though How the SUV I was in didnt roll is beyond me and the police Turned out 18 wheeler dude goofed HARD I dont remember the details but he basically sucked over many lanes with traffic exiting 65mph I had no where to go My v6 couldnt speed up fast enough to dodge difficult to tell if brakes would line me up or make me head on so I gambled and held on to the wheel and just let off the gas and just let the car coast in its spins I have lived a very non-boring life And lately yet again I think medically its about to get "exciting" again but not in the happy sense of the word but well see Cant seem to catch a break but who said life is fair anyways Im already on many measures of borrowed time I wish I could get my wife to understand that Appreciate what you got Or dont Its up to you and no one else Want to numb your pain with drugs? Fine I wont judge Want to get through it and get better? Rock on I think I finally understand like really understand we all work with what we have not many of us are bad people Youd be surprised how much of our country works on the honor system more than we realize And I think thats hope Edit: I need to find a picture Its a picture of a man with a box? And it says your bodys last hoorah lighting up its cigarette is giving you DMT Its your bodies way of saying "its been fun hasnt it?

Your gallbladder was rotting!" wtf? He is way too calm and starts talking about how the doctor got in (laproscopic) and everything was cool until she started removing it and it began to disolve and fall apart I was told if I had any other doctor I would have woken up with a huge new incision because "Shed the best and she barely got it out before it fell apart" My doctor comes in at this point and is all friendly but yawning and lot and confirms all of this is true although she humbly adds "It was probably just luck I got it out like that" (Gee thanks) Im numb in pain and very confused but they want to go ahead and send me home (COVID after all) so they do so and my stepmom gently guides me into the car To be fair I did heal beautifully My scars are tiny and hard to see no hernias no trouble at all But at the follow up my surgeon admitted that she thinks another week would have pushed me into a rupture and much more severe surgery,SeaOkra,16257622120,1

gxc9ifu,n79n8y,Covid I was raised around a bunch of hardcore conspiracy theorist preppers so the moment a WHISPER of covid came around my entire family told me to go to the store and stock up I had TP medicine baby wipes bottles of water and lots of canned and boxed food all ready and set in my house a solid two months before it even made major news I even had a stockpile of cloth masks My family all did the same My therapist said hed never seen me as calm and relaxed as when covid actually started and we quarantined,girllock,16204362820,1222

gxc4w26,n79n8y,COVID - Husband and I both grew up poor food for my family was always a question of having enough So as an adult my husband and I since we got together have kept a well stock pantry of at least a months worth of dry/canned goods Fresh produce we substitute from our small garden every summer (adding a greenhouse this year for our growing family) Not only that but I always have a stock of toilet paper so when everyone was out and looking for it we still have a decent amount Couple that with purchasing a bidet January 2020 we never ran out of TP I also keep an emergency stash of TP in each of our cars This year I am working on building our first aid supplies That way if hospitals become overrun we will at least have some basic things at home Oh and go take a first aid class you never know when you might need some of the skills they teach,wsclose,16204337140,96
gxcafof,n79n8y,COVID You are all going to think I am fucking crazy but for years I had a recurring dream about a deadly virus I was paranoid about running out of food as soon as we bought a house with a basement I started buying meat in bulk and canned food that would keep At the end of Dec 2019 my husband brought up about how Pandemics hit every 100 years and by March the store shelves were empty We couldnt even find any fucking fresh bananas pasta etc My 200lbs of beef chicken and frozen salmon all the peaches green beans pears etc that I canned didnt seem so fucking nuts to my husband all of a sudden I also happened to have bread flour and yeast We were fine I think if I went into the grocery store and had empty shelves I would have gone into a tailspin,CockatielConner,16204368040,36
gxbwthp,n79n8y,Honestly this whole pandemic I have struggled with severe germophobia my whole life and as a little kid I found out what a pandemic was and was really scared of the idea of one happening at some point within my lifetime The more I read up on pandemics and their history as I grew up and lived with that fear the more likely I came to feel it was When Covid was just a thing in Wuhan I had heard it could be transmissible for weeks before it showed any signs and symptoms and in the modern day of fast worldwide travel constantly occurring on a mass scale I right away felt like theres no way this thing wont become as uncontained as possible in no time I right away started to say that it was going to spread worldwide be a serious issue and that people here (in the States) wouldnt handle it well or act reasonably and would panic and buy everything off of the shelves at first and then immediately not take it seriously at all and call you weak if you do take it seriously Every one I know laughed at me rolled their eyes and told me Im a crazy germaphobe And then literally every single last detail of every single thing thats happened here in the US - from how bad it got exactly to the early panic buying days to the politicizing of the virus and the way Trump used that to his advantage to how long its been around and how things might start wrapping up and getting back to normal a bit if we can vaccinate - all happened EXACTLY the way I called it play by play like a year and some months ago So idk if Id call everything thats happened unlikely really but at the mental level (and even partially the level of resources/taking precautions the experts tell us to take well before the experts began to tell us to take them - I already had masks/etc and was social distancing before that was a thing here) Ive kinda been gearing up for this my whole life in some ways,PaleontologistNo7501,16204293910,1188

gxdijro,n79n8y,Covid specifically my parents indiscipline selfishness and immaturity infecting our entire family with covid if they came back to our country for home leave They are great in some ways toxic or incompetent in others but this is something I warned them about I broke things down for them into bite sized pieces to explain how they will infect us and basically reduce us into prisoners for a month And how they will not learn their lesson and do stupid shit like getting a haircut from a barber the day after they get a negative test result I told them they should not come to our country until things were under control and instead enjoy the freedom of their embassy compound Enjoy the fact they can go to the gym order whatever go for morning walks with their friends but dont come here because you wont be able to sit inside and only go out for essentials Forget infecting people that arent our family they couldnt even show enough care to not risk the health of their siblings and their own children And for what? Did my dad need urgent work completed? No Did my mother need urgent health checkups? No All because they wanted to be religious tourists and travel to visit a fucking temple out of state using public transport Now after their own parents siblings and children are still criticising them for their lack of empathy intelligence and discipline have they learnt their lesson? Nope And guess who knew this was gonna happen back in February of 2020 after Italy and Spain were ravaged? And guess who only watched Indian conservative propoganda news instead of listening to their relatives actually living here I have a 6 year old cousin with her parents that lives in our extended family home with us and sure kids arent really in danger but who in their right mind willingly takes that bet just so they can live like their teenagers despite being over 50 Like wtf My cousin showed more patience and understanding then them My younger brother has fever for a week and 50% of the idiot couple had breathing difficulties needing special medicine and multiple in house doctor visits and still 0% of the stupid couple learnt And idk Ive heard of parents calling their kids stupid or thinking they are but growing up knowing your parents are incompetent and toxic and can theoretically do this vs actually seeing them do this surpass even the most likely scenario in your head and give you a fucking BINGO in the extreme things my parents can do doesnt feel satisfying Its just sad,throwthrowthrowho,16204706850,5

gxceoux,n79n8y,Not so much a particular scenario but Ive said for a few years now that something big was coming I had a general unease about the world for a year or two before covid19 hit I didnt see a pandemic coming I thought it would be more a global conflict The world seemed to be getting angrier but the pandemic blind sided me My view is still that something bigger is coming I think a huge cyber attack or something Id love aliens to appear it would mean wed fast put all our global differences aside and work together to either work alongside or repel any threat Sadly I think well do ourselves over before thats a possibility,kkrash79,16204392170,3
gxcqyiy,n79n8y,Mine pertains to side effects of coronavirus vaccines Before I got vaccinated I did a very thorough research of potential side effects especially those not officially mentioned on the list that you see when you sign up to get vaccinated The list only mentions minor side effects like the usual headache joint and muscle pain fever and of course the injection site pain/swelling aka "covid arm" What they dont mention are stuff like swollen lymph nodes screwed up menstrual cycles numbness/tingling sensations nose bleeds diarrhea vertigo tinnitus heart palpitations and other horrific things that people over at https://wwwredditcom/r/CovidVaccinated/new/ mention The first thing I did was make sure I was well hydrated days before the appointment Im a heavy drinker of water and juice so no problem with that Next I read that moving and exercising the arm youre gonna get injected at can reduce the stinging pain a lot as it would allow the vaccine to spread more easily and be absorbed I only ate mandarin fruits the night before the vaccination so that I can poop it out before the appointment so when the shot takes effect I wont have anything to really vomit or poop out As for the heart palpitations I practiced deep breathing in order to force my heart to beat slower I wasnt alone on the vaccination day Its actually my family who signed me up (they have all of my documents) and they were underestimating the side effects I kept warning them to be careful and not treat this like any kind of previous vaccines weve had because there are many negative side effect reports that werent listed I urged them to buy Tylenol because who knows how severe the vaccine will affect us Day of the vaccine we all got our shots Just as I expected within 30 minutes my injection site down to my elbow started to get a numb/tingling feeling like when you sleep on your arm in a bad way I immediately forced my arm to move around and massaged it There was also the stinging pain of course but I forced it anyway until the feeling subsided I also had the headache which lasted for hours but thankfully probably due to me drinking so much water and juice the pain was just comparable to working in front of the computer for a whole day something Im very used to I also had chills and fever but I was prepared and it didnt really bother me that much because Ive felt worse before Up to this day I still havent opened up my bottle of Tylenol because the pain never got to the point that made me desperate for a pain reliever I was only sick for 2 days On the other hand my family members who underestimated the side effects ended up taking Tylenol because they couldnt bear the pain Imagine if I didnt tell them to buy Tylenol they probably would have sent me out to buy it for them Its always better to overprepare for something than be caught helpless later on,Adeno,16204464860,3
gxd0th5,n79n8y,In 2017 I got this strange urge that there may come a day when I wont be able to see concerts Since that summer I purchased tickets to probably 30-50 shows a year for the next 3 years spanning all genres I obsessed over crossing musicians off of my list of "artists to see before they or I die" I got to see a majority of the artists I put on that list Then covid happened and wow am I glad the 3 years leading up to it were completely stuffed with shows Looking back it seems irrational as to why at that time I would think shows would ever stop But I truly think something or someone guided me into absolutely going all out and I dont regret any of it,link88140,16204537720,3
gxd12r5,n79n8y,March last year I called my surgery together for a meeting I explained I felt we were at extreme risk of covid as our job involved being covered in body fluids I had already stocked up on N95 and other PPE a month earlier and watched as collegues were unable to work due to a world wide shortage I told my staff that I hadnt had a holiday for two years and was going to take the next month off to prepare and suggested to anyone else to take time off if they wish I showed my indian nurse how to disconnect our oxygen supply and told her to take it home if required rather than try and attempt to seek help at the hospital My daughter was in the final year of high school and asked me what were my thoughts I told her I expect the country to lockdown for 6 weeks to control the outbreaks then once managed they will lockdown smaller centres such as towns or even suburbs by limiting movement from further outbreaks until every case could be identified and tracked I told her her exams will be fine and to prepare for university to start on time 14 months later my staff dont question anything I say and are grateful to be working full time in an otherwise normal situation My daughter was accepted into university on a full scholarship after achieving full marks,RogerSterlingsFling,16204539880,3

gxdjo6b,n79n8y,Before COVID hit I had Amazon subscriptions running for toiletry products to make sure we never ran out - mainly toilet paper paper towels and hand soap I didnt calibrate the frequency so we had a TON of hand soap and toilet paper sitting in our storage I even made a comment to my wife that we had way too much and I should pause the subscription Then COVID hit Patted myself on the shoulder for overstocking,wongcode,16204717140,3
gxdu7v3,n79n8y,Toilet paper I was once watching a tv show where the main characters traveled to a post apocalyptic timeline Their post apocalyptic selves grabbed them by the shoulders and said firmly "hoard toilet paper like its gold Dont worry about food or water just toilet paper" and I thought to myself thats actually a good idea So for about 18 months EVERY time I went to the grocery store I made a habit of getting toilet paper If I went to Costco Id get a huge pack regular grocery store Id get a standard 8 pack It quickly piled up and I started storing it in the corner of my home office and bedroom The wife thought I was nuts Then covid happened remember the toilet paper shortage?

gxe0s8o,n79n8y,Covid Two years ago from December 2019 to Jan 2020 when cases had only just begun hitting China I recalled the SARS crisis of my childhood in Singapore also precipitated by a mysterious incurable virus emerging from China I remembered robot sanitisers everywhere centralised household distributions of provisions and medical supplies temperature checks before entering public places third to fourth degree contact tracing of SARS victims and so on - and knew none of these would take place in an organised non-shambolic fashion early on or ever in the UK I noped it out of the UK immediately and just as I predicted the UK under Bojo completely failed to handle it leading to mass deaths (although its vaccination programme at the end was a saving grace) Asian cities (Singapore Tokyo Seoul Taipei HK) are a good place to be for cleanliness efficiency and safety And fun and normalcy during the pandemic - everything mostly carried on as per normal For perspective Singapore Taiwan and New Zealand have about 05 deaths per 100K people South Korea has about 4 deaths per 100K people Japan has about 8 deaths per 100K people and the UK and USA have about 200 deaths per 100K people,mfabbytwailfr,16204832760,3
gxe3xyk,n79n8y,I panicked about Brexit and stocked up on canned goods and then remembered the episode of Supernatural where in a post-apocalyptic environment toilet paper was like gold dust so i bulk ordered six extra packs and put them under the spare room bed and thought nothing of it It turned out to be just enough to get us comfortably through the covid toilet paper panic So my overthinking for one situation got us safely through another unexpected one! :),7keys1quest,16204849650,3
gxe5s7j,n79n8y,Im always carrying a bunch of stuff in my backpack I could be pills (Acetamonophen ibuprophen benadryl) a ziploc bag of tissue a tote bag an oversize thick plastic bag bandaid masking tape small mesuring tape a single shoe lace I found on the ground (not kidding always told myself it could be useful) and a cleaning rag Ive started doing this in secondary school then college then adult life (Same backpack too Ive been carrying it for 13 years I take care of my stuff) --- Why do one need a cleaning rag in his bag? Because you never know One time we were doing a team project in college my friend spilled her coffee on the table I was a matter of time before our documents were soaked Low and behold me the guy always ready for everything pull out my rag and saved the day A few weeks prior to that event still in college I arrive early to my class like always Suddenly one guy whos usually always late came early dropped his bag and rush out since he needed to get his project from the computer at the other end of the building (cause he didnt do it the night before I guess he liked being late) However we had a policy keep the room clean no dirt of melted snow on the floor We are in Quebec and there was snow outside so our boots got all dirty and leave water on the floor and there are folks who dont wear boots and switch to shoes inside instead they just wear shoes and make the place dirty So the guy was rushing and saw the mess he left on the ground in panic he had to get his project on his drive plus wipe the floor before the teacher arrived in the class/studio You know what happens next I pull out my trusty little rag and wipe the floor clean saving the guys fate --- Why do one need a small mesuring tape in his bag? Because you never know We had an evaluation in one of my classes in college we had to reproduce a shoe box a real one we had in the class and animate it in C4D in a matter of time Most people just eyeball it make a rectangular box and calls it a day I cannot simply do some random shape it said "reproduction" I needed the mesurements We were post-production students not the kind of folks who carry the means to mesure object in their daily lives except for me of course cause Im the weird one always ready for everything So I pulled out my mesuring tape at the start of the class before people arrived except for the teacher he was always early and proceed to get the right mesurement from the physical box and thus got a perfect shape for my CG shoebox 96% on that evaluation way higher than most people --- Winter coat Its necessary if you live in Canada A few years ago I got myself one with loads of pockets I love pockets you can store all sorts of things in there A zipploc bag full of tissues a reflecting high visibility bracer spare coins if you need to take the bus and got no cards or no spare change in your pocket and what about a spare set of gloves? I already have a pair of glove why two? Because you never know Still in college we are doing a project where we first needed to film some good looking shots during the night cause we needed night lights on buildings and such So its a winter night a beautiful one too with thick slow falling snow and fridgid air However one guy in our team didnt prepped as well as he thought he forgot to bring gloves and we kinda needed fingers to operate a DSLR You know the drill they knew the drill surprise secondary pair of gloves directly from yours truly Saved him from his demise of frozen fingers --- Congratulation you have been invited to a party in a shack resort friends and frendly coworker will be making a potlock! I hate food waste I grew up in the country side and was frugal before I even knew it was a thing If a group of adult in their late 20s will make a potlock surely there will be leftovers I always keep some plastic container basic one you can buy at the dollar store that I actually got from margerine containers that I cleaned because its the exact same model It sits in my cupboard waiting to get used I brought 5 of them at the party why you ask? Because you never know The potlock was sorta fun but inebriated cooking and inebriated planning before the cooking leads to questionable results Leftovers happenned more than they thought I hate wasting food and the friend who organized the party what a great guy also stated to avoid wasting food as much as possible but alas it happenned No one had containers for leftovers except for good old me who gave my cheap container to save the day and the food I also brought spare reusable shopping bags at the party I was part of the cleaning team lots of stuff was left by the others lots of stuff was brought at my place thanks to those bags I mean there was a whole barely openned can of maple syrup that stuff is expensive I just wrapped it up in saran wrap and put a rubberband (that I had in my bag you guessed it) and it was sealed I put a beer bottle box at the bottom of my bag so it could sit up right --- Covid happenned were all sent home fear settles in and theres no food at the grocery because people bought everything for the confinement? Guess who had loads of canned food way before march 2020 The neighbor? The old cat lady down the street? Elvis Presley on his island? No me Why having loads of canned food in your cupboard? ***bEaCaUsE yOu NeVeR kNoW*** --- Im always ready for every eventuality friends learned it with time I like making fun of myself for this I think its ridiculous sometimes but if Im not prepped I always have bad feelings Overthinking made me win more than it made me lose thats a fact,IYIine,16204859260,3

gxf1wn0,n79n8y,It all began in the winter of 2018 My mother is aging and Im always looking for ways to make life a little more comfortable and convenient for her I decided to buy her a bidet toilet seat She took a bad fall and broke her arm a few year prior and it was becoming more difficult to wipe after going to the bathroom I head to Costco (large American warehouse store) buy the bidet and head home to install it as a surprise Unfortunately the bidet needs to be plugged in (it has a nightlight heated seat water heater drying fan and a remote control) and there was no electrical outlet within reach of the power cord Instead of returning the fancy $300+ bidet and replacing it with a regular one that doesnt require power I decided to add an electrical outlet at a convenient location on the wall behind her toilet Well when you give a mouse a cookie the only way to install an outlet at that location is to go through the wall to my bathroom on the other side of the wall This required me to remove my bathroom mirror since I had to run wiring through the wall to my light switch When I removed the mirror the little metal strip that holds the mirror in place on the top of the backsplash got damaged The backsplash was the same material as the countertop (ugly yellowish color which was apparently all the rage back in the 1970s when the house was built) So then I decided I may as well replace the backsplash AND countertop This turned into an entire bathroom remodel I buy all the stuff I need replacing the sink faucet water pipes countertop backsplash and drywall While Im at Home Depot I decide to buy additional electrical components to add an outlet to my bathroom as well Since I already had the wall open why not? I add the electrical components install the new sink and countertops and repair the drywall Thank goodness you can find out how to do all these projects on YouTube This entire project took me about a year to complete So now its February of 2020 and my bathroom is looking pretty good but I still needed to replace my toilet because it looked old and everything else was new I head to Costco and buy a replacement toilet Next to the toilets are the very same bidets and now theyre on sale I decide to treat myself and buy another one for my bathroom After all I had a power source At the time I had a full time job (and a life) so I didnt get around to installing the bidet in my bathroom until the second week of March No less than a week later its announced that we are going into Covid lockdown and theres a run on toilet paper I was due to buy my normal allotment and I couldnt find any anywhere What were these savages thinking? Why toilet paper of all things? Since I couldnt find toilet paper I decided to buy a tremendous amount of alcohol I figured that if the world as I knew it was coming to an end I could barter alcohol for various goods (like toilet paper) Turns out I drank most of the booze over the last year I digress Anyhow it all worked out for my household The bidets are awesome My bootyhole has never felt cleaner I dont even use toilet paper unless Im in too much of a hurry to let the drying fan on the bidet work its magic I had never used a bidet before because Im an American and well Murca! We drive big cars shoot big guns and if we choose to smear poop all over ourselves when we wipe its our God given right! I am a convert though and I highly recommend getting a bidet This is my first post so I hope you enjoyed,PubliousDeLaNoche,16205017580,3

gxcrgtr,n79n8y,I dont know if this counts but my last job was terrible and I had the scenario play out in my head for a year that management would try to screw me One day the feeling became so intense that I went to our union about the situation The harassment false promises blatant sexism (female in tech) threats sabotage union busting etc As Im telling the union rep my concerns management sends them an email stating that they (management) wants them (union) to fire me The rep is just astounded and states "Were the union we dont fire people Who are these people?!" Well all that overthinking meant I had oodles of evidence Even though they disabled my work email the emails were still on my devices and I screenshot them and the chats as well Boy oh boy they werent happy about that Then they tried to falsify my dismissal to unemployment The unemployment rep was a turd willing to ignore everything I said and I threw it in her face "I have evidence that they are lying Do you?" The union stepped in with assistance from my doctor and neurologist to show how management had been lying This is on top of the 6 *MONTHS* it took to get a correct record of employment They actually sent me three incorrect records before unemployment just took my word for the hours and pay for the last year Ive never heard of that happening But all that overthinking had me ready for their bullshit Funny bit of irony bonus: They refused to let me work from home as punishment for standing up for myself 6 months later Covid hit and they arent allowed to work from the office,Vee-Shan,16204468120,2

The extra food cuts into our budget more (but not by much) and we would need to eat at home a bit extra if the COVID thing turns out not to be a big deal in the states Whats the upside?

gxchfdq,n79n8y,The COVID-19 pandemic Id been closely monitoring reports on reddit re: Dr Li Wenliang alerting the public to a strange new infectious respiratory disease that he was seeing more of in patients; I think Id initially heard about it was at the very end of 2019 or in the first few days of 2020 (it was shortly before or shortly after NYE) My mind went into overdrive about what the possible fallout of this could be and decided the wisest course of action would be to prep like we were headed toward the next Great Depression Wed just closed on our first home in late 2019 and finally had a stable space of our own I continued to monitor the situation and as incidents of the virus to increase we took action by purchasing a chest freezer; I did a shit ton of research about gardening in harsh environments and conducted numerous cycles of soil testing and we overhauled our yard into an abundant kitchen garden with loads of different vegetables fruits and herbs and flowers We stocked up on dried goods and cupboard staples restocked our storage water and all emergency kits; we basically we went into hardcore prepper mode for what appeared to be a disaster We made sure our solar panel system was fully functional (to offset the increased consumption costs wed likely incur by being home all the time) Instead of hoarding paper goods like toilet paper we bought a bidet attachment and purchased a modest amount of toilet paper so as not to put any additional strain on supply chains By the time the first mid-March lockdown rolled around in 2020 wed already hunkered down and had avoided most public places for several weeks (save for a trip to the nursery and dispensary fully masked in n95s in late Feb 2020) Even with all of that preparation the pandemic has been a punch to the gut but we were exceedingly lucky My hyper-vigilance has caused me a tremendous amount of anxiety during periods of my life but in this instance it literally kept us safe and protected us from being exposed to COVID and saved us from unnecessarily contracting the virus and passing it on to others unknowingly Though finances have been tricky and challenging to navigate were still alive and covid-free Overthinking a plate of beans FTW,ek-photo,16204407520,1

gxchqkb,n79n8y,Probably the whole situation with Covid to be honest I remember on New Years Eve 2019 reading about this mystery virus within a week I was carrying hand sanitiser everywhere and using it following going to the shops or public transport because I was starting to get concerned I couldnt see it being successfully contained When I told people I was feeling worried about it I was mostly either laughed at or told it was nothing to worry about I even asked my doctor about it after an appointment some time in February and was told it wasnt anything to be concerned about only the very frail were getting any complications By the time it had started spreading and people were beginning to realise this might actually be something to worry about Id been "over thinking" it for weeks and making little preparations (I made sure I had a good amount of all of my medication had a few emergency meals in the freezer incase the shops were really difficult to get into at any point - that paid off quite well) Just little preparations not that it really eased my anxiety much Once it was announced we were going into lock down suddenly my household didnt find my concern so funny anymore Mentally Id been prepared for that happening for a while at that point which Im actually quite grateful for because I think it really helped prevent my mental health taking such a dip during that time For me since Id been so concerned and following it so closely for a couple of months at that point it almost felt like a relief to see it get taken seriously and to slow down the spread of it,AnxiousSquirrel345,16204409220,1

gxcuh97,n79n8y,Ive had dogs with me for the vast majority of my life and its never come up but ever since I was young and heard that bones could fall apart and choke I always wanted to know how to get stuff out of their throat Its never really come up though one dog put in a valiant attempt when we came home and he had a cassette tape dragging behind him and the tape part in his gullet I had just helped clean that damn room and know for a fact the only thing at his level was some books on a bookshelf office furniture etc It must have been like really high up and fell off somehow Anyways We recently got a new puppy We did our best for four months to try and adopt from a shelter but this was near the beginning of the pandemic and (fortunately for the animals) the shelters in a huge area around us were all empty continuously Which is great for the animals Id rather every single one be adopted than even one sitting in a cage wondering why theyre there So eventually we found a guy who had just bred a litter of puppies And no this wasnt a puppy mill We made damn sure to do our research And it had been a few years since the other litter so she wasnt being constantly farmed for puppies to sell We strongly believed that our previous dog had extended the length and quality of our older dog by providing companionship and exercise They played for hours a day and the extra exercise and companionship had to do him some good He wouldve kept going strong at 12 years old if during a checkup they hadnt missed a super early sign of cancer I dont fault the vet When reading about it to help cope the symptom he had was innocuous and easily missed Before all that he had nearly perfect health exams When we got our puppy she was very interested in chewing on sticks Many times I had to follow her asking her what she had in her mouth and shed trot away trying to hide that she had a stick Chewing sticks was a no-no because they can fragment and choke the dog She liked her fake toy stick and her teething rings quick a bit but sticks just had some allure to them One day about two months ago I got up in the early afternoon (I lost my job because of COVID Im not a NEET Im taking online courses for a possible career in the trades) As I was greeting the dogs I noticed that the younger one had a piece of stick in her mouth and it was in a really weird position It was stuck between two teeth near the back of her mouth and it was lodged so it ran the width of her mouth Hope this gives a better description: T = tooth T--roof of mouth--T Then I asked that damned question "What have you got in your mouth?" and that when the fucker dislodged itself and then re-lodged itself in her throat I had thought about this scenario ever since I was pretty young and it just now happened She coughed and hacked a couple times and it scared my mother and the other dog I immediately got a hold of her gently rolled her onto her back (cant do that too fast or it can cause the object to slip further down their throat) holding her head flat and her mouth open I began doing the sweep of the throat with my finger The one where you make your finger into a little hook Surprisingly being a scared puppy she did not fight me and I was able to feel the stick and then get my middle finger down there and slide the stick out carefully Didnt want to hurt her throat or cause any pain that might make her jump and me lose hold of the stick It was only a couple seconds but it felt a bit longer you know the feeling when theres a sudden problem and you just start thinking a lot faster? Basically that Id always been afraid Id be grossed out by having to look and feel around inside her throat but very thankfully I didnt even think about it After a couple seconds she crawled onto my lap and our older dog came over to check on her he was sniffing and rubbing her muzzle with his own and I just petted her for a little bit And then five minutes later she either forgot what had happened or didnt care because they both raced to the back yard to play frisbee After that I was very thorough in de-stickifying the back yard We have the second largest oak tree in the county in our front yard and its canopy is huuuuuuuge so that sucker is always dropping sticks The dog wood in the back isnt nearly so bad Please excuse any major errors in formatting or spelling I wrote this on my phone,Terranrp2,16204488290,1
gxcv0t5,n79n8y,This isnt that crazy but our friends family and acquaintances certainly thought it was at the time: My husband and I had been following the Covid outbreak long before it was called a pandemic by the WHO Honestly when we watched the first lockdown in Wuhan on the news my stomach sank We were both like this is a huge city not normal internal alarm bells going off and soon its going to be here (we live in the eastern US) We have several friends in Europe which helped a bit They were laughing as they told us that people were going crazy over toilet paper After a bit of an internet rabbit hole of research and anecdotal accounts we discovered that in many a crisis toilet paper and gasoline were the first commodities in hot demand and also the first to run out Now we are NOT normally hoarders or doomsday preppers or crazy (yea that terms loaded and relative but we both generally laugh at the US media that like to blow things out of proportion for ratings) but this time we were spooked We hoarded We bought like 80 rolls of tp rice pasta canned food filled up the gas tanks in our cars got lysol wipes extra soap etc All this happened before the month of March when things got bad in Lombardi Italy and then New York City There were no lines no masks no concerns and people looked at us like we were lunatics People made fun of us on Facebook Some even unfriended us lol good riddance in the long run Welllll it all came crashing down a few weeks later and we were able to help some nice neighbors with supplies As far as the shitty asses that called us morons and later whined about not finding supplies  sucks to have been you That little bit of satisfaction was the smallest consolation prize though imo With over half a million dead in our country there are no winners in this situation,Thingkumploosh,16204492140,1

gxcyblz,n79n8y,Covids effect on stores here in Australia I was a girl scout so "be prepared" is a life motto and Ive had a few really bad times in my life where just getting food has been hard so I now ensure I always have plenty of shelf stable food on hand just in case Im also from SoCal where fire/earthquake/flooding are not unknown so I like to have emergency supplies I moved to Australia about a year before covid and began slowly building up my new food storage and emergency supplies (had to donate all my other stuff) During that time we had a situation where the roads were closed out of Western Australia and there were shortages of some types of foods - fire on one road cyclone flooding the other yes there are only really 2 main roads out its a remote state with a lot of wilderness like hot Alaska Since I dont drive here yet (opposite side of the road hurts my brain) I became familiar with e-commerce and online shopping here in Australia and began to realize that a lot of stuff was dependent on imports and that a lot of websites were not that great so I began stepping up my "prepping" just in case - that experience with the roads showed me that we have somewhat fragile supply lines in Perth - and rebuilt my emergency kit a bit more quickly When I saw the news in China while the fires were going on I bought a bit more than usual during my grocery pickup The staff even teased me a ton about preparing for the end of the world (most people here seem to shop on a as-needed basis so this was me getting like 2 bags of rice and a dozen cans of stuff) Well when covid hit there was a massive run on the stores - every store even the online ones Panic buying was unknown here which made it even more of a frenzy The grocery stores TURNED OFF their online ordering because their systems couldnt handle the demand while other stores had websites that took forever to load and lost orders because they were overloaded so the only way to get food (and many other supplies) was to go in personand even that didnt mean places would be in stock Stuff like canned cat food masks antibacterial wipes bleach batteries exercise equipment just a huge range of everything were just out of stock for weeks or longer Because of our supplies (and the garden I started a few months beforehand) we were able to almost completely avoid stores for nearly 3 months until online ordering came back online and stocks replenished which we were very grateful for as Im immunocompromised I also conviced my husband to upgrade our ute to a nice affordable little used 4x4 since the Ute was getting old and unreliable and we wanted to road trip Once lockdown lifted people in WA were basically stuck here so everyone bought 4x4s and caravans and the prices went up a TON so were grateful for me making that call!,whatisevenrealnow,16204517250,1

h27pkuc,o2hlbv,Well its not as good as going back to age 11 or 12 but it will have to do A lot would hinge on being able to convince my parents that this traveling-back jas occurred In 1999 theres the clinton impeachment trial the columbine massacre and family guy airing for the first time after the super bowl so i would predict those i guess and use them as leverage to try to convince them The big priorities then would be going over some stuff adult me knew then but much more deeply understands the impact and trauma of _now_: At the time (ive since been diagnosed but not until my 30s) i had adhd combined type and was literally powering through my schoolwork entirely on my ability to ignore my own emotional trauma and cram for stuff in the hour before tests extremely fast because i typically forgot my assignments in between; i would put forward that i need formal assessment as well as appropriate medication to have the resources I need to excel I am probably also autistic (adhd and autism are often comorbid) and in either case have some sensory issues particularly sound-related that need to be addressed for me to be able to thrive I would also have recommendations for other family members My older brother B also had undiagnosed adhd and depression S too to an extent (pretty much all of us had some degree of depression really) Dad also has really bad adhd which between that and his own unprocessed insecurity and anger issues explains a lot Mom has depression In general all of us are traumatized and neuroatypical in various ways and different things turn out to work for all of us Also quitting smoking for brother b and sister r happen but take time Also i start nicotine lozenges as a low dose nootropic for adhd along w my adhd meds in this timeline because it is helping me a lot now I am transgender It would be too late for some effects of puberty and hormones but much better than where I am now This would be a much harder conversation and would need to take several reminders to hit home to get them to see me as their daughter and not as someone that had just had some kind of episode and was laying all those stuff on them I would have to put a lot of effort just to convince them that it wasnt a fetish or a mental disorder and in fact makes sense given our general family history as well as the history of the world and the nature of biology Oh also my uncle sam has autism and is kind of low functioning as well as problems with hoarding And is like me a closeted trans woman Also my sister Rs second child V (if borm the same in this timeline which maybe not) is going to have special needs related to autism because they are of the nonspeaking category and need to get enrolled in an assistive program And is probably ALSO trans although that is not definite And T who was already born / Vs older brother? Depression So these are all issues we are better off confronting and treating rather than avoiding starting with: i need to get on hormone blockers and adhd meds B needs adhd meds antidepressants and therapy Dad needs adhd meds and therapy These three people are key because we affect quality of life the most for the family but every one of us has things that they need But everyone needs some degree of intervention ultimately Everyone in the family pretty much needs therapy eventually for different reasons Mom and dad seriously need a better way to deal with dads severe adhd and inability to get housechores done or succeed in life generally without guilt tripping or verbally abusing him anymore Dad needs to acknowledge that things being unhygienic and disorganized is hard for him and everyone else I would also have to convince them that B is actually violently abusive and threatens my safety and that the antidepressants helped him a lot in being less violent last time around Also that he should not hang out with cousin M who nearly blinds him with a bb gun in his right eye in a backyard accident and has bad impulse control issues and empathy deficits and is a general bad influence Hard conversations to have all around Oh also some general strategies Uncle ss house is falling apart and is possibly unfixable and they will dwindle their inheritance away on nonsense and fill the house entirely after grandpas death due to depression anxiety and aforementioned hoarding (sorry lots to keep track of my upbringing was chaotic) The best thing is while grandpa B is alive to get him looked at for brain stuff since an aneurysm is what kills him And to figure out a better plan for sams house than what happened last time Preferably to move stuff to storage fix up and sell the place before the foundations and the chimney get worse Get on top of the hoarding issues before the rats take over entirely And then buy s and grandpa b another house Cousin M may be falling in with gangs and getting addicted to meth around then Aunt M may need therapy but probably wont get it They are kinda all toxic af the cousins really The good news is all the kids are super smart and capable I would go back knowing brother S did well in tech support brother B did well in construction but his real talent probably lies in computer engineering auto mechanics or biology - but first adhd depression and i am gonna guess with the violence and the rages he might like me be in that maybe-autistic range too And that i was successful but deeply unhappy in software engineering And that i should focus on doing what i am passionate about while there is time to launch something and not listen to moms pessimistic naysaying about it being impossible to succeed if you do what you love I would also of course have us win a lottery if I could prepare before going back at all I would give them my limited financial advice which is to put a lot of the money into cash deposits but also some into specific investments like google and amazon And later bitcoin Since i already have part of a computer engineering degree and six years of software industry experience i would also have all that knowledge so that would be a serious leg up on the education game I guess i would focus on actually completing my computer engineering degree this time I would focus on the running start program again in high school but be set up with adhd meds and know which people to befriend and who to avoid this time (some of them turned out to be awful but mostly i would be seeking out my old friends One sexually assaults someone if i recall for instance I would have a talk with the victim in private in advance and try to prevent this as best i could) I would tell J about how miserable ish life in japan turns out but also the good stuff (his daughter Miyumi mainly) I would have another recommendation for my family: hire housekeepers now that we are rich Too many people who cant quite look after themselves reliably Same for (aunt) s wherever they end up I would start on hrt as soon as i could By the time i got into uni i would be a lot more comfortable mentally and healthier physically I would focus on completing my computer engineering degree I would be able to afford to get it this time I would not live in campus housing but i would move to dt portland i would help out natali with the homelessness situation again and give her the same advice albeit with some caveats (this guy you meet who houses you and puts you through school has anger issues and will turn a bit abusive You decide you love him anyways in my timeline and he gets into therapy and stuff improves a bit for you both But nerds in general in hindsight are no less prone to toxicity) I would also seek out my uni friend cam since we would not be in the same year anymore I would admit that what i was going to say would sound a bit nuts but that i had to thank her for inspiring me with her courage in being able to come out and be myself the last time around I would also warn her about covid and the coastal fires and upcoming political disasters re trump and give some stock tips as part of that thank you I think with enough lotto winnings i could focus on art and fixing the planet I guess i would get into drones and cybersecurity for uh reasons And maybe be some kind of tech media figure who was kinda solarpunk / transhumanist / socialist themed Probably try to start like freegeek but for vehicles with a focus on lithium ion battery recycling to keel them out of the waste stream And take muay thai again And get into rollerblades and date more Generally the changes would be amazing although i would sometimes get a little sad about people i never met this time but i would also be happy about people i did meet i hadnt run inti last time I couldnt solve every world problem nor would i want to,keirapersephoneblack,16240268290,1

gvd5dp5,mvicaw,I work in dermatology and although not intuitive there are many skin manifestations of COVID 19 Some manifestations are relatively specific others not so much I had a patient in our outpatient clinic who presented with pernio (one of the more specific skin manifestations of COVID) who flat-out refused to wear a mask to her appointment refused to allow us to administer a COVID swab and proceeded to counsel me on how COVID was hoax Given that we had a high suspicion of COVID we shut down out clinic for the day for the safety of our other patients One of my nurses tested positive 3 days later (despite self-isolating) and we had to keep the clinic closed until all other workers had a negative results (this took 10 days) Although this was costly to my practice what bothered me the most was the inconvenience that it placed on all the other patient I was supposed to see that week In fact one of the patients who had to move their appointment was subsequently diagnosed with melanoma (likely didnt change their disease course but was still difficult to see) Edit: The nurse is healthy she had a mild course Also it has been shown that patients with pernio often have a less severe course with COVID which Im sure only exacerbated this entire situation Havent seen the patient again Edit 2: first gold thanks!

gvdlmnc,mvicaw,ICU nurse here (6 years) Dealt with COVID since March 2020 (actually had the first confirmed pt at our hospital) November-February was rough I had a two week streak where every day one or two of my patients would die Wed go up to 3 oor 4 patient assignments (the norm is 2:1 or 1:1 if on certain equipment) Most all of the patients understood the severity of what they had A handful didnt believe they had COVID even though removing hi flow O2 or their BIPAP would put their sats down into the 60s or 70s Many had comorbidities that put them at risk (COPD/asthma obesity/sleep apnea smoking) I think people would refuse to be intubated because they knew what the outcome would be Fight hope pray fingers crossed whatever you want to call it delaying the inevitable Our ICU attending would actually have them sign consent for intubation (if they were cognizant enough to do so) Almost all of them died Very few made it out alive but still so sick and debilitated (some with trachs) One guy in particular sticks out This was right after Christmas 21 years old hx DM1 obesity sleep apnea didnt like to take his insulin Admitted with COVID Didnt believe he had it Should have been tubed days before but refused then he ended up being intubated emergently Took about 5 of us to prone him (lay him on his stomach) because his O2 sats were in the 60s Couldnt get a pulse (noticed no waveform on the art line) Had to flip him back over to do CPR for about an hour or so before we called it Had a kid and a fiancee Honestly it was more of the families that denied their loved one had COVID Upset (understandably) about not being able to visit Zoom calls just dont cut it I say this all as my parents (mom/SD and dad/SM) are all covid deniers even when I tell them what its like "Well those people had other things wrong with them though they were older" they tell me They send me links about all the conspiracy theories re:covid I got the Moderna in December and January still havent told them Its awful The facial swelling alone from being prone is enough to give a person nightmares Watching someone go into multi system organ failure needing dialysis unable to put them back onto their back being maxed out on ventilator settings and that still not being enough to the point of barotrauma and collapsing a lung and needing a chest tube to reinflate it Families saying "do everything" even though they had coded once or twice Hearing families on Zoom crying praying singing as the patient is intubated sedated and paralyzed so the ventilator can do the work Tearing up under all the PPE because yeah we are still human We work so hard and sometimes it doesnt fucking matter But we go back day after day I wish people who dont believe could see what I have seen It might scare them enough to take precautions seriously and get the vaccine,dalek_max,16190435750,5689

gvfngcc,mvicaw,Not a doctor or nurse but my coworker and her family all caught covid but were denier They believed it was all a hoax and that even in the unlikely event that there was something going around it was just being played up and blown out for corporate gains/the libs and pharmacy companies were just trying to get money and control but god would protect them in the end so they still attended church and when the church had to shut down due to state mandates they all went to their preachers house and worshiped there Both her parents her 6 siblings that lived with them her other 8 siblings that had visited for Thanksgiving their spouses 5 of her nieces and nephews and herself all got covid because someone who was positive attended a church service with them and most of the congregation caught covid as well Her family didnt believe it was a thing and when 2 of the nephews werent feeling well no one thought anything of it She went to work kept having to be reminded to keep her mask on even when the store was closed she spent the majority of the day with myself and the store manager on a project in very close quarters then her mom and a few siblings had to be rushed from work to the ER due to them not being able to breathe We all found out a few days later that she and everyone I had listed from her family had gotten tested and tested positive and she had come to work anyway because she felt fine and believed that it was all a hoax When she eventually came back to work about a month later she was still suffering from long term effects and explained that at first they had all fought being quarantined and thought they werent allowed to visit the hospitalized family members due to the hospital putting on a show to keep up the covid lie Then her dad and in total 14 other family members had to be put in the ICU and have tubes put in because they were so bad The ones who werent in the hospital either had no symptoms at all to mild symptoms; she ended up having mild symptoms Her dad apparently kept fighting and screaming that he didnt have covid and it was just some mutated flu so the hospitals could get money the government could instate martial law and that he was a child of god who was protected then he ended up going brain dead due to lack of oxygen and eventually the family decided to pull him off of life support But when it was all said and done my coworker lost 8 family members was asked to resign for knowingly coming to work with covid and not telling anyone and has had difficulty finding work because the health effects afterwards have her needing to sit down every 20 or so steps As for my boss and I my boss tested positive the same day as her daughter who got it from work so it went through their family and she lost her brother who was housing her daughter and granddaughter right before the positive test and I and my husband ended up testing negative but ironically/extremely luckily ended up with just a regular flu a few days after I was exposed,2baverage,16190927470,35

gvds9le,mvicaw,Sort of related but I felt the need to chime in Im a new ICU nurse that started working roughly 8 months ago We had a young patient (<35 years old) that wasnt admitted for COVID but we were all pretty certain that they had it previously and their lungs were significantly damaged resulting in their admission This patient was on high flow nasal cannula for a while but progressed to 100% BiPaP (a mask you wear which forces air into your lungs basically the closest thing you can get to a ventilator without having a breathing tube) This patient would routinely desaturate to less then 30% with their mask off I am not exaggerating here Normal pulse ox sats are 92-100% Incredibly sick patients in respiratory distress coming into the ED can be in the 50-60% range Again LESS than 30% perfect waveform and everything Unbelievable Regardless the conversation of intubation (breathing tube) was brought up multiple times to the patient and family The family refused every time claiming that putting the patient on the ventilator was just the hospital trying to make money off of them During one of the final conversations with the family it got so heated that our hospital security had to come and escort the family out after the team pleaded for them to try the ventilator as it was basically the only chance they had in saving the patient Family didnt budge A day later the patient coded (heart stopped) and the patient had to be emergently intubated They were able to bring him back but less then 24 hours later they coded again and passed away I didnt directly work with this patient but it was incredibly frustrating to hear about Us nurses often joke about the "big nursing bucks" that we make Granted I feel fairly compensated most of the time but no one in their right mind in the hospital is in it solely for the financial incentive I have met some absolutely brilliant people working in the ICU who likely could have made 10x their salary working in another field People dedicate their lives working to hopefully be able to save someone elses The idea that healthcare workers are out here to make money related to the horrific situations of others is absolutely ludicrous,tozli,16190467900,30

gved8wz,mvicaw,Shit wished I would have seen this earlier I have posted most of this all before for the past year really So I am in hospital administration for a very large health system I dont do anything even remotely heroic like the doctors and nurses but being where I am at gives me a huge overview of many cases I have seen and heard a lot this past year I am in a very conservative state and most people around me lean heavily to the right OK So The beginning was interesting because so many were saying that it wont affect our state It was just a flu It was man made But then we started making changes in policies Temp checks mandatory masks construction We got shit done Then we get slammed It was bad but it could have been worse The worst thing with the patients and families were the visitor restrictions None allowed People would not believe they had it Or the family wouldnt believe it People died and the family would not believe it Even a case where it seemed less important that grandpa died They just didnt want it covid related on the death certificate People demanded to see the bodies but couldnt Trying to sue the people risking their lives to save their mask hating asses During a trip I made to one of our drive through testing centers they told a story of a woman that had a high fever knew she had covid and 6 members of her family came along for the ride so they could see her get tested Stupid I could literally make this as long as I want But I will say this For my part I didnt handle it well Almost had a nervous breakdown No idea how the Drs and nurses stay sane But I avoided getting it Till December If I would have made it just 17 more days I would have gotten my first shot But nope Wife got it I got it from her It was bad I think we both almost ended up in our own ER But we fought it at home And she still has issues For me I had the long lasting brain fog It was depressing because I was just not myself sometimes Even had hallucinations But then after waiting the required 90 days I got my first Pfizer shot and after I recovered from the shot itself my brain issues were gone I am about 100% better now And that is the footnotes version of my story,Penguin_shit15,16190573400,15
gverue6,mvicaw,He (30some yoM) came in with his girlfriend early in the pandemic and both clearly had it They both were requiring oxygen her to a lesser extent He was satting in the 70s-80s on room air but thought it was bullshit We saw often with covid that the initial clinical picture didnt match their oxygen sats For example an asthmatic with sats the 70s would be diaphoretic pale and in clear distress But covid patients could tolerate terrible sats and felt and clinically "looked" better than their crappy numbers showed They would eventually tire out all the sudden and crump He was feeling halfway decent and didnt believe the seriousness of it He left AMA after a lengthy discussion involving the phrase "you will die" His girlfriend was admitted A few days later a John Doe came in in cardiac arrest and died A doctor recognized him from before and literally brought the girlfriend down to ID him in the ER because identification was needed (he had no wallet on him was found down in a random spot) I had this woman as a patient in the ER a month later and she was an absolute mess She was still feeling physically horrible but her primary issue was clearly severe PTSD/anxiety related to the whole event She was convinced she still had covid and was going to die She had been to the ER dozens of times at that point It was a really tragic story all around,tiger749,16190658130,15

gveoohi,mvicaw,Covid nurse for most of 2020 Had some that came to the ED for shortness of breath cough etc and tested positive They admitted them and then they would sign themselves out AMA (against medical advice) either before coming to the floor or right after arriving because it was a fake virus the hospital just wanted to make more money by testing everyone etc At the very beginning they actually called the hospitals legal department to see if the patient was allowed to sign out AMA since this was a public health crisis Normally patients that are oriented can sign themselves out even if they are actively having a heart attack etc However the concern was letting someone leave who knowingly has a communicable disease who is not going to isolate wear a mask etc and expose the public to it They said it would be illegal to hold him and we had to let them go With all the mistakes that were made (and many of them made multiple times such as re-opening things and relaxing mask use) I have full confidence that with the next pandemic the officials and a percentage of the public will do everything wrong again Edit: I will add that far more patients had what I termed "Covid regret" That is they admitted they didnt believe the news the doctors etc and were careless and now regretted it One caught it at a party their family had Their elderly sister exposed them all and recovered; my patient died three days later It was a sad realization for many who lived or died and a most unfortunate way to learn,toejamandtoast,16190637930,14

Started yelling (which led to violent coughing and even more shortness of breath) that COVID was "a hoax created by CNN to put Obama back on the throne" and left AMA when he regained his breath My wife reported him to the health dept because he was spewing virus everywhere 2 nights later (on her shift) was brought by ambulance unresponsive and sats in the toilet She tubed him and admitted him to a COVID unit where he died the next day She had a patient in the unit (woman mid-50s) that would beg/plead with everyone to be moved to a different unit She was convinced that COVID was a hoax and that anyone that was sent to a COVID-designated area had been marked to be killed to "reinforce the numbers" and "perpetuate the lie" She likened the COVID units to the gas chambers in the Holocaust and started referring to the hospital as "the showers" and calling all the staff Nazis She even started speaking "German" to the nurses (in reality English with a bad german accent) so theyd let her live She didnt meet protocols but everyone desperately wanted to tu e her During my wifes off-week she was downgraded to the floor and then transferred to a hospital closer to family She never learned her final dispo but assumes she was released back into the public to keep spreading "the truth",Cake_or_Pi,16190519320,11

How could we discharge him from the hospital so soon etc etc she was going to sue the hospital Apparently he had lied to his wife that WE were the ones who sent him home; I had to calmly tell her he left against medical advice We tried to convince him to stay and we even made him sign a form before he left that he was leaving against medical advice And that there are witnesses from nurses nursing directors technicians and doctors who could all attest to that effect Beyond selfish and self absorbed Inconveniencing so many people- including his own wife,TheSunscreenLife,16190574560,12

Its all a hoax! The whole thing is a hoax! Fuck every one of you!*" He then started spitting at everybody he walked by He was in the lobby at this point and hes going up to patients spitting at them He spit at me (even though I was behind glass) Security detained him and police were called What was most infuriating was he was just allowed to leave Its like nobody wanted to get close to bother with him Even the doctor just waved him off to the police like "Just get him out of here" One woman whom he spat on was yelling at the cops that she wanted to press charges and they just dismissed her and let the lunatic go I too was fuming that after watching him assault (spit at) all these people he was able to just get in his car and drive off Namely because you knew he presented a danger This guy wasnt going home to isolate Hell be spreading it all over But the cops and medical staff just seemed exhausted and relieved he was out of the building and somebody elses problem It was very disappointing I asked a nurse standing by me why they werent pressing charges and she just sighed like "Whats the point?"

gve27pk,mvicaw,Recently diagnosed a patient with COVID-19 I tell the patient "you have covid" start talking about treatment options to which the patient replies: "I dont want anything to do with Covid" I ask what they mean Patient says "I got talked into a covid shot by my mom and have felt sick ever since I dont want anything else for covid" I explained that they were feeling sick because they had the covid virus and not because of the vaccine - that they probably got infected 1-2 weeks before they got the shot and patient was very dismissive saying they werent here for that They were here because they felt sick after the vaccine It eventually got through to them but was a very odd experience,greenwood-villian,16190517280,5
gve3i3r,mvicaw,Not a doctor Im actually a research coordinator for COVID vaccines And this is actually the opposite situation So as you probably know the vaccines are tested in clinical trials before they are released So once the vaccine is approved or at least emergency approved we bring all the patients back in for the study and get them vaccinated (the process is different from study to study) So when Moderna was released we brought all the Moderna patients back in we unblind them and everyone who got placebo can now have their vaccine So each patient I see I ask them (cuz Im curious) if they think they got the vaccine As you can probably guess most people are right Around 80% can guess if they did or didnt have it The 20% that are wrong are the people who successfully got a vaccine but didnt have any symptoms yes uncommon but it does happen (Id ballpark it at 33% of my patients that were vaccinated didnt get any symptoms) Well one day I had a lady who was a known hypochondriac She was 100% sure she got vaccine Muscle soreness the next day on both injections fever night sweats nausea you name it she had all the symptoms reported TWICE (for both injections) no joke this lady got a placebo it absolutely blew her mind Needless to say she is the butt of every joke at work now,Nickjames116425,16190523770,5

gvdon71,mvicaw,I am a physician and regularly care for patients with diseases far worse than covid so maybe my perspective is warped If anyone would like a different perspective here it is Just like in others areas of life there are varying attitudes amongst physicians and I have many peers who agree with me The data in the effectiveness of cloth masks preventing the transmission of a partially airborne highly infectious respiratory virus in the community is weak at best And even if they did work It is curious why some are so desperate to believe they dont work both ways (they only prevent the virus from getting out not getting in which from a biophysics standpoint is highly dubious) so asymptomatic bystanders must be mandated by law to conform to the neuroses of those afraid of a virus with a survival rate well over 99% for all comers that mainly kills the morbidly obese and those near the end of their life who would die from a variety of infectious causes should they contract them We should be able to discuss what the value of liberty is in this society and make individual risk assessments about what is appropriate If you are scared you might die from coronavirus the solution is not to make everyone on an airplane wear a marginally effective (at best) symbol that you can see to calm your nerves the solution is to not get on an airplane because that is something you are personally uncomfortable with Its an incredibly selfish and dishonest way of thinking The retort is that X amount have died dont you care about people dying? The uncomfortable truth is that people die from all sorts of things that is the nature of life and when we leave our house and engage in normal life there will always be risks If this virus had a 25% death rate wed be having a different conversation But it doesnt No one wants to think about this rationally and lets be honest there are plenty who love the masks because they are a visual symbol to identify what you believe and they love the fact that they can force other people to wear them in public because they know they hate it This kind of thinking all goes together Only the government can determine how you should act what you should wear where you can go and how you should be able to protect yourself and your family etc It is disingenuous to boil this down to "if you question the efficacy of masks or the constitutionality of mandates regardless of efficacy then you must be a rather stupid person and we should shame and make fun of you" It is much deeper than that and what arguments like that really are are ad hominems that try to shut down debates and bully everyone into agreement There are plenty of my physician colleagues who agree with me and up until last year when masks became politicized because of mandates based on weak/no data it was well understood in the scientific community that only fit tested n95 masks conveyed any meaningful level of protection and that surgical masks offered little benefit outside of a healthcare environment and certainly not homemade cloth masks What changed? Politics Was there a study that suddenly showed people can safely engage in normal activities with masks on? No but there was a randomized trial from Denmark the Danmask study that at the very least cast doubt on the efficacy of mask mandates but it is verboten to discuss it yet we routinely cite far weaker studies on a daily basis The fact that Dr Fauci is wearing his cute masks with cartoons on it after receiving the vaccine speaks volumes Yes you can still get the virus after receiving the vaccine but the vaccine reduces the odds by orders of magnitudes and significantly lessens its severity of you contract it So your already extremely low odds of death from the virus are now even more extremely remote There is no level other than zero that will satisfy Dr Fauci and the fear mongers because they know there is a decent chance this pandemic will be endemic and the virus will not go away Does that justify permanent suspension of liberty for the rest of our lives with the government telling you where you can go and what you have to do and wear on public? We lived with smallpox a far more deadly virus for a very long time and it was one of the few infectious diseases we were able to eradicate completely with vaccines Yet we did not shut our societies down and isolate everyone during the process People died from smallpox Lots of them That is the nature of life The whole thing is pathetic And its especially sad when highly educated doctors tell people they need a vaccine after recently recovering from covid (they dont) and that we need to keep wearing masks despite having immunity (we dont) Its obvious there is something else going on If you want to wear a mask in the community nobody is stopping you By voluntarily wearing a mask you are basically saying that you disagree that this virus has any significant aersolized component (it does) as the aerosol cannot be contained by non n95 masks So if its droplet only then just stay a few feet away from people without masks on if you are going to be around them for more than a few minutes Problem solved Or just get the vaccine and live your life normally without ever worrying about masks or distancing again Once you get the vaccine the pandemic is essentially over for you Period So stop,RangeOrnery,16190450240,-20

guegm6e,mq1jil,Donor-conceived child here! I was conceived in the 90s and at the time non-anonymous donation was not common Ive known I was donor-conceived since I was 13 years old I had always been curious about the donor and any potential siblings but was too scared to dig deep or do any testing In 2019 my mom gifted me a 23&me kit for Christmas and my results matched me with 2 half siblings One of them had done a DNA test through another service and connected with the donors father who then connected her to the donor (lets call him John) I was also connected with two more half siblings via 23&me about a month later John and I started talking through email and discovered that he grew up literally 30 minutes from me He is married and has one daughter with his wife They moved out of state a few years ago but they regularly come back to visit family and so Ive had the opportunity to meet John & his family twice now along with his wifes two sisters & their husbands (who live in the same city) Ive also met 2 of my donor-conceived half siblings I have an amazing relationship with John & his family The best way to describe it is somewhere in between family & close family friends As for my siblings we video chat about once a month and have a "sibs" group text Pre-covid we were planning to do a group vacation in the summer to meet each other Were all vaccinated at this point and so its currently on the table for this year My mom and dad are fully aware of my relationship with everyone in my "donor fam" and they both think its a really neat thing At one point I worked up the courage to talk to my dad about how he felt and he didnt seem upset or bothered I let him know hed always be my dad and John will always be John Honestly I cant imagine a world where things could have gone any better One of the most interesting things Ive found is how much genetics truly play a role in who are as people Every single one of us grew up in different households but yet we all have cross-over in interests personality traits and quirks that put together are too specific to be coincidence I love them all and get so excited every time I think about what the growth of our relationship will look like over time,Mynameisnot______,16183398520,42
guf9zw0,mq1jil,I was asked 3x before I took it seriously By friends struggling to get pregnant 1 heterosexual couple first Then a lesbian couple friends with my gf at the time The third was an ex gf pulling the old "If I get too close to 40 and havent met someone would you donate?" At this point I considered maybe Ive got something people need/want I myself was raised by my adopted mom and step adopted dad My step adopted dad had been contacted by his long lost son He never knew about He had a summer fling at 17 The girl had gotten pregnant He never knew Her family forced her to give the baby away So I saw their reunion play out Then 3-4 years later I found my own biological mom Then a few months later I found my dad Using 23andMe I felt like if I do my best to be a good person and live a good life any kids I might have might want a chance to develop a real relationship with me So long as the terms around how they were conceived make them feel good Valued Loved So I posted in a 2-3 fb groups Had over 200 couples contact me I made a spreadsheet of the 5 factors I wanted in a family I helped start Many of those couples were just testing the waters Some people had terrible reasons for wanting a family Or were completely unprepared I did connect well with 1 lesbian couple They now have a year and a half old son I almost met him but then covid hit The original 3 who asked me have come and gone Never donated for any of them It felt weird for me at the time But as I said After the 3rd request after thinking about my experience finding my biological parents Seeing my step adopted dad find his son I felt like it was something Id be okay doing I always wanted a big family anyways I have a 25 year old daughter with my gf right now Then my/their son was born 6 days shy of a year after my daughter Think Ill raise 2 kids myself Then help 3-5 more couples if its a good fit But with the pandemic and all havent been looking or anything My reasons are my adopted parents showed me the value of families created by people who want kids Meeting my biological mom showed me how to not live life if you want to bond when your kids find you My biological dad and step adopted dad showed me if youre a good person and the conditions around the conception are ok theres potential for a real relationship I like that thought Having half a dozen or more kids,skillz4success,16183536620,13
guftpfs,mq1jil,I donated for a few years in college I did 23andMe and opted to show who I matched with family-wise and sure enough there was someone in there that shared fifty percent of my DNA There were pictures of the kid and she looked to be about twelve I sent her a message because I figured they might be looking for me and sure enough the mom responded and said thanks and that shed like to have me to talk to the kid We arranged a phone call and the kid asked me some questions she said that I looked nice on the pictures and she was always really curious about me She doesnt have any siblings and there is no dad and she said shes gotten picked on a little for not having a papa That was just before Covid It is pretty weird because this person looks quite a lot like my family members but shes a total stranger,TootieTits,16183638520,11
gugub52,mq1jil,Im another descendant but Ive got a wild story let me tell you I didnt know either until about late 2019 either and with COVID I havent been able to track him down (hi if youre here granddad) So IVF was very very new barely existed My grandmother had a stillbirth due to a lack of progesterone Her obgyn really supported her emotionally when her husband (who didnt even want kids apparently) didnt My grandma was a good Catholic wife though you cant divorce easily And he wasnt exactly helpful in making babies but was a womanizer outside the home So grandma had an idea She asked her obgyn if he could *help* her have children This resulted in my dad and his older brother Supposedly he pulled all the stops for prenatal care and still has their photos on his desk at work last time she saw him My grandfather is a Jewish obgyn and Im just completely bamboozled Does explain a few things but what *What*? Anyway she waited until her second husband died to say anything My dad didnt know Hell he didnt know her second husband wasnt his bio dad until he was 16 poor guy Understandably my dad avoids feeling emotions and has trust issues So anyway anyone want to help me track down my grandpa if hes still alive or figure out how many cousins I might have?,lakeghost,16183898670,0
gygsxkm,nehqa9,We were only allowed walking one way in the halls at my middle school (This was 6 years before covid) because kids would apparently get lost? If our class was next door we would get suspended for bolting to the second class to avoid walking from the first floor up three levels and back down making you walk around the school wice before being able to go into your class on the first floor This is the same school that let live chickens into it to wander around one year for some reason,MaeOneyz,16212714130,6

Sorry no point Leadership conference with your youth group? Sorry no point *You have fucking COVID*? Sorry no point Earlier this year I was told to put a student on academic probation because their grade had slipped to a C That student had COVID and despite missing classes they kept up with all of the assignments by reading the class notes and emailing me with questions The reason she had a C: over a weeks worth of missing participation points and because it was so early in the quarter there werent enough other points to offset the loss Stuff like that is one of the reasons I left teaching,Guimauvaise,16213005400,2

gyj6flc,nehqa9,Im a high school teacher After reopening from COVID our principal insists we come to school to empty classrooms to stand guard over ghostly chairs and tables while we teach our classes via Zoom After three weeks fewer than 50 kids out of 2000 come to the school why bother when youll be sitting in a room all day taking classes over Zoom? So I drive to work get on my computer and then drive home without seeing one student in person The best part? He has administrators stationed at the parking lots to make sure no one leaves home early The few kids who are at the school are done by 2:30 but he insists the staff stay on campus until 3:30 for "office hours" The irony is no one can come on campus without being COVID tested and approved by the district so there is no point to being in an office Many schools decided to shut back down But not us!

gysn38s,nehqa9,Literally only one of our security guards actually cares about this rule and gosh darn is she strict about it So once my school opened back up after being closed cause of covid we had more restrictions obviously But the weirdest one was that they painted arrows on the floor of the hallways We were only supposed to go in the direction of the arrows to "keep us safe" The thing is that most classes were easier to access if you went opposite of the arrows One time I was literally in the doorway of my classroom but was yelled at to go back and go all the way around since I had gone in the opposite direction of those gosh darn arrows I got marked absent and had to call the school to change it to a tardy People get yelled at all the time,LousLaw,16214935650,2

He saw the puzzled look on my face so he continued "oh yeah  most people dont know it but the Satanists have a base hidden on the moon And they use it to control satellites around the Earth that shoot lasers and blah blah blah" (At this point my ears had shut down and I let him ramble on and on about Satanists pedos and how Trump was gonna save us from them all) The thing is this guy looked and seemed so perfectly normal up till then As I was leaving the diner I passed another guy coming into the diner that was surely letting his *freak flag* fly (multi-colored Mohawk hairdo nail polish (different color for each finger) and a generally creepy vibe about him) The whole experience reminded me of a rap song from the 80s: "The Freaks Come Out at Night",jgb75,16224079980,2
gzwryfc,nns8ge,I worked at a gas station and we had a regular (40ish F) that came in about once week but suddenly she disappeared for a while (this story is all pre COVID) When she came back I did my usual "hey how you doing?" And she gave me the run down "Oh when I was 14 my parents were in a cult and married me off to a 25 year old cult member Well I finally escaped that abusive relationship He hit me all the time and forced me to have two children with him before I was 20 Well there was a man I met closer to my age at a New years party when I was 19 on my then-husbands side of the family this year me and my husband finally divorced and today Im marrying that man I met at the New Years party many years ago" I had never said more than hello to this woman Needless to say I am more cautious of asking strangers how theyre doing,kennysmithy,16223225510,1

hahp34u,pbzt5b,Owing people an explanation When I was in my twenties I felt I needed to explain why I couldnt date a guy who asked why I couldnt work late why I couldnt dine with friends or why I couldnt attend a wedding Then one day I just thought "fukkit" I dont owe anybody an explanation I dont have to explain any decisions I make or give reasons I just would say no thank you I cant be there I cant date you I am unable to attend and leave it at that When people would ask why Id say "so I have to tell you all my business now?"

hahsn8a,pbzt5b,Getting on psych meds For whatever reason I always thought I was some kind of crazy that medicine had never seen Turns out I have the two mental illnesses that can be almost almost completely fixed with meds but will utterly destroy your mind and life without them Then I saw a psychiatrist I went on adderall in March 2020 for ADHD and mood stabilizers for Bipolar 1 in January At the beginning of Covid I was failing out of college after three major changes all of which I hated I was barely holding a job at Starbucks I was completely unstable and well on my way to losing my mind Ive since given up that miserable life to open a painting business I have kept myself busy and paid all of my bills ever since By April I killed my last full blown manic episode and Ive been stable ever since My business has improved with my mind and by now Im making at least 10k a month Im so grateful for every day I get to spend like this Two years ago I was ready to die in my 20s from a hard and fast lifestyle Being on the right meds has let me stop self medicating Ive quit all drugs and Im moderating my alcohol to a low risk level Im eating healthy and taking care of myself I present myself like a professional I make my clients happy and my job is so rewarding I never thought it would be possible but I feel normal and Im successful My doctor has saved my life,Sergeant-Pepper-,16300235190,3

hagkuuy,pbzt5b,Bidet I used to have to wipe until my butt bled even as a baby my mother said she felt like it was like wiping off tar I dreaded having to poop just because it took me so long Bought a bidet while drunk during the height of COVID no toilet paper drama and Ive never looked back It was like going through life thinking the world was sulky and grey and suddenly seeing in color for the first time I immediately realized my ass has never been totally clean my entire life Wet wipes get close but you always feel a little bit of residue or weird left over Not with the bidet!

hagt5so,pbzt5b,Leaving a job and industry that was wearing on my soul I absolutely love the people I worked with but I was so burned out by the end of my time there that I was more of a liability than an asset to them and I feel terrible about that I should have left much sooner than I did (I was in the industry for just short of 6 years and at that company for 3 and a half of them) and had started looking for a new job just before COVID hit and that changed everything Though truthfully I should have starting looking for a new job much sooner I spent most of COVID self-medicating and contacted mental health hotlines multiple times during shutdown I slept maybe 3-4 hours a night and when I did sleep had frequent nightmares about work It was really dark days By the time the world started opening back up I was so depressed that it still took months to start seriously looking moving jobs - the job application process was really hard on me and made me feel about 5 inches tall 10 years of experience in similar positions most jobs were trying to pay me around what I was making right out of college around $13 an hour I still took a bit of a pay cut when I accepted my current job and the commute is worse but I dont regret it Its been two months and I havent had to stay late once I havent driven home in tears at all and no more stress hives! I have so much more autonomy it feels like what I do matters and I can genuinely say I enjoy my job Everyone in my life has commented at how much happier and freer I have seemed since making the switch Just wish I could have done it sooner!,sayhellotojenn,16300080360,2

hah8ivc,pbzt5b,Mindfulness - people dont get it but its an amazing way to learn to create distance between *you* and *your thoughts* They are not the same thing These days I can think about things that scare the life out of me without panicking worrying or getting stressed The thought enters I acknowledge it and it goes away again I even sleep better Proper sleep hygiene - this never mattered to me until I got Covid and it gave me unbelievable insomnia I went from being someone who just slept when they did because lol never mind to someone for whom every single thing I did in a day felt like it affected how well I slept and how well I slept directly affected how I felt all the next day Simple things like exercising a little more eating the right things at the right time stretching before bed and properly winding down have me going to sleep faster sleeping deeper and actually feeling calm and rested when I wake up I never realised how shit my sleep was Waking up used to be excruciating but these days its all much more relaxing process Honesty - about 8 years ago I decided I was going to be absolutely honest all the time with everyone This doesnt mean being obnoxious or rude offering up opinions nobody asked for or being indelicate but I will not say anything that isnt true and honestly my relationships are better because people Im just not gunna get on with work that out faster and we dont waste energy and likewise people who I will work that out faster too Im doing better at work Im a better husband Being completely honest without being a twat is hard but very possible Ive learned a lot,ITheRook,16300143620,2

gxyskv2,nbaar5,I wasnt physically there but heard enough stories to get the idea My best friends older sister got married last December during covid They got engaged in August and she immediately decided on a wedding 4 months later Her family advised her against it since covid was due to spike around that time but she insisted Ive always known her as a controlling whiny bitch so I could so see her just throwing a fit about it They could only do a guest list of 50 people at the time due to covid so they got those invites out pretty quickly but as the family predicted 4 days before the wedding the venues capacity went down to 25 Bride insisted the 25 were cut from grooms side instead of her side huge fight ensued but he somehow bowed down to her and let only his parents and siblings be invited Cue to 2 days before the wedding everyone has to prove they tested negative for covid in order to be in the venue Grooms mom tests positive so groom freaks out and tries to postpone the wedding last minute Brides mom is an even more controlling bitch than the bride so the mom stepped in and insisted the wedding goes on Who cares if the entire wedding is just brides family? Get over yourself groom! This is about the bride! Both sides of the family get into huge fights grooms family says if he actually goes through with it hes crazy and his parents and all 3 of his siblings (including sisters who were bridesmaids) decide they arent coming any more Bride and groom fight leading up to the wedding since she and her mom still demanded the wedding goes on Morning of the wedding the groom is still freaking out trying to cancel so they were still arguing as shes getting ready The getting ready photos are on Facebook and theyre so noticeably awkward and you can just tell there were fights going on Somehow the wedding goes on and reception afterwards where there was obviously no dancing and everyone basically had to be glued to their chairs I asked my friend about how the reception went and she just kinda said "as good as it could be" but I can just tell shes trying to hide the fact that it was a shit show since its her familys fault Theres only 1 photo total of the reception and it also just looked so awkward Its been half a year and I know the professional photos got back but I havent seen any posted of the bride and groom together so I wouldnt be surprised if they were fighting so much they decided not to take them or looked pissed in them,ginowie97,16209055590,239
gy26kae,nbaar5,Im a POC (context) Last year I was invited to an interracial wedding in the South RIGHT after George Floyd was killed So racial tensions was THICKA THAN A SNICKER! The venue had two separate ballrooms and the guests kind of divided themselves by race it was awkward af! Finally the DJ plays that song Wobble and by now the open bar of drinks had worked its magic and people were dancing Finally things are starting to look promising until I tasted the Shrimp N Grits which I will rename Shit N Grits Literally everyone who ate the Shit N Grits got food poisoning including the Groom who drunkenly ate (2) bowls of the poison flower girls ALL THE GUESTS me! We thought we caught covid due to the flu like symptoms! The groom spent 4 days of the honeymoon with explosive diarrhea in the beginning followed by hibernation Grizzly Bear constipation after he created a "butt plug" with every OTC medication to stop the explosive diarrhea Miserable! The bride didnt eat any so she traveled to 4 different pharmacies to collect all these meds! Mercy I personally had 1 1/2 spoonfuls of the Shit N Grits that Saturday evening and recall being at Church Sunday morning the next day and my stomach DROPPING! I panicked literally starting sweating and immediately left church speeding home to try to unleash this demon in my own personal toilet I got off the highway and almost went to the QT gas station (theyre always clean) because I didnt think I could make it to my 3rd floor apartment But then I realized Im going to shit in this dress so you might as well drive the extra mile home so I dont leave a crime scene at this gas station! I made it home unleashed the dragon and concluded that 2020 really was the year of toilet paper and shit shows! Sooo yeah it was a pretty shitty event True story!

gy0jsj3,nbaar5,Lol mine TLDR; Nothing catastrophic but just not a single thing went as planned & My wifes future sister in law kinda sucks At the end of the day we are bummed about it all but none of the little stuff really matters to us and were happy Terrible venue staff that are impossible to communicate with being notified of their covid restrictions two weeks before turning our guest list from 175 to 50 ( for the record not county city state or federal restrictions The venues) Then we had to cancel the week before The date was important to us so we decided to elope then have dinner with some family and bridal party Family wouldnt allow us to elope so we had a small ceremony that her parents manage to put together at the last minute We had our wedding attire altered and everything was good but just needed some really tiny adjustments When we went to pick up my suit and her dress after having them altered My suit was almost twice as big and her dress was butchered to the point that it looked like she was wearing an inter tube around her waist (From what was told to mestill havent seen that dress) So she goes with her future sister inlaw/bridesmaid to pick out a new dress for the impromptu ceremony Her brother offers to get a private room at a restaurant that he had connections with Which we would get at cost So significantly cheaper than what we had already reserved Happily accepted to help ease the financial burden with my inlaws insisting on covering everything So everything is going okay leading up to our makeshift ceremony Day of My wifes future sister in law was getting ready with her and driving her to the ceremony Wife was done (15 minutes late normal for her) and ready to go but Future inlaw wasnt done getting ready so my wife was 45 minutes late so future inlaw could spend 30 minutes to do lip plumper and touch up her hair (And we were up a mountain with no reception so no updates were getting to everyone waitingstarted to think she wasnt coming) But she of course makes it and our impromptu ceremony included crazy and freezing wind while being up a mountain Her waking down the dirt isle to a song we bothreally dont like And we had a custom piece arranged for her to walk down to But that was overlooked and wasnt used But none of it mattered were just happy to be married (Here is where the dumb part that were still dealing with comes in) We head to dinner (We havent even seen this restaurant or the room we got) We get there figure out where everything is and are trying to track down who ended up with our marriage license from the ceremony There are 5 seats less in the room than what we were told we could have But all good we played it safe and under invited The room had 2 tables seating 10 each So family and bridal party sorted themselves into the 2 tables The last 2 of the bridal part arrived but the only 2 seats left were at the family table So we asked my wifes brother and future in law to move the family table (they were both in the wedding part as well) Just so everyone is at a table with people they know Since hey had already gotten their drinks they said sure but reluctantly moved We could tell they were upset by that and we felt bad so we went and apologized again Explained we just tried to put everyone where they could enjoy themselves and offered to have them over for dinner in a few days to as a thank you Future sister in law proceeds to ignores everyone at dinner including the bride asking for photos Her brother comes over for dinner a few days later but shes apparently so mad at us that she doesnt come Fast forward a few months she hasnt talked to us but we keep hearing about how hurt she is So wife finally meets with her to talk Despite wife apologizing(again) future in law continues to tell my wife that its her job to make sure all of her guest feel important Then she is demanding that all we go to counseling together because we hurt her and made her feel unimportant We will not be going I left out a lot of the other small stuff that went wrong But its literally all of it haha,thebadgerbat,16209343280,21

I look back and have a good laugh If we could get through that fiasco we were going to be okay with future curveballs Still I fantasize about renewing our vows with a do-over one day It wouldve been nice to stay for the whole party,pontoponyo,16209191630,3

gy0p6fn,nbaar5,Not a ruined wedding but an amazing and interesting one that very easily could have been ruined had we not been so proactive and a bit lucky Mine and my wifes wedding First the original venue got flooded out and would take months to be back open (in fact 2 years after the flooding it is only half repaired due to covid and more floods) The day we got the call that the original venue was a no go (we had paid and it was just a month and a few days to the wedding or so) we went to grab lunch at a fast food place and saw a sign across the street for a dance studio that also was a wedding venue It was in an old shopping strip center that had housed a thrift store that my grandmother and I used to LOVE going to (she mostly raised me and was like my mom She passed away on my 17th birthday and this gave me a connection to her sort of being there) I called and they had an opening but a few weekend after the original planed date No problem we took it We built a beautiful light wall display and it got unloaded but only the frame and one strand of lights got put up before our friends decided to hang out and talk to each other Which is fine I guess but they had promised to help set up and it would have looked to amazing but ended up looking a bit jinky I made all the bridesmaid dresses and all the shirts for the groomsmen and best man due to the same flooding that hit the original venue and other issues there were weeks I could not work on them so literally finished the last shirt a few hours before the wedding The dresses were thankfully finished first It was a costume wedding and we got married by a Pirate Assassin Most of our guests were in costume It was pretty awesome My younger brother was my best man and we were in our kilts with a few Cherokee accoutrements (we are 1/2 Cherokee 1/2 Scot and 1/4 Irish) He also cooked much of the food Our food was a western (Texas) and Chinese Fusion We had soups Won Ton Egg Drop and Hot and Sour Egg Rolls Vegetarian Fried Rice Dumplings Brisket Grilled Chicken Breasts (Brisket and chicken expertly cooked by my brother)Green Beans (my grandmothers recipe made by my aunt With ham and chicken stock and OMG they are so good) Salad And a few other things Her cake was Lemon Curd and something else Mine was 1/2 German Chocolate 1/2 Carrot Cake (my two favs) and mine was diabetic friendly and in the shape of our Firefly Fan Group logo The drinks were in a large ice chest which leaked As it was in a dance studio they were not happy about that BUT it got cleaned up immediately and no harm done the drinks were put in another ice chest and all drinks and food were moved to another are of the studio that had tile floors Now when we got the tour of the studio and booked it the woman told us we would have full usage of the entire place including dressing room and practice room and so on well the owner showed up and told us we could not use the dressing and practice rooms which we were currently using to get into wedding clothes ect So I gave him an extra $100 bucks and he relented and was happy And yes we got this place REALLY CHEAP!!! It was about 1/10th of the cost of the original venue And close to the house so that was nice (Sadly the dance studio closed down due to covid But the owner plans on reopening soon) We had an app (a decent DJ program) that we put out music into and a person was supposed to dj it they ended up not showing up due to a medical issue then the app decided to be corrupt and not work So I and 2 friends DJed my own wedding lol It started a bit lame but worked out really well My father well he and my step mother brought his new puppy and he sat out in his vehicle with it most of the time He and my step mom left after the first dance No real loss there There is a lot of friction between he and my mom Or that was my thinking and it was a part of it BUT My wifes mother insulted my step mom and my older brothers wife (he could not be there but she and their kids were) and I did not find this out until recently I would rather they leave than there have been drama My wifes mother is a bit of an elitist She is a good person but does the back handed compliments and so forth Now some loved ones could not make it and that is okay and we are in no way upset other than missed spending time with them And we love that those that made it were there and it was awesome SO while our wedding was not ruined so many parts of it could have been But we all persevered And it was the most amazing day our my life When my bride walked out to come down the isle I started UGLY crying she looked so beautiful and serene I cried the entire time and it was funny no one could understand my vows The Minister a dear friend started tearing up as well (so many in our life were just waiting for us to get married) We had to stop the ceremony and hug it out LOL When there is love there nothing is ruined it may just not be what you planned And that is okay,redfeather1,16209365150,3
gy14w10,nbaar5,My own wedding was ruined on multiple fronts We were planning to get married May 2020 and then COVID hit which I want to specify isnt what ruined the wedding In July a major mistake was made at my now-husbands workplace and he was dropped from his insurance It was almost the height of the pandemic and we were worried what would happen if he got sick so we acted quickly to get him officially on my insurance Our parents were pissed we were going to do a courthouse wedding so I compromised and planned/set-up for an intimate backyard wedding with immediate family in 4 days However none of our parents wanted to help with anything because they were either upset we werent inviting people that they wanted to come or were upset that I wasnt letting them choose how to do things All our siblings were invited minus a formal invitation to one of my step-sisters (20F) because she said she hated me and refused to attend my wedding (sad drama leading up to that one actually) We werent ever super close but I still always tried to be a good sister to her growing up and it was extremely hurtful and devastating to me To top it off my step-mom felt since one step-sister wasnt going then my other step-sis (15F) who I am close with could not attend and sent her off to be with her dad until it was over Day of the wedding my mom shows up drunk my mother-in-law shows up wearing a knock-off of my dress (I wore a very specific floral dress and didnt think anything of it when she asked for pictures before the wedding) my little step-sister bursts in after the ceremony and sobs in my arms that shes so sorry she missed my wedding and that she tried so hard to get there but no one would drive her and then my already drunk mom and step-dad drank all of the champagne after we opened it without letting anyone else get any which of course led to them being more drunk they became extremely sexually inappropriate Then before I could make any announcements on social media or to other family members our parents posted and shared everything that night before I could even get to it because I was busy cleaning up :( A lot of people got their feelings hurt because of it and I still feel so horrible that it all happened the way it did Were planning a redemption wedding in the next year so Im hopeful that one will go better!!,BiotechPrincess,16209436610,5

gx2y95p,n5mj47,When I was 28 I found out that my dad was not my biological father The news came out via the following: my dad was battling depression and was suicidal so I had just flown home to try to take care of him and rescue him from my moms wrath My mom had verbally and emotionally abused him during their entire relationship He loved her so much and he tolerated it Well during a solemn walk w/ my dad as I tried to help him out he confided that hes not my biological dad and he went on to tell me he knew this all along but my mom lied to him and tried to convince him that he was my biological father He knew he wasnt but he wanted to play the role When I was 10 years old my mom finally confessed this to him and he was worried that upon hearing the news officially hed somehow let this affect his relationship with me So when I was 28 years old during this walk w/ my dad as he pours out this story to me he frames it by telling me that his two most proud items in his life are: (1) how I turned out / his raising me; (2) that he had completely forgot about the news my mom told him earlier in that day (when I was 10) about him not being my biological father and that it was only upon tucking me in at night (when I was 10) that it briefly crossed his mind It was at that point that he knew nothing would ever come between us and our father-son relationship would be as awesome as ever He also confided that my mom did hard drugs while pregnant with me and this broke his heart to witness firsthand They were very poor My dad grew up in a foster home without parents My mom grew up w/ 6 siblings and ill-equipped parents She dropped out of 9th grade whereas all of her other siblings dropped out earlier -- many of them are barely literate Im now mid-30s and tragically my dad committed suicide mid-March 2020 right as COVID was hitting I was out of the country at the time but immediately flew 30 hours (30-min layover) and made it in time for his funeral I do everything in his honor **[UPDATE:]** Wow this thread blew up overnight! My most popular comment by 2 orders of magnitude and its about my sorrow Im just glad so many of you read about how amazing my dad was and I truly appreciate the outpour of kind thoughtful words and wishes It warms my heart I could go on and on with countless examples about how amazing he was After graduating from the orphanage at age 18 he moved up to Atlanta by himself and taught himself woodworking He was incredible and would build fine-furniture pieces for renowned interior decorators and his items would be in magazines all the time He was a starving artist -- we always struggled to get by Yet I felt like a spoiled kid on my street as I had life easier than everyone else (the other kids on my street lived in trailer-homes and had very chaotic households) and it was clear that both of my parents loved me immensely and I felt very well-provided for and supported I was very lucky to have him in my life I still think about him daily and Im trying to improve emotionally I appreciate everyone sharing your own similar stories and it provides a sense of camaraderie Hearing the shared pain and empathy and seeing that this resonated with so many people it motivates me to finally write a Short Stories book that would include snippets from my relationship with him For those interested in reading more about him: **[EXERPT FROM MY EULOGY TO HIM WHICH I WROTE WHEN FLYING TO HIS FUNERAL]** **2 His hard work** For my entire upbringing he worked every single day in his shop for long hours  didnt even take a day off for Christmas or his birthday As a kid I witnessed his work ethic and it forever left an impression on me Importantly he didnt appear as if he was working for someone else; he was working for himself He found what he loved  woodworking  and he completely immersed himself into and dedicated his life to making perfectly crafted items because he wanted to He had passion a pursuit of perfection and an unlimited tank of dedication to fuel it He didnt just make items He didnt just work He made masterpieces When I was 18 and left home to go to college I aspired to be like my dad He set the example I was trying to make something of myself and to really give it my all just like he did His work ethic was ingrained in me I would get 4-5 hours of sleep many nights every week For years It was hard but I always thought about how much harder my dad worked I would recall memories of him working in his shop late at night: Id hear the saws spinning; The compressor running; memories of huge sawdust piles under his table-saw He did so much to provide for our family He always provided I remember being a kid hanging out with him in his shop admiring his dedication to the craft and strive for perfection So when I was 18 starting college I was trying to make him proud and I was also trying to do everything I could so that Id have the opportunity to do anything I want in this world Not just for myself but on behalf of my dad A part of me felt that whatever opportunity I gained whatever success I had it was in hopes that he too would somehow benefit That he could vicariously get what he deserved He deserved the world and Ive just been trying to channel his hard work and do my part Anything Ive accomplished its because of my dad **3 His creative problem solving abilities** Not only did my dad work relentlessly hard but he masterfully found creative solutions to everything He truly dedicated his life to solving problems and designing furniture for others There is no physical item he could not figure out His ability to do so was way beyond anything Ive ever witnessed None of my colleagues at MIT Harvard Brown or whatever fancy place Ive worked at could remotely come close to having my dads unique ability to creatively make things work Whatever the problem my dad could find a solution When he was 12 he was excited once he learned that you could repair some radios just by replacing the diodes When I was a kid he made me an incredible tree house with its own electricity line When I was a teenager there was a large ice storm in Georgia that caused half a million homes to lose power for up to a week our house included My dad had an old portable black and white TV He grabbed his car battery and rigged it up so that we could watch TV for days despite not having power His vehicles over the years had so many contraptions and workarounds they were often like modern day Flintstones cars This was how he did things his entire life **5 His strength and character** His perseverance was unmatched He handled so much adversity over the years especially the past 10 years when he was in so much pain He was the strongest person Ive ever met Hands down In recent years he experienced and recovered from Stevens-Johnsons syndrome a rare horrific deadly skin disorder that covers the entire body He was resilient beyond belief and he endured so many personal obstacles that were thrown his way His strength wasnt just in his ability to endure but in his bravery I have many stories from my childhood where he stepped us to save the day in crises He was fearless Not only was he courageous in his character but he was also physically strong as an ox It was uncanny In his 60s he could often lift more than I could in my 30s despite my being really into weightlifting but Ill spare you the fun humbling details **6 Vulnerability and gentleness** Once I became an adult he was strong enough to admit to me tough moments in his life He was willing to confide in me painful times that he endured He was willing to call on me for help and to tell me when he felt he wasnt strong enough We all feel this way at times He was vulnerable to cry He showed me that ones willingness to show vulnerability is in fact a product of strength and bravery **11 Closing** As I close I want to mention one of my favorite artists Alanis Morissette who has a stanza that challenges us by asking: "How bout remembering your divinity? How bout unabashedly bawling your eyes out? How bout not equating death with stopping?" To this effect I know that my dad will continue to inspire me and influence me for the rest of my life without question I am who I am because of him Ive always aspired to uphold the principles and he stood for And I hope that others see in me his virtues and pieces of his personality I want to continue his legacy Thus he hasnt stopped Further I challenge all of you to do the same in never equate death with stopping That is we can do better than just remembering someone; we can do better than just remembering my dad We can continue to learn from what hes taught us the elements Ive mentioned today: 1 When you find something you love whether its work or a hobby put everything you have into it 2 Be willing to think creatively to solve problems 3 Take the time to enjoy the so-called minutia in life the alleged trivial details make it significant 4 Be willing to play and be silly; dont take yourself too seriously 5 Be brave Be strong Be so strong that youre willing to be vulnerable 6 Be a teacher and be a lifelong student 7 Mean everything you say and speak earnestly 8 Connect with others; form a community And be there for others We could all benefit from the help of others so be unafraid to rely on others for support I would do anything to have my dad with us here today In his own words which he often told me: "its not what happens to you but how you handle it" So again I urge you all to *handle* this tragedy by staying strong connecting with community and the support of others and continuing to learn from my dad Thank you all for being here It means the world to me and I know it means the world to my dad,stillworkin,16202531660,8127
gx2muyq,n5mj47,I have two secret child stories My grandmother on my moms side got pregnant at 16 She was forced to travel halfway across the country to give birth in secret and come back like it never happened This secret came out before I was born My grandmother and both of her children always wanted to find their other sibling but were unable due to legal reasons 6 or 7 years ago my uncle got a phone call from the adopted child who had decided to look for his biological family after his adopted parents had passed away Unfortunately his biological mother (my grandmother) had passed away in 2001 While he does still live halfway across the country he is certainly a welcomed part of our family now Before covid there were annual visits but of course those had to stop for the time being And a great great aunt on my dads side (my dads dads mothers brothers wife haha) had also secretly given a child up as a teenager Two years ago at my great great uncles birthday his wifes adopted child was there News to me and my dad but of course welcomed! The closer family had known about her for a while by that point We are a big and relatively close family but only saw the more distant relatives on special occasions Unfortunately a year later my great great aunt passed away It was sad seeing the rest of her children sat up front at the funeral with the adopted daughter sat towards the back and if my memory serves me correctly not mentioned in the obituary I wasnt really privy to the details maybe this was the way she wanted it? But I felt bad seeing her hardly acknowledged at her biological mothers funeral I had the feeling she wanted to be accepted and part of the family if she were attending birthday parties,Gloomy_Garbage,16202481890,150
gx4308v,n5mj47,I never grew up with a father Me and 4 other siblings Younger bro from another guy who was never around either My dad lived down the street from us He would drive by with his new wife/girlfriend Id be playing in the front yard and would get excited and wave as he went by and would proudly tell my freinda there goes my dad! Dont know why Years later at 23 What I thought was a rumor from my aunt to my wife after she told her that my real dad was looking for me I told my wife shes just starting shit to spite my mom and she should mind her own business It Lingered around for a while in my mind as I suspected could possibly be true because it made sense as cold as my dad was I get home one day at 37 I go to my man cave and grab a beer told my wife I need time after the day I hear the phone ring and on the TV is the caller ID and its the name of my rumored father I am fkn frozen I hear my wife answer and she knocks on door and says its your dad! I spoke with him and hes talking fast and Im guessing because he thinks Im going to hang up I told him to relax and spoke with him for a while He then says I need to get home please answer when I call you brothers and sisters would live to talk to you! Holy shit! I assured him he calls back and I speak to my 15 yr old brother 8 yr old bro and 12 yr old sis He was looking for me since I was 23 He says he spoke with a woman when he found a number and got the courage to call He says he was told to leave me alone that I wanted to have nothing to do with him That I was a man now and no longer needed him To this day we have no idea who that was He lost hope and stop searching till I was 37 and his new wife encouraged him to I lost all those years I got the courage to ask my existing siblings and my mom and no one denied he was my dad No one ever told me Led me to believe the other guy was my dad What the fuck! Everyone knew even uncles and aunts It was a huge secret by everyone except me WTF! I decided to grow my relationship with him which was great for about 9 years Covid took him in January I am glad I opened up to accept him and we did what we could while we could I would visit and would go swimming in the river and other things with my 1/2 brothers and sisters and forgot I was 37 yrs old I have no regrets besides my family stolen all that time I could have spent with him and who ever he talked to on the phone to turn him away I grew a successful company with the Last name of my dad on it with pride Now its not even my real name I feel I should rename it but its well known FML Sorry for long story couldnt stop writing Going to my oldest 1/2 brothers wedding on Saturday We all swore to stay close,Rangy,16202736780,10
gx2uwqx,n5mj47,My father told me I was supposed to have a little brother but my mother miscarried and never wanted my older sister (she was 4 at that time) and myself (2 at the time) to ever find out We ended up having another sister two years later but this was apparently a secret my mother wanted to take to the grave I only found out because my dad (parents have been divorced for 20 years) stopped by to visit my daughter for the first time a couple weeks ago (she was born just before the pandemic and my step-mother made it impossible for him to visit due to a medical condition Since she passed due to COVID my father was finally able to come out to visit in person My mother still doesnt know I know and my two sisters have no idea Im not sure I should say anything to anyone I dont think it is a huge deal and my mother should absolutely not feel any shame about it but I think it is more a sensitive subject since apparently she was pretty far along I also found out my great grandfather was murdered during the Great Depression while working on the railroads in Chicago but the police refused to do anything since my family were immigrants and the police were pretty racist back then We will never know who did it but only the why - he was a semi wealthy immigrant and someone wanted him dead for both things,suprisegoutattack,16202516590,7

gx48ndk,n5mj47,Okay really recently a low-key family bombshell was dropped and I havent talked to anyone about it okay so for context: in the 60s my dad married his first wife had three kids and adopted two very US nuclear family then he went to Vietnam was in the army for about 20 years they divorced in the early 80s My mom and dad met some time after that and eloped in the later 80s (my favorite photo ever is the only photo from their elopement which was on a boat off the coast of mexico if I remember correctly?) It caused a HUGE family fight on my moms side because my mothers Irish Catholic parents were horrified that their 19 year old eloped with a war veteran more than twice her age who already had 5 kids and an ex-wife it also caused a HUGE fight on my dads side because my mom was the same age as one of my dads daughters and they were already not thrilled about their parents divorce to begin with but eventually everyone got over it theres a lot of love in my family which is always wanna stress when I talk about this stuff because on paper my dad can sound kinda don draperish and patriarchal and bleh and idk I wasnt there but my maternal grandparents eventually came around and my dads kids forgave him I think because he was just a genuine gentle giant he was 64" and was just very warm and kind naturally boomingly loud voice loved to eat anything could fall asleep anywhere anytime and absolutely adored all of his kids he and my mom had a really happy marriage and had me and my 5 siblings He died in 2005 of cancer okay thats the overly detailed context Jump to 2020 my brother and I were at my moms for mothers day my other siblings werent there because of COVID restrictions my brother was going through my moms filing cabinet because he had recently gotten obsessed with learning more about our dad since he had died when we were young and never wanted to talk about his time in the army there was a lot of gray area for us so he was digging through documents and stuff And boy oh boy did he learn more! Amid his birth and death certificates and pictures and shit my brother found an envelope addressed to our dad from circa 2007 it was from a personal investigator who had been trying to find/reach out to my dad for years for over a decade on the behalf of a young Vietnamese woman who had spent the majority of her adult life searching for her father an American soldier who had dated (and unknowingly impregnated) her mother during the Vietnam war her mother said that they had lost contact after he left Vietnam and she didnt know until after he was gone that she was pregnant The piping hot tea that we learned after questioning our mother is apparently my dad and his first wife were quietly separated for a lot of their marriage and he was dating a vietnamese woman while he was deployed Their daughter basically only had his name some of his army information and a photo of the two of them to go off of when she hired a private investigator to help her find her father once she was an adult This letter from the PI got to my mother about 2 years after my dad died My mom told my dads ex-wife about the letter and she asked my mom not to tell any of us she was worried about how her kids would react especially since this was before ancestrycom and they couldnt "prove it" yet She feels bad that she didnt respond to her back then but she was a single mom with six kids and was still grieving I dont blame her for not responding But she encouraged my brother to respond when he found the letter last May Long story short I have a half sister I didnt know about! The DNA results just officially came in a few weeks ago and confirmed it She lives in a different part of the US as my family but she her husband and their dog took a road trip to come meet us theyre extremely lovely people and I really really wish she couldve met our dad they wouldve loved each other my mom said she and I both have our dads chin,Positive_Amphibian,16202774700,2
gx4dx05,n5mj47,Couldnt visit my great grandad due to covid and my nan (his daughter) was his carer She rang us randomly after not speaking to us for ages saying my great grandad was dying Visited him the day after and she had been starving him and not giving him his proper cancer and pain meds (she hadnt even told us he had cancer) by the time we got involved he was the weight of a 11 year old child (he was 91 by the way) I will NEVER forgive her and my mum and I have cut her out of our lives My nan is a murderer and a thief she stole all of his money while he was alive and took all the money when he passed My mum and I (both disabled/mentally ill) cared for him best we could while he was still alive we got social services involved and they did nothing doctors did nothing nurses that came in to see him did nothing rest of the family did nothing except my cousin and uncle I dont talk to my family anymore (except my mum obviously) This happened when I was 17,sixsinc,16202814880,2
gx4hmnc,n5mj47,So my nan (she died of COVID recently at 97) was a strange women I loved her She was estranged from two of her kids but my mum loved her loads She definitely had some form of undiagnosed mental health problem I suspect from years of abuse and disadvantage She had a breakdown when the kids were young because of repeated cheating and mistreatment by my grandad She left the kids when my mum was a baby and so the story goes she put them in a childrens home and walked away She was always seen as the evil one for this The story goes that she arrived back and took them out of the childrens home and it was never mentioned again She refused to talk about it When she died it came out that she actually left the kids with their dad who couldnt be bothered to look after them She left when he had taken the older two to meet one of his girlfriends and then cleaned out their bank accounts so that she couldnt it uniform for the kids She just cracked and went to take a job in a seaside town He left them with him parents and together they decided to put them in the childrens home My nan found out that they had put them into care and came back and fought really hard to get them back Grandad tried to stop her getting them out of care When she got the kids back they lived in extreme poverty whilst she sued grandad using laws that had only just been put in place for cruelty and abuse She won and he had a hefty amount of money to pay per month which was extremely unusual To get out of this he took a job in another country Soon after he died in an accident (he was a miner) and eventually Nan received his pension Which was excellent She lived an ok life and never told any of her kids what had happened The older two hated her because they felt abandoned She lived a fairly secure but unhappy live hating men throughout She caused an untold amount of trouble wherever she went She was my idol,Beatplayer,16202845720,2

gzsu7o8,nmy1er,Taking supplements! All these people online that encourage the over use of supplements this can be detrimental to ones health!! Taking too much vitamen C- too much vitamen C can cause calcium oxalate crystals to form in the kidneys as they have to work to push this solute out sometimes it builds up Taking vitamen C is great in moderation id suggest a low dose maybe 60-75 mg no more than 3x a week We get a great deal of what we need from our food! Herbal suppliments- some of these have not been approved and different combinations of them can be carcinogens take with caution! Vitamen D AK yes again good in moderation its fat soluble and deposits take time to deplete do not take everyday! Melotonin- becoming reliant upon this is bad for many reasons- this one is best to take at random intervals Random means the body doesnt become dependent upon this suppliment as when the body expects certian things to be delivered at a certian time it will stop making its own chemicals in order to save energy and resources Melotonin and serotonin go hand in hand but too much of this building block can cause there to be too much serotonin floating around creating the opposite effect desired Not intended for those on seizure meds pregnant those w rls or on antidepressants Ive seen a ton of younger patients w kidney stones this year trying to boost the immunity to covid not knowing they are causing damage Be careful what you take and how often remember suppliments should be supplemented in a shortage for example if you cant get enough iron from your diet you can suppliment it in to make sure you dont become anemic! Suppliments arent regulated and far too many people are taking them too often stay safe folks!,entrapta_embodied,16222340480,1

h0awr18,nq9fjc,Hotel employee here for many many years I believe were considered a 4 star but my god I wouldnt give it even two lol I could literally write a thousand lines of information regarding behind the scenes drama and bullshit some that probably doesnt affect the guest so much as it does make the employees lives a living hell So for brevitys sake: Just because that sign outside says "Hilton" it doesnt mean that it is actually owned or operated by Hilton In fact the local "management and development company" that owns my place of work also owns a lot of hotels that you would rightly assume to be "direct competition" but noooope This is an illusion of choice for the guest where as they may have a bad experience at this one particular Hilton property and wish to go stay at the Hyatt down the street completely oblivious to the fact that the same idiots in charge of the place they just swore up and down never to return to will be the same assholes pocketing your protest money Im not saying every Hilton hotel is like this as some of the more notable locations truly are owned and operated in house but a lot of them are just as I described My employer actually owns several Hiltons Hamptons Hyatts Marriotts etc you name it Also dont assume the suicidal looking individual behind the desk should cheer up as they are obviously getting paid the big bucks working at an illustrious Hilton hotel of all places!; if theyre like me they could actually be working for another (and more awful) company One with employees who are criminally underpaid overworked undervalued etc Ive seen my hotel rake in well over 15k in a single night yet any wage above the minimum for employees of several years is "beyond the budget" Housekeeping in particular also deals with some awful shit and truly are by far the most unfairly paid Also a relatively new one: Since COVID began our inspections have been done remotely How can that be done remotely you ask? The inspector will have a Zoom call between themselves and hotel management The inspector will instruct this management team to point the cameras in whatever device they are using towards different points in a room As you can imagine this is easily bullshitted Also inspections in general are very seldom done 2 times a year in most cases with the inspection of around 5-7 rooms total on a busy trip It also takes a LOT to lose your "flag" (aka the privilege of calling yourself *insert brand here*) Ive seen us float between "unacceptable" and "failure" for extended periods of time and alas we still got our flag Oh heres a good one: Review your stay Not just through the company directly but also on Yelp Travelocity Tripadvisor etc Hotel management really dont like negative reviews on third party sites lmao If a specific places MGMT dont seem too interested in hearing your bad experience I promise someone higher up will go into panic mode and do whatever it takes to save face once your bad experience becomes very public Through Hilton in particular they take "SALT scores" very seriously and it is even included in the scoring of those inspections I mentioned earlier I could go on for hours but I will just leave this comment with: Dont be too hard on general employees like housekeepers and the front desk employees night auditors etc for things beyond their own control Sure some employees can be awful or rude and feel free to mention them in a review or to MGMT but some of us really do care how your stay is going and are empathetic to your needs through whatever undesirable situation is unfolding And despite working here I couldnt afford to stay here for even a single night if I wanted to so yes I really do agree that the room rate is quite often "bullshit" And theres nothing more embarrassing than checking someone into a room that is listed as Vacant/Ready in system but actually dirty/occupied (youd be surprised how often this can happen) Well there is a lot more but Ill save that for another day Ohhh and if it seems like the room rate went up an extra few hundred dollars because theres a Holiday it probably did,sinkfla,16226341100,10

h0ax6e3,nq9fjc,I worked at a 4 star ski resort that was supremely mismanaged The day to day running had recently been taken over by a local company but all the guests were still managed by the original UK company so I and my fellow english employees were flown out before the season started and they hadnt finished building the new lobby yet There was no food or laundry facilities but the company kept up the salary deductions to cover food and laundry we were supposed to cover it from petty cash that my boss had Well was supposed to have but the bank wasnt open Once the season started and the guests arrived the complaints came in * the food that was there was a buffet and the options were super weird We got a tray of bacon as the meat option one time and baked tinned potatos as the side pretty often and then the vegetarian options would be like hot olives * the hotel was dirty - the pool had stuff growing in it because no one in a ski resort owns a pool cleaner So they just turned the heating off to kill the algae/moss In the snow cold-ass pool the kids hated it * the cleaners didnt clean all the rooms on changeover day One family arrived late - 8pm after a delayed flight and when they went to put their kids to bed there was a banana skin on the table left from the people who left that morning before 9am Oh and because they arrived at 8 the kitchen wouldnt let them in to get food - last entry at 8pm even though there were still people in the buffet area and still food laid out * food hygiene was really bad kitchen was gross buffet left out for hours many MANY guests got norovirus to the point that it was a frequent complaint in the reviews of the hotel I got norovirus after a kid puked on me who knows where he got it? I do The Hotel anyway * turns out they had problems with noro the year before too! so many people got sick that the company was sued and thats why the new management took over * we were supposed to clean the childcare sections every day but we didnt get given cleaning products so it was just soap and water and baby-safe detergent that smelled like ass Also we couldnt leave til it was done so it was done as fast as humanly possible before we all fucked off home This was all made worse byt he language barrier The staff all spoke french - which is fair enough We were in france The english staff did not there were a handful of us who did but no more than school level mostly The english boss in charge of the resort didnt speak french He only spoke spanish which was handy for taking to the kitchen guys because they didnt speak french either - arabic and spanish mostly This meant there was a huge disconnect between the local staff who ran the hotel and the english workers who mostly did childcare and guest services ie hearing complaints Lots of the problems came down to laziness and/or apathy Every worker there was getting paid very little to do a crappy job english AND local So it shouldnt have been surprising that they didnt take pride in it we all just wanted to ski and drink Work suffered because no one cared Anyway I left early but not as early as I should have then covid hit and everyone else lost their jobs too Including the boss who had the same almost-illegal work practices forced on him but had no one to complain to I didnt feel too bad for him on account of he fucked two of the english workers who worked under him which is literally always sus Fucking mess Put me off hotels but luckily I havent been travelling much in the last year,TuesdayRivers,16226344070,6

hjo8qxw,oe5uja,This might not be as big of a deal for some but I had this best friend I knew for years I knew him for about 5-6 years and we really built a great friendship imagine the closest friend you could have and that would be him Anyways when me and him entered great 10 a year ago he shared some bad news to me He had to move to another country because his dad found a job offer there this was at the time of corona His dad couldnt find a job I the country we were in because of COVID So I was really upset that he was leaving so soon I wanted to finish school with him but sadly he had to leave We agreed we would still call each other a lot and that him leaving wont change things The first 1-2 months of him leaving was fine we talked less but we still played games and talked and watched shows together Anyways after the second month he started changing he would always be busy even though we were on summer breakbut of course I wouldnt suspect him if anything He always had an excuse to leave or to not talk or to not play I would always be the one to text first and call first I dont recall him ever calling me first but that wasnt an issue to me I handled all of the the bad things that would happen This one time we were playing rl and he said that there is a cleaning lady who has to clean his room for 10-15mins I was fine with it he left the discord call and I waited As Im just staring on the menu waiting for him to call me back I notice that it says hes currently in a match it meant that he just dipped out in me I was so furious why didnt he just tell me that he doesnt want to play with me why does he make excuses all of the time Anyways I text him "so you just dipped out on me" his reply is what pissed me off the most he said "ngl ya man lmao" That just hit me in a different way so I blocked him and havent talked to him since,threaldigits,16362932350,3

h45myh9,oe5uja,Pretty much what other people are saying In high school I had your typical fake friends who made plans with each other right in front of me without even acknowledging my existence I was always the one to reach out and if I was lucky they would respond with excuses as to why they couldnt hang out They used me when it was convenient for them like helping them with their homework and then as soon as I did they just vanished They made fun of me a lot usually about my appearance and sometimes my nationality Which strikes me as odd because I took good care of myself back then and was in great shape so not much to make fun of I remember one time in senior year one of them got the entire class including the teacher to laugh at me for being a virgin Real funny jokes you got there Greg We graduated three years ago and I havent heard from anyone since I moved away for University and I made one friend my freshman year who I thought could turn out to be an amazing friend but nope He suddenly drops out and confesses his love for me one night over text when he was drinking (I am a guy) Said he wanted to do "things" to me and I told him off for making me feel like I had a friend and then just vanishing into thin air and ghosting me (I had tried to get a hold of him for a while afterward I was worried something happened to him) And for being a fucking creep that isnt something normal people text as far as I am aware I think he just wanted a fuck buddy and never gave a shit about me I didnt care if he was bi or whatever I just got mad because aside from him I had no one else talk to or hang out with and this particular event really made me start to distrust people It made me realize that people can be an entirely different person on the inside and you wont know their true colors until they choose reveal it or in dire situations This was in 2019 for context Havent heard or spoken to him since I am 20 now will be 21 in two weeks and not only do I have zero friends I just quit my job last month because Im just fed up Everyday I wake up depressed and angry and bitter Just seems like everyone is fake idk maybe I just have to try harder and meet more people I was able to make "friends" at my work we got along great and all but it never evolved into anything more than a work/professional/casually friendly relationship And school of course has been online for the past year and a half because of covid so theres that I know this isnt as serious or impactful as other posts on here but just wanted to share because no one else knows any of this and how I feel I think genuine friends are very important to a persons mental health at least for people like me who cant stand feeling lonely This is also of course just one persons experience so dont take what I say as fact its just my mindset right now given what I have personally seen and experienced,chris_get_the_money,16255117490,2

h472ehh,oe5uja,I wasnt invited to board game night at the beginning of the pandemic because I was the only person that relied on public transportation to get there The reasoning was that I was at the highest risk of catching Covid Because I was doing a high risk job I didnt question it Mid-pandemic my good friend moved out and things eventually died down in terms of the intensity of Covid It soon became apparent that the other people in the apartment didnt really like me because the normal events like new years birthdays etc I was never invited over My good friend would feel bad and invite me out to dinner parties with his girlfriend usually a few days after board game nights Surprisingly with all the time I had to work things out in my head this past year I was able to handle it well When I hang with my good friend I usually ask how everyone is and leave it at that Life is short I was only invited because my friend lived in the apartment Plus I already figured out the secret cheese dip recipe sohuehuehue,joik,16255392800,2
h478kl3,oe5uja,The moment that they put work above my health I had some people at my work that I was rather good friends with wed even planned a vacation together at one point for when covid restrictions were over or lightened up I had a severe back injury in January that initially left me bed ridden for a month (Thank the gods for adjustable beds) I had to have assistance when walking the 10 feet from my bed to my bathroom and had to use a cane when trying to walk alone I was hunched over and I couldnt move my right side at all without having pain that would make me scream Initially I was diagnosed as just having a pinch sciatica (no MRI at this time) When I was able to walk upright again I was sent to physical therapy and the place I chose does massage therapy Everything was going good until the therapist had me move to get up from the table I had the worst pain of my life (and I woke up twice during heart surgery!) and it left me unable to move or be moved for an hour When he managed to get me to my ride I was unable to move the right side again The car ride was horrible and I had to be sedated as soon as I got home for the pain Ended up going for an MRI for that one and was taken off from work until further notice That diagnosis was that I had a bulging disc and sciatic damage All this time I was getting messages from one person in particular asking me when Im going to come back to work because they needed me thereevery single day And I told them every day that I was on (unpaid) medical leave until further notice I was able to go back for 2 weeks in March then I had to have a 2nd MRI to see how my back was Well having to lay on a flat board like that made my pain come back and I was taken off work again until further notice I was re-diagnosed with bulging disc tear in said disc and sciatic damage Ontop of that we found that I have a type of genetic bone degradation that was affecting my lower lumbar I had to greatly reduce what I could do at work when I did return and said friend gave me a bunch of shit for it both in person and text I ended up having to quit one day because of my boss not being accommodating to my needs and the said friend messaged me asking me why I quit because that put her in a spot at work She then removed and blocked me from all social media My other work friends still talk to me but because I inconvenienced her I was the horrible person in her eyes Good riddance,GalacticMemories,16255429300,2

I am envious of people who have close friends who reach out to you every once and awhile yknow? I want to make friends with someone who wants to hang out with me who will contact me every once in a while even its just to share a funny meme or say "remember that time when" Thats the real reason I play video games and am on reddit honestly Im an extrovert that wants to talk to people and connect with someone I always worry they dont want to be friends with me and are just playing along because they feel bad if they didnt or something Ive never told anyone this but man now Im sad COVID-19 lockdowns have not been good for my self-esteem or self-confidence Ive done a lot of work on improving myself and trying to fight my mental health problems but I always worry that they are the reason people dont reach out like I wish they would,crazylighter,16254978760,1

gy4ndwv,nc8fis,Well for the last year or so Ive tried anything I can to discourage the convicted crack cocaine dealers that live in the basement apartment of my building to not harass us while high assault me deal drugs on the property or have their customers come here because theyre all crackheads and stuff has been stolen and damaged We were the family that cried wolf for most of this year literally getting no response from property management or police when my 5 year old found a dimebag of crack in front of their unit door but shit started closing in on them when I got two HD cameras for the back and front yard and made a habit out of recording every time I leave the building The star of this story has been the girlfriend who soured the neighborly relationship when she once came down the street at midnight yelling that Im a bad neighbor because I didnt bring her garbage can in two days after pickup which I admit I was reticent to do at the start of COVID given the only job either of them holds aside from "crackwhore" is the dumpster diving her boyfriend does for a living stealing from Salvation Army donation bins and the like She is a master at gaslighting so recently my property managers received a call from her about me coming outside and saying "whats that?" before starting an altercation between the two of us after months of everyone being told not to contact each other However because I know she is a fucking liar I am always recording and before I say "whats that?" she is clearly on tape making a shitty comment about my kids hence the altercation Until I showed them definitive proof that she was the one starting shit they had thought I was the asshole provoking the drug dealers to get a rise so I could push them out The reality as theyre all forced now to confront is that shes exactly what Ive described her to be: a literal crackwhore who has harassed and assaulted us for a year threatened on tape to bash my head in with a shovel call child services on my kids tried to poison my dog and *kisses fingers* beat the shit out of her boyfriend right on the front lawn in full view of my dope ass camera resulting in an assault charge and two subsequent arrests for returning to the property All of her bad days were once our burden and because I started filming them shell never be allowed back and theyre going to be evicted as soon as possible Finally,kencarlo,16210166580,3

gy4pe0i,nc8fis,I got on an airplane during the covid stuff A woman sat behind me on an airplane and kept jamming her knees into the back of my chair It was uncomfortable to feel her jabbing into my lower back/ass I asked her nicely to not and she replied with something like "I dont have enough room back here" We all had the same amount of leg room and I would never jam my knees in someones chair like that Rather than bringing the conflict about directly with that woman I called a flight attendant and asked to be moved She said not to worry about it just to remain in my seat So internally annoyed having to sit awkwardly to avoid feeling the womans knees behind me I prepared for a long uncomfortable flight The woman behind me had said something to the flight attendant that was rude She started yelling So I started recording (The woman behind me could not see my camera) Fighting about wearing a mask It felt like it was taking forever to taxi to the runway and the entire plane was emptied except for that woman Once we were off the plane cops went in and escorted that woman off She apparently was fighting wearing a mask in the airport even before all of this So we boarded the plane again and I got my knee-free ride after all But yeah this was in the leak of the anti-maskers getting kicked off planes added to no-fly lists etc And the fact that I was there for one made me want to record it (And the fact that I got some person justice was frosting on the cake),vitaestbona1,16210175260,1

Like ) with the mans name engraved on it Once he saw our frightened reaction and sight line he immediately moved away from it and calmed us down it was totally fine It was my first week canvassing and I was afraid this man had lured us into his house so he could torture and kill us And we were in LA people usually dont have guns lying around so that is weird Another take away: why is your name engraved on the gun?

gwyt6eo,n4vf1p,This is the opposite but still a similar situation I got into Magic: the Gathering around 1994 when I was 9 years old I remember asking for some high-end cards that first Christmas particularly Black Lotus and the myriad of mox and dual land cards Duals were in the ballpark of $10 $20-30 for moxen and $50ish for lotus My mom thought that I was insane asking for a $50 trading card but she did get me an assortment of dual lands and booster packs Fast forward almost 30 years and I dont really play anymore aside from some super-casual games at the kitchen table when friends visited pre-Covid times I still have all of those dual lands in decent shape Some are now worth hundreds of dollars! However Black Lotuses are valued in excess of $10000 some editions going for much much more I like to remind my mom of this every so often It definitely was NOT a phase!,skyst,16201730520,12
gwyxtj5,n4vf1p,I have two cringe phases I am now and at the time was a very pale irish boy As a kid I had a mullet a distinct lisp and ALWAYS wore a poncho Once I hit junior high i wanted to set myself apart so I ditched the poncho and started wearing superman shirts I wore them every day for 19 years I currently have a collection of over 100 with one signed by Margaret Kidder (Lois Lane from the original movies) My friends mom used to do her hair by random chance For my highschool graduation I smuggled in an 8 year olds superman costume with a light up chest I wore it up on to the stage to get my diploma For a few days before a few teachers jokingly said i should do something similar little did they know Inhad the costume at homeTo get my diploma they said i had to do 80 hours community service My pastor signed off on it and said I did the work without doing it so i could get my diploma I take partial blame for Covid i stopped wearing the shirts towards the end of 2019 I am sorry,north_man97,16201752630,2

gwziv0o,n4vf1p,I bought a guitar I spent 150 on a Squier Strat starter pack which came with an amp a DVD some picks a strap and a case I really tried to learn but i barely got anywhere I had a girlfriend at the time and I was also working full-time so when i did practice it was hardly regularly Also an electric solid body guitar is heavy and uncomfortable I bought an electric as a friend said it was easier to play but I really shouldnt bought a used acoustic guitar as it wouldve been cheaper and an acoustic is really portable Sometimes i just wanted to sit in a field and practice and an electric guitar doesnt do that is purely an indoor activity I still have my guitar I will probably never learn how to play it but its a big regret as i really felt Id play it The worst thing is for the last year Ive been out of work due to Covid and Ive not picked it up once it just hangs in my cupboard out of the way,Martipar,16201857370,1
gwzqjug,n4vf1p,TLDR: boy simps for celebrity stays in a toxic community for it works job just to afford concerts drops it in the end and becomes weeb :) I was deep in the stan twitter shit hole all of high school This was before kpop stan twitter was around so it wasnt as toxic but it was still stan twitter so it still had a lot of toxicity The thing is I didnt really fit in with most of the people on there and I was too oblivious at the time to realize that and look elsewhere That wasnt the worst of it though ohhh no My obsession with the celebrity at the head of it drove me to do things I regret I threw away most of my free time obsessing over them and stalking their twitter (it didnt help that they were very active) I worked almost full time in high school at a job that drove me to severe depression just so I could get VIP at their concerts! Why!?! Why did I do something that would affect my mental health for the rest of my life just for that 1-2 hours of "happiness?" At one point I got an xbox and sorta diverted from that but the obsession didnt fully go away Finally after 5 years it came to a head I met them at a concert with a meet and greet ticket After that I felt like I peaked I did it My biggest dream come true Now what comes next? Well I sorta idled around for awhile smoking weed to help me work through my problems Now a good friend of mine had been bringing me to this annual anime convention for 3 years I enjoyed going because they had a rave and video game related stuff there but anime never really clicked with me because of how closed minded I was up until this point That obsessive energy I used to put into a celebrity had sorta built up over the course of 6 months and it all got thrown into anime For once I felt happy This happiness lasted for awhile until 2020 and covid struck Now Im back to being depressed at a similar level that I was in high school but its not all the same I know Im a different man now and being more open minded has helped me a lot I actually talk to people online now instead of being alone tweeting out my feelings to deaf ears,OhSnapItzJD,16201903980,1
gwzu26s,n4vf1p,This one is recent: roller skating When COVID had me homebound I watched too many IGs of amazing rhythm skaters and became convinced I could just pick it up in a few weeks I made roller skating the entirety of my personality until I took a tiny spill broke my arm and had to sell every last scrap of my trendy gear to pay medical bills,MetroLab,16201928370,1
gx025n5,n4vf1p,My emo phase long air skinny jeans full dark cloths and emo song 24/7 the sad part is that Im half indian and half filipino so yeah it was awful My anime phase i bought figures light novels few mangas the hentai shirt (not the ahegao one but the hentai haven one rip) i used to go out with a anime girl pin on my back pack and I had an anime girl key chain My edgelord phase I was a full redditor I used to think with only facts and logic I was so fucking toxic and this is my most hated phase Cold sociopath wanna be My suicidal phase welp kinda self-explanatory My gym phase i used to go to the gym like 4 day a week light full body exercises focused on cardio in order to burn so far guess who is not only an immigrant but also a fatso So yeah when i started to like to have a great balance between school social life and gym the fucking covid hit Now Im recovering Im in my fucking lowest my first year in uni is a disaster my social life is a disaster im fucking destroying my body with fasting and huge amount of food in small time Maybe these arent phases but just parts of me,ciaux,16201991580,1

h7anxee,ovnbun,I have incurable cancer but Im an adult Ive been put in touch with a chartity who helps out people in my position Normally its not a "Make a wish" type of thing they just pay for a holiday or something But I have told them that if Im still here after covid and if Bill Burr does another world tour Id like to meet him they responded pretty positively saying theyd "see what they could do" haha Im not holding my breath but it would be pretty cool if it happened Edit: 1) Wow this took off thanks so much for the upvotes awards comments offers of help and offers to get me to an actual upcoming Bill Burr show I couldnt believe it 2) I am in Australia and currently cant just pop over to the USA because of COVID cancer treatment and regular life stuff This is why I said "if Bill Burr does another world tour" Hes been here before so post COVID there is a good chance hell come again 3) When I could no longer work as a Train Driver (they for some reason dont want people with brain tumours in charge of 1000 peoples lives) I had to semi retire Instead I published my own [Childrens Book](http://wwwgiraffeonyourheadcom) as a new career that I can pick up or put down easily depending on how Im going with treatment So feel free to check it out,TheCowardMcCall,16278091320,10015

h7cy8uk,ovnbun,My husband worked on something to grant a wish (Make a Wish contacted the company he worked for) and it was taking weeks and weeks to coordinate because of COVID It was film related so he had video of the child asking for their wish in an interview One day I walked into the room and my husband was sobbing That kid never got their wish and we both just lost it crying for a bit thinking about his parents and family and his sweet little face Covid took a lot from a lot of people but that just stung so hard to have seen his face and heard his wish and have everything shut down and prevent that small thing from happening before he died,kmfoh,16278543950,8
gx6gz3m,n68cj4,Going on vacation for the evidence not the experience Social media has exposed every cool place of interest and hidden gem out there which is cool in theory but it just means that everything is now more crowded than it used to be and instead of actually enjoying the experience people are just interested in snapping their shots and moving on to the next target I saw the Mona Lisa pre-covid and expected it to be a crowded messshuffling through a line for an hour to have 30 seconds to look at the paintingno surprise there But it was depressing to see most people get to the painting turn around and take a selfie and move on without another glance They only saw the painting through their phone screen,AkTxBk,16203253020,353

h0yhoc6,nuceo8,I used to run for three friends who are all very different but we got out of the habit come covid My partner used to like watching for all the weird and whacky stuff they would come up with Ones a quiet guy that works in retail those looks are decieving: - start of the session he went to a bakery for a bag of flower sure you can have one? He carries it around all session every )+place they go he makes sure to say he is still carrying this bag of flour Finaly they end up in a tunnel in a volcano that leads to a secret nightclub / cult filled with half bear people (called temple of the lava bears) the bouncer stops the party and asks for ID which they dont have He perks up stating he cuts into the bag of flour and slams it on the ground trying to make as big a cloud as he can Tells the other two to run and get down as he starts sprinting away end of his turn he somehow lit it (cant recall he wasnt a wizard maybe flaming arrow?) Then showed me an educational video on his phone of a flour mill explosion stating he gets bored at work so looked it up One of the others is an enginner by trade and you can tell he once made mustard gas in game to kill something One that really stands out is the shoe cleaning kit They had been paid to infect a politician with the stone plague as he was anti humane treatment and someone wanted to give him a taste of his own medicine So my engineer friends character sneaks in to the manor house pretending to be a servant Im looking for a shoe cleaning kit where would I look for one so he gets the kit and continues up to the bedrooms in servant disguise with these plague rocks in his pocket He gets to the master bedroom pretends to clean the lords shoes and sneaks the rocks in lords wife comes on "oh great could you do the kids shoes too they need to look perfect for tonights fundraiser" a smile spread over his face and he says "certainly maam" and dashes of to do the kids shoes (i didnt think he would go for it) he then makes sure to dust their shoes too with the stones The final friend is an accountant in training i once made the mistake of letting him get ahold of a croocked business mans paperwork He destroyed this guy by essentially marking it ip with red ink and sending it to the taxman pointing out how he was commtiting different crimes Those are the ones that come to mind for innane items I didnt expect much from,CaptainDrinksAlot,16231012150,6

h5hffak,olspwd,This happened April last year so at the height of COVID panic There are four streets that zigzag down a hill and a green belt that stretches the length of all the streets Its a good 50 yards away from the nearest house and the walking path is not well lit at night I was looking at my watch (changing the music) and this guy in a pickup truck pulls up as close to me as possible (the street is about 20 yards away) and the cabin in his truck is super dark He is like 35-40 based on his voice He honks his horn and I look up and he says "Hey! You need a ride?" I was shocked because of how bizarre the question was Also because of covid I kept thinking about how extra weird it was because everyone was trying to avoid each other Confused all I said was "No" "You sure? Its dark out and you never know" Then I turned and ran down the hill and ran to the nearest house (I happen to know this family so I rang the doorbell frantically and went inside) That scared the shit out of me,agoodmanator,16264972170,1

h8faf2v,p1f1gn,Edward Fucking Bernays I think sometimes about going back in time to kill someone; everyone says "Hitler" but Hitler was a loud anomaly that was destined to overreach and flame/be snuffed out Bernays OTOH invented the modern propaganda state using the concept of "public relations" and the global elites adopting and furthering of his research - and stretching it into virtually every arena - is why humanity is drowning in a sea of lies while the world is ostensibly ending The reason we cant address climate change? Propaganda The reason COVID isnt over and done with globally? Propaganda The reason the vast global working class cant seem to see that their political parties are bought out and working against them? Propaganda I could go on but the basic point is this: hardly anybody knows who Bernays was (a fact he was proud of and got off on) but he has **profoundly** affected your life; if you grew up after Bernays youve *never* not been propagandized and never *not* had your worldview grossly distorted by it Im sure someone else might eventually have picked up on the things that Bernays figured out and run with it but Bernays basically gave the US Govt a manual on how to get people to act against their own best interests - and those fuckers have had nearly 100 years to build on and perfect his research Anyway heres a doc on Bernays and what he did to us: [The Century of the Self Pt1: Happiness Machines](https://youtube/DnPmg0R1M04) [The Century of the Self Pt 2: The Engineering of Consent](https://youtube/fEsPOt8MG7E) [The Century of the Self Pt 3: There Is a Policeman Inside All Our Heads; He Must Be Destroyed](https://youtube/ub2LB2MaGoM) [The Century of the Self Pt 4: Eight People Sipping Wine in Kettering](https://youtube/VouaAz5mQAs),re_trace,16286116530,283

ht0izy3,s5m4up,A few years ago there were plans to build a new row of generic shops on what was the largest town-centre car park There were loads of objections based on it being out of character for our little very old town (we have several medieval buildings still in use and most of the high street is older than 1900) and the reduction of car parking availability which was already a problem for the town In the end though the project was cancelled because the land is owned by the adjacent supermarket and leased to the council for car parking and theres a covenant in place that means no for-profit structure can be built there so that puts shops out of the question Well now its been developed again Half the car park has been redeveloped with long overdue new tarmac and automatic barriers have been installed The other half is blocked off waiting for construction of an old peoples home (because our town apparently doesnt have enough of these already) But the developer got started before they got planning permission so even though the supermarket covenant doesnt apply because itd be a social care setting rather than shops they still cant do anything because the council hasnt approved it So theyre left with half a car park thats not useable because the layout has been interrupted for the contruction of the new layout of the other half of the car park Theyd have to redo that half to make it usable as a car park again but theres no point in that if they get planning permission soon so theyre losing out on the income from some 80+ car parking spaces If it werent for Covid the town would be up in arms about the lack of car parking but theres been a marked reduction in demand so its not,chilari,16424058810,7

hsz9zfe,s5m4up,One of our local hospitals just got shutdown after it was bought out a couple of years ago and was run into the ground by the new owners The biggest town in the area with 30000 people had 2 hospitals A couple of years ago one of the hospitals was bought out by a company out of Michigan It didnt take long for them to start firing a bunch of people It got to the point where many of the departments didnt have anyone running them >Investigators noted there was no chief operating officer as well as directors for the emergency department surgical services nutrition services materials management accounting informational technology imaging health information management case management or an exercise physiologist in the rehabilitation unit It had gotten to the point that they had to shut down their ICU because they had to keep pulling the ICU nurses to the emergency department to keep thing running It was noted that they had even pulled nurses out of their orientations before even verifying their credentials to work shifts in the ER The staffing problem led to an investigation by the state >According to the report on June 2 2021 a patient was unable to receive sustained CPR due to to a lack of staff That same patient eventually died Just a few weeks later in July another patient had been admitted for Covid-19 As the individual got sicker staff rolled in a crash cart only to find no resuscitation bags on the cart >CMS investigators would also discover more issues with the carts During a tour on Nov 16 2021 the report notes 8 out of 30 twice-a-day crash cart checks had not been completed Additionally 4 out of 15 daily cleanings of crash carts and defibrillators had been missed This led to them losing their accreditation that allows them to get paid by Medicare and Medicaid Since 72% of their revenue came from Medicare and Medicaid they were effectively shut down The owners have claimed that they plan to appeal and reopen the hospital but they have also fired everyone and the dumpsters are full of medical supplies and furniture To make matters worse their medical records system was a mess and it has been a nightmare for people to get their medical records transferred to other doctors and hospitals,TheFatJesus,16423826870,1

hszf2f6,s5m4up,So disclaimer this is my own story TLDR - I got sued by the city for a sign in a building I own The sign was advertising an online adult superstore Apparently the first amendment doesnt apply so I had to take it down because people were offended Whole Long Story Weve got a population of less than 3000 and are smack in the middle of the Bible belt My local government has historically done whatever they want regardless of the law to include awarding contracts without following bidding requirements One of these contracts was a service I provide When covid hit I moved my business to my house so the office building I own was sitting empty I asked myself What could I do to irritate City Hall? So I put a 3 x 5 sign up in my window advertising a fictional adult superstore Within 12 hours I was in my parking lot explaining to the mayor and four police officers why I wasnt going to take the sign down The city passed a new ordinance (also without following the required legal procedures) making the advertising of an adult business within the city limits illegal Not operating a store I understand zoning laws but simply having a sign up They cited me and I ended up going to court where the judge told me I had to take the sign down despite providing the multiple precedent cases from all levels of US government identifying the ordinance as unconstitutional I ended up taking the sign down to avoid a 25000 / day fine but it still pisses me off,jonrog,16423848940,1

He didnt respond back i was in so much shock cause I never thought jimmy would have a huge grudge against a teacher I later told the principal that our physics teacher didnt say those things and that my friend edited it the next day i didnt see jimmy so i texted him saying "wya??" he responded saying "you got me expelled you snitching son of a bitch" I know i may sound like a fake friend but that video could have really ruined my teachers life i havent talked or seen jimmy in 2 years but i hope hes doing better now,Noobwithazer0,16401871160,1
h69krgx,oq0qjx,Wetherspoons - for those unaware and outside of the UK: theyre a pub chain thats the largest in the UK and owned by a really unpleasant man named Tim Martin I boycotted them for several reasons: 1 They have a habit of buying out prominent buildings like music venues that have went under to turn them into massive shitty pubs As a musician and concert lover this is painful to see 2 At the beginning of the first COVID lockdown in the UK where every single pub was forced to shut and the furlough scheme was being rolled out Tim Martin made a statement to all of his employees basically along the lines of "I wont be covering furlough for any of you so youre free to look for other jobs in the meantime But also if you do youll be fired" Incredibly scummy 3 Tim Martin is a die-hard Brexit fan who regularly sucks up to Boris Johnson and - in the time leading up to the referendum - turned all his pubs into literal pro-Brexit propaganda stations (he still does this they have their own in-house magazine) Honestly Id argue hes partly to thank in no small part for the absolute shitshow we find ourselves in now owing to the fact he runs the largest and most popular pub chain in Britain and it all got turned into free advertising for the Leave campaign etc 4 Theyre just a really shite experience in general Theyre the pub equivalent of McDonalds If I ever went to one in the past it was only ever for convenience *Nobody* suggests going to drink at Spoons for the vibe Never stepped foot in one of those shitholes since,Stoddy_boi,16270580740,115

But they werent going to work so their pets are used to having them around 24/7 and they are not adjusting well to them going back to the office These dogs also werent socialized with other dogs or people so they are all neurotic It also means that many more people demanding appointments for their pets The industry already had a lot of issues with staff turnover and burnout and these have just been exasperated Hospitals are having to shorten their hours theres less staff and people are being turned away for same day appointments Even the emergency hospitals are turning patients away and closing at night And a lot of people are getting really nasty with hospital staff Were double or even triple booked some days because people feel bad turning away sick pets This means wait times skyrocket team members dont get a lunch break and its a joke of you think they get to leave anywhere close to their scheduled time off And to top it off a lot of hospitals are still curbside That means when its 100 degrees or thunder storming or the wind is ripping shingles off the roof out Im still outside And people always seem to have something incredibly important to say as soon as it starts down pouring Staff is underpaid for the job and the Best Buy across the street pays $5 more an hour starting than the average pay for a vet assistant or a receptionist This means theres no new people coming in because theyre sane and wont do the job for shit pay shit working conditions and a shitty work life balance Ive had so many friends from hospitals across the country leave the industry because all of the above was the final straw Theres been so many veterinary professionals that have taken their lives in the last year almost everyone knows someone in the industry that has committed suicide In short please be kind to your veterinary staff We are doing the best we can with what we have COVID has exasperated a problem that has long plagued the industry,italk2whales,16322683060,6

hdrj5cx,psin9a,PLEASE READ COVIDs long-term effects are something not a lot of people are talking about I am 19 and was 18 at the time of the events Im describing My past medical history includes a diagnosis of celiac disease which is an auto-immune disorder I am in college studying electrical engineering I had COVID last October and other than a sore throat and some fatigue nothing too bad happened Skip four months to February and I was hospitalized for 7 days During that time I had 102-103 fevers constant violent chills and vomiting almost daily (often multiple times) They tested me for everything in the books including: COVID (three times) mono (twice) flu strep Hepatitis A-C sepsis bacterial infections in my urine and stool a full comprehensive viral panel HIV and others I forget now I saw around 4-5 different doctors while in the hospital including different specialists like immunologists and none had a straight answer They decided it was best to start treating me for sepsis or a bacterial infection of the bloodstream I was scheduled for (roughly its been a bit of time) 200mg of Tylenol every four hours anti-nausea medication and an antibacterial medication intravenously This was the only way I could consistently break my high fevers because before this schedule after every 4 hours on the dot I broke out in chills and high fevers A highlight of the hospital trip was the third night after not having slept more than 3 hours at a time (the nurses came in every four hours to check my vitals including during the night) and little food and sustenance besides a constant IV drip they prescribed me for phenergen a strong anti-nausea medication It was to be taken intravenously and its supposed to knock you out However as I was already in a bit of a delirium from the conditions I was dealing with I was sent into a full psychosis complete with hallucinations and conversations with imaginary people I saw bugs on my arms and in the room and I cursed out my own mother who was trying to take my phone away and let me sleep I was still under it come the morning and it took a bit of time to get out of Come the fifth day I finally broke the fevers but the nausea and vomiting worsened They wanted me to stay longer than 7 days but my mother being a nurse practitioner decided it was best for me to see specialists closer to home I spent the rest of the semester seeing cardiologists oncologists and immunologists all with no clue what happened They ruled out cancer though thank God I even tested positive for mono somehow during that time around the end of March to which the oncologist who ordered the tests was baffled Skip to June and Im seeing an immunologist that practices near the hospital I was taken into He finds that I likely had Multi-Inflammatory Syndrome for Children (MIS-C) which is (very generally) an implosion of ones immune system This explained how heightened my symptoms were and how alarming my bloodwork was (all the immune tests were incredibly high) He shared with me a case study of another 18 year old male who was taken in with similar symptoms and treated for sepsis like I was and he died suddenly of multi-organ failure in the hospital Im lucky to have made it out alive Now in September I had a checkup visit with the immunologist and he was describing how many kids are experiencing this syndrome after COVID It takes roughly 6-8 weeks to take effect and with the new variants like the delta variant its even more shortened to 2-4 It targets mostly white male teens and the hospital was described as "overwhelmed" with these kids He described how COVID is almost changing peoples immune systems and how not only the immune system but the cardiovascular system is being terribly effected long-term This whole experience has thrown a lot into my life and Im happy to have made it out alive Its thrown quite a wrench in my college career but Im going strong My only concern is that these new variants will cause much worse effects and I have had to change a lot of my own activities in order to avoid even the chance of catching it again Im fully vaccinated and likely will get a booster in a couple months when Im able to The point to all this especially is to PLEASE get vaccinated itll save so many more lives,jimboyng,16322574430,16

Call at the FIRST sign of illness even if this means you might have to cancel the appointment later because trust me well fill it And be prepared for long ER wait times Dont sit on an issue for a couple hours and then go to the ER Get yourself in line at the ER and then think about if you need to be there or not Its a scary time for animals be on top of things! I also recommend getting set up as a client with a regular vet if you dont have one Clinics will squeeze in their own clients before non clients And finally please have some compassion for the people trying to HELP your animals If the pandemic has proven one thing its that we are indeed NOT in it for the money If we were we all would have walked out by now,Lynn4562756,16323073910,3

Theyre older theyve lived their lives and gotten to fall in love and go to college and start a family of their own and rescue animals and master their hobbies and listen to music and go to concerts and watch movies and have picnics under the stars and live And its still heartbreaking every single time we have an elderly patient die in our hospital even knowing all that But babies?

What can they do? My best advice is to travel to a different region of the US while immunocompromised during a pandemic to get some treatment Then travel back home and start chemotherapy during a pandemic This assumes they have the money / insurance / etc to travel to a different state HUGE assumption Otherwise its just watch wait hope and treat symptoms We dont have beds we dont have ventilators we dont have ICU nurses / RTs we dont have the things that let us help people People are stuck at hospitals that dont feel comfortable treating their problems (especially for trauma) A colleague called me about an intracranial hemorrhage late last night to see if I thought the patient would do okay if they went home with a responsible adult We dont have any beds to monitor them we have to limit use of what resources we have I thought it would probably be fine Hell even if the guy did get worse and had to go to the OR we dont have an ICU bed to send him to hed sit in PACU for a day or two then get discharged home nowhere close to my standard of care But thats where we are trying new things because we literally cant do what we think is best,TheDentateGyrus,16322735120,2

h7a0shs,ot0pdk,I dont exactly cater to them but my great uncle and aunt are fucking loaded They have two IDENTICAL houses in different parts of Toronto which is already a stupidly expensive area to buy a closet in and not only did they buy the houses they were *custom built* When we told them we were looking for a house to rent at the beginning of Covid they were just like here take this house and let us live in the second house for free The house especially stood out because it had been built right next to a bunch of normal sized houses It was by no means a mansion they had a limited space after all but it was much taller then the others around is and wider too Inside all the furniture was white which made my mother super paranoid and she immediately covered them so we wouldnt ruin it The kitchen table had a glass top and the floors where made of very dark wood which always showed even the slightest amount of dirt on them and we were constantly sweeping It was also filled with the strangest decor A huge neon framed image of Marilyn Monroe in the same room as bleach white couches and glass tables with futuristic metal candle holders Metal table decorations that looked like maces and one like a dick There were so many windows too The dining room had windows all along two of the walls that went from floor to ceiling My room had three floor to ceiling windows as well with no curtains overlooking a street so the first thing we did was slap curtains on that I also had a square walk in closet so that was an interesting experience my clothes didnt even take up half the closet I ended up moving to a new school and when my classmates found out where I was living they all got super excited and kept asking what was inside They had all watched it while getting built and then watch it be empty for *two fucking years* before we came along One of my great uncles kids asked us how we were enjoying the "party house" while we lived there There was multiple sets of furniture stored away too When we arrived I was showed to an area filled with different bed cover sets and told I could pick whichever one I liked There was never a piece of furniture we couldnt find None of the rooms had lamps in them so after a small expedition we found enough lamps to light the whole house with just lamps There were so many miscellaneous items in that storage space to decorate with I will never forget the wall of just decorative pillows They also have a third house in Lebanon that has so many floors they need an elevator to go around the house It has multiple living rooms and multiple formal sitting rooms There are two kitchens on different floors and more balconies then I can count One of the dining rooms that was only ever used once in our entire stay with them at the Lebanon house had these pillars surrounding the table that were really thick with flat reflective glass on the table facing ends that where filled with china and glass sculptures They also had a spiraling staircase that was used to traverse the three main floors and get up to the attic It was this stone marble-y thing that was very slippery if you had socks on and there was absolutely no railing It was just a drop off I feared falling to my doom every time I used those stairs When we went to Lebanon we also got to meet some of our cousins (I didnt bother asking how in the world we are related at some point you just accept that maybe everyone in the middle east is your relative) They also had a multiple story house and happened to have three young children One was four one fourteen and one sixteen They had two nannies and the kids had these little remote things that could call the nannies for them like a bell but digital A lot of the nights the adults where out and the kids would all be left together with the nannies at the cousins house The fourteen year old had a wall that was just a bookcase and he admitted to me he hadnt read over 3/4 of them He had so many books I was dying to own and didnt even know the plot of them He had a play room that wasnt like just a play room it was *his* playroom and it had a huge tv that he played Fifa on All three boys went to private school obviously and were surprised my siblings and I attended public school The fourteen year old was planning on going to a football summer camp that cost more then our trip there The family hosted a dinner party once where they took us out to dinner and then had a second dinner at their home They had this huge tray of sushi except Im not sure they knew exactly what sushi was because it seems they knew the gist and guessed from there It was wrapped in seaweed but the inside was like no other sushi Ive had before It was disgusting but maybe its a rich person thing Most of it was thrown away Seeing all the excess in Lebanon made me really sad honestly All if it was so pointless Anyways that kinda got off topic but yeah it always amazes me how they live and how money is never a

h6t429y,ot0pdk,I have a friend who is an executive assistant to a CEO of a publicly traded company CEO is a Harvard MBA grad Brilliant guy He met his wife while she was a sales clerk in Victorias Secret or some similar store She hasnt finished high school Apparently she has every type of home service on contract to take care of issues as they arise in their multimillion dollar home Think plumbers gardeners electricians etc Even though all these trades are set up for her to call if something happens she never calls them but calls her husbands staff at his company for assistance Their preteen children are given unlimited and unrestricted access to several iPadsiPhones etc They rack up hundreds of dollars of charges a month buying games or game features When the kids get locked out of the device or the wife wants to dispute the charges to the credit card she calls the the husbands staff to unlock it or call the credit card company The husband tried hiring the wife a personal assistant to deal with all these issues but they kept quitting Sometimes she pulls quite an attitude with people A few people in Head office have said if they are asked to do something outside of their job responsibilities or are spoken to rudely by the CEOs wife again theyll quit The wife was told to tone it down a bit During the very restricted lockdowns the family was still vacationing around the globe travelling by private plane When landing in a European country they were going through the countrys screening process When being told about restrictions on what they could do at their destination by Airport officials etc they would call their staff at head office and ask them to find a way around Covid travel requirements or restrictions They are incredibly capable at their business its very successful but somehow incapable of dealing with basic personal responsibilities Either how to deal with issues or they think the rules dont apply to them,cerebral__flatulence,16274607930,4

h6v98ja,ot0pdk,So I did a sting working for a company that provides ultra-luxury holidays places like the Maldives When COVID hit and travel restrictions started I thought the business would be hit hard with cancellations Turns out that while pretty much every customer did cancel their holiday most of them then tried to book out entire islands and resorts for themselves and their families in the hope of riding it out in paradise The business had its best year ever! I typically work in financial services though and the products I work on are usually for the super rich or institutional investors (think pension funds) I think people would be surprised at how important ethical investing is for these people/organisations Im currently working in the ESG space where we rate securities and issuers on their Ethics Social and Governance performance Clients cant get enough of it Fund managers are all over us for more and more analysis and they hate to see a low performing issuer/security in their portfolios Right now ESG data is self reported and theres a lot of bullshit in the data but the analysts arent shy about doing their own research and correcting the record From the outside looking in the financial services industry looks like a run away freight train filled with psychopaths and theres a certainty a lot of bad actors out their throwing their weight around But in my experience most people working in system are good people who want to do good things with their investments/investment strategies Im not saying any of that justifies the inequality were seeing in the world Im saying that there are allies amongst the rich and powerful,urfavouriteredditor,16275009230,2

Except the train doesnt go below the historic district When opening; The building would sometimes sound like many people were in it; even when we knew it was only a few of us there (Place is Huge and lots of stairwells dumbwaiters; so I guess its a trick of accoustics?)

h9hb7tr,p6qb47,Ive actually never typed this all out great opportunity I think My father passed away in 2018 after a 2 year battle with ALS Maybe battle is the wrong word - ALS always wins I was travelling back and forth from Tennessee (my house) to Florida at least twice a month Sometimes I flew sometimes I drove but I was always there as often as possible Towards the end I had been down in Florida for 7 days because we knew the end was close I decided Id haul ass back to TN feed my cats and make sure they were ok and zip right back down I had flown down but it was 11 hours or so to drive it - so I found a redeye home but had to drive back to minimize away time I was up at 5am to drive back not a ton of sleep but 3 to 4 hours was normal for me and sitting on my back porch caffeinating and smoking a cigarette and letting the cats wander the yard (yea they had a rough time too I do feel bad but theyre both OK and got covid to make up for it) I saw my cat look off to my right and I glance over and see a pretty large Northern Harrier sitting on the fence I dont think theyre hawks but theyre a raptor of some sort This dude was staring right at me I worked in a pet store I know how to tell when a bird is looking at me and he was So of course I bring the cat inside and shut the door which made him kinda flutter but I sat back down and we just looked at each other for 15 minutes while I drank 2 cups of coffee (he stayed while I refilled) and chainsmoked And I knew a few minutes in that my dad had died I cant explain how - but those of you who know know exactly what I mean That 11 hour drive took about 20 I kept stopped at rest stops to nap and I knew there was no urgency I got to FL and my mother immediately took me aside to tell me - and I said I knew We werent religious but I got my dad a Valknut pendant when he got sick - I said if he gets to choose then lets meet in Valhalla Cheesy but a lot of things were back then I googled "Norse hawk" to try to find a cool image to get tattooed and the first site I clicked on said that the Valkyrie would appear as hawks to mortals as they came to retrieve the souls of the dead to take them to Valhalla - to not be shot with arrows They are also messengers I went back home a few days later after the funeral and I found a huge feather on the ground from the bird (obviously its in my safe with my birth certificate) Ive had dozens of weird raptor encounters including a red shouldered hawk literally plucking a flight feather and tossing it to me (on camera) I have no idea what it all means but I know it means something,rstyAR,16293370800,2
h9hulcd,p6qb47,I was at Zojoji temple in Tokyo after a farewell dinner with some friends and I knew that my aunt was in the ICU with covid I sat and reflected for a while when I felt an overwhelming urge to go to the shrine part and pray Im not a religious person but I did it anyway While I was standing there the incense burner (which was already extinguished for the day) suddenly erupted into a giant flame and nearly surrounded me I felt the heat and saw the light so I opened my eyes and watched it for about ten seconds before it started to die down There were several Japanese couples nearby who were looking at it and saying things like "wow thats amazing" Ive seen incense burners erupt small flames before but this was something on another level I took it to be some kind of spiritual blessing or message that my aunt was going to be okay I sent several members of my family a message telling them about my experience and saw that one person was already typing in the group chat They sent their message right after mine Apparently my aunt had passed away at 9:10 PM (tokyo time) which is the exact time that the fire happened,WovenTripp,16293471840,2

We had our "yay weekend"-beer on Friday And no-one even dared to touch them One young teacher took a tiny bit some time before and warned us I am a good eater and lost most of my taste due to COVID and tasted mostly cat food for the last six months So I thought I was on the safer side of things I was not Whoever placed it in the teachers lounge was and probably is still holding a grudge against the educational system and every teacher on this planet,DunklerErpel,16231495850,1

gz9vmp9,njrvgm,I was dating a woman for three months We are both lawyers so given our schedules dating at that point usually consisted of staying at one anothers place during the week and going out for dinner and drinks on the weekends One day she tells me that there was a complaint that she was drunk in court and that there will be a hearing to determine if she can continue being assigned indigent clients by the state For a solo practitioner this was a huge part of her practice I get a call from a doctor who asks if Ive ever noticed alcohol being a problem for her I said I had not Perhaps wed close down a bar on a Friday night but nothing problematic Later that day she calls me and asks to attend the hearing I get there and it has nothing to do with retaining clients It is a civil commitment hearing Apparently there were multiple complaints by both other attorneys in the courthouse and her clients Now clients often complain that an attorney isnt spending enough time in their case But when clients who are not paying for your services because the state is picking up the tab complain that is a red flag A judge that she argues in front of regularly hears reads the formal complaints and sends her to the state hospital for up to six months with a re-hearing in a month She gets sent away immediately to the state hospital and asks me to look after her cats as she suddenly wont be home for months At first I feel badly for her thinking the court must have gotten something wrong I drive the hour to the state hospital a few times a week to visit her during no-touch visits supervised by a nurse Because Im a lawyer the nurse had to stay outside a glass room By the time she gets let out three weeks later because Covid had hit in the interim I had realized that all those times that we went out a little bit too late it was because she wanted to continue drinking I also realized that whenever she got lunch between court hearings she was really getting vodka sodas I pick her up the day she gets let out On our drive back I make a comment about being nominated for the"Ex-Boyfriend of the Year" Award She looks at me and says "so youre breaking up with me?"

gzd1u17,njrvgm,Well i hope this isnt just for dating relationships because this one is about me and my father (i am a non-binary person that was born female still havent come out yet) My father has always been a control freak and wanted things done his way and never gave me any privacy and freedom he wont even let me dye my hair because "i worked so hard to get it this long and dying it will ruin it" (i was practically bald until the age of 7) and he didnt even do anything to make it grow as long as it is now that was all me He also has parental controls on my phone so he can see anything and everything i do for example one time i was texting one of my now ex boyfriends and he sent me a picture of his new haircut and because he just got it done his shirt was off so he didnt get hair all over it and i told him it looked nice A few minutes later my father texts me "why did your boyfriend send you a picture of him with his shirt off?" and so i now know he can see the text messages that i send so i had to passive aggressively tell him that he wasnt sending me a picture of him shirtless but of his new haircut and he still didnt believe me He also yelled at me and my siblings a lot while we were growing up (him and my mom broke up when i was three so he was the one who raised us basically) so now i have really bad panic attacks when people yell at me or even raise their voices at me So good job dad! and the reason i brought up my pronouns is because my dad would also call gay men and women f@ggots and Trans people Tr@nnies so i am actually scared to tall him about my sexuality and gender identity but my girlfriend is awesome and is helping me through it ANOTHER THING he also can control how long im on my phone for where my phone turns off when its 10:00pm and the only thing i can see is my lock screen and i can only get into my phone if i have my dads email and password which i dont have that info he also wont let me get the Covid-19 vaccine because he things ill grow another arm or something and so now i have been ignoring him and his texts for 3 months now Life is great!,Im_Dying_Inside666,16219221770,4

One time after pestering me for sex all night I agreed around midnight with the condition that it not be hours Well we have sex for about 2 hrs and then go for round two which is another 2hours at which point I say im tired and want to stop He says hes about to finish so we continue 30 mins I say again Im tired and want to stop He tells me again hes *about* to finish 30 min later I stop him He yells at me "WELL AT LEAST ONE OF US GOT TO FINISH" and huffs n puffs I went the fuck home Edit** one time he was playing videogames and I had my laptop with me So instead of going home I decided id go to the other room and get some writing in He opened his bedroom door put his game full volume and started yelling at the tv LOL He wasnt doing this until ai left the room After a bit of trying to concentrate I ultimately decided I would go home He texted me when I got home and was upset I didnt clean his place while he was gameing I replied to this by saying "let me know anyday you want to get some cleaning done and Ill be happy to come help you! ) He got SO mad that I wouldnt clean it for him while he gamed? Because i stayed over all the time (he HATED when Id go home) he felt I owed it to him I told him if i made a mess or saw a mess i would clean it But i pay rent at my *own* place and if im going to be cleaning anywhere it will be there (I worked full time and he didnt work) I hate to say I got back with him for more narcissistic abuse It was a year of being in a fog of confusion I was constantly over explaining myself and walking on eggshells Covid was an escape I was able to use it as an excuse to distance myself while I got my head around the idea that I was being manipulated Once the fog started to clear I cut that the fuck off and didnt look back I cannot believe the things I just went with He made it so I was confused if anything was really even happening to me I didnt trust myself He spoiled me and was so different when we started Crazy that even when you know how abuse can start you dont realize its happening to you until its happening to you,nnyyleissa,16218874200,2

gz9qnyk,njrvgm,I asked him to stop bringing friends over during a pandemic especially the "friends" he met off the street and didnt know that he decided it was okay to bring into the house to sleep over His friends were having parties during COVID all the time and I didnt want them over I was even more bothered by the fact that my boyfriend would strike up a conversation with someone on the street and invite him to sleep on my couch My boyfriend didnt understand that just because he met someone downtown doesnt mean he KNOWS them - so why would you bring him to the house? How do you know this person isnt going to rob us reach for a knife? How do you know hes not going to find your gun collection? So I had a conversation with him about it told him how I felt and he agreed to stop doing it that night he did it again Met someone off the street and let him sleep in my house I wake up to see him doing shots with someone neither of us know after I came out of my bedroom and confronted him about it he still let him sleep over We both paid the same rent shared the same responsibilities but it wasnt the first time I had to abide by his rules and he refused to abide by any of mine I actually moved out that night in front of both of them It was the night of June 30th and I told him I wasnt paying rent tomorrow I meant it I didnt pay rent and the landlord didnt hold me to it Edit - just came here to add that last week we met up as friends to put it all behind us and have lunch at some mexican place At 12pm he couldnt stop himself from having 6 margaritas Another reminder of why we broke up,spaghatta111,16218628010,3

hhiao2e,qcqv9v,I wanted to start a business with some friends It was 2018 and escape rooms were the new trend so living near an university we expected to have a lot of customers We found a place that seemed nice and we were ready to sign it was near a bus stop rent was high but affordable At first we found a small bureaucratic irregularity the real estate map wasnt up to date and the old tenant left drywall walls The agency told us that we could remove the walls or use part of them I put my foot down and refused asking them to give us what real estate map said The owner sent his construction workers to check our complaint We hired a construction worker too and he found out the false ceiling was damaged and poorly repaired and the ceiling was damaged too According to the owner the work costed 400 that they could discount from our second or third month of rent he wanted us to sign a paper to commit to repair the place at our own expenses I refused my friends werent that sure Our worker said it costed 20000 and maybe 3 months to remove the false ceiling repair the ceiling and put a new false ceiling After some blackmail from real estate agency (whose owner was the cousin of one of the involved friends) we finally refused to rent it We couldnt find another place the idea slowly faded friendship ended for unrelated reasons i couldnt find new business partners and then covid hit Being on the hook for the rent of an unusable place and legally committed to pay whatever expense was necessary with people who showed themselves unable to keep their word and finally forcefully closed because of lockdown would have been unbearable,Liscetta,16348338270,119

Anyway one night Im leaving the amazon facility and decide to skip chit chat with a coworker because Im exhausted and I really wanted to go home I get to my car pull up to the stop sign make that left turn and get hit by some kid who was speeding in his moms Nissan Altima It was a dark warehouse road with no street lights and they were going well above 90mph Their car flipped over the divider mine spun out like 5 times hitting theirs again while I was spinning All I remember is seeing the car go dark and gripping the wheel When I came to I had to crawl out the passenger seat before I realized something was wrong with my knee and my shoulder I get taken to the hospital get told I need surgery etc etc etc My girlfriends visits me and keeps me company I cried a lot when no one was around thinking about what I was going to do I eventually get sent home in a wheel chair The first night Im home my girlfriend comes to visit and says she wants to take me for a walk (lol) She pushes my wheelchair to a bench a block from my house and tell me she needs to know if were going traveling in the next 6 months or not because for her its mandatory Its a need for her Its something weve talked about before my accident but its never been posed before as an ultimatum like this At first Im taken aback trying to collect myself then I pretty much told her to look at the situation Im in Yeah Id fucking love to go traveling but it isnt in the cards right now for me If she needs that she can find someone who can do that She shuts right up When she wheels me back my house I tell her if she really wants that we can help her find a better paying job (I had two jobs paying me 15 dollars an hour she can find one too) That never happened All she did was sit around and tell me that she doesnt feel like a priority and bring up traveling Fast forward three months and Im walking again barely I only work at whole foods now One day she calls me to celebrate her completing therapy and we go get drinks and she tries to bring up traveling again I just tell her how I feel overwhelmed with everything (my own debts and bills and then hospital bills) and this ends in an argument in her car with me telling her that it eats away at my self worth and makes me feel like shit She apologized got the water works and we end the night She calls me before bed and brings it up traveling again this time begging I broke up with her the next day Two weeks later my dad finds a lawyer who can look at the accident case and finds a way to finesse the insurance and ends ups handing me a check that erases all my debt three times over This was right before covid started so I get to stay home and properly rest emotionally and physically Picked up Rollerblading and started studying again Every now and then I wonder how much money I would have wasted on that girl if I hadnt broken up with her I like to assume Im over that relationship but it still riles me up That girl was an absolute heat seeking nuke TL;DR - Getting hit by a car was the best thing that happened for my relationship and my finances,EezyBake,16348307090,486

Went to the mall that same week to walk around and see if it would help it didnt only made me feel worse On the drive home from the mall I got sudden chest pain but my wife at the time (shes my ex-wife now for many reasons) convinced me that I was fine even though I wanted to go to the ER because I thought something was wrong Followed up with my normal doctor the following week and was told I was fine again The same day as this I got MASSIVE and sudden pain in my leg that disapated just as quick as it came on after I took a few steps At this same time I got MASSIVE sudden chest pain Like shit wasnt right type pain I said fuck this Im going to the heart specialty hospital When I arrived I told the tending that was standing at the door like I feel Im going to pass out and get me a wheelchair I sat down and the next thing I know Im waking up in a bed with about 10 people around me ripping my clothes off and everything was in deafened slow motion like in a COD game when you get hit with a flash bang Doc was trying to figure shit out and I just blurted out "I think I have massive blood clot that caused a heart attack and turned into a huge pulmonary embolism" Luckily for me the doctor listened ran the test and sure as shit I was right I got started on some strong blood thinners and clot busting medicine and spent 3 weeks in ICU and now have a stent place in my Iliac vien I was only 30 when this happened I now have diminished lung function and a piece of metal in me for life plus life time blood thinners and a slightly damaged heart valve all because 5 other POS doctors had their heads stuck too far up their own ass and missed the most basic diagnosis of a PE which is racing heart and feeling winded when walking very short distances I almost died that day and because I was reading up on what my issue could be my lovely ADHD brain blurted out the thing that made me dodge the taticle nuke of death The so called reason everyone kept passing over it being a DVT or PE was because my O2 stats where above 95% the entire time even after the huge 85cm saddle PE hit I used to be in the military and was very fit until a back injury and PTSD took me out of the game so maybe thats why my body was "hiding" that I still blame the doctors for being shitty doctors though,ImAPencil123,16348795210,3

hhiqbuu,qcqv9v,Managing to not get COVID like so many other random millions of people in early March 2020 going about our daily lives right before lockdown since most didnt know a deadly pandemic was unfolding around the world Millions of others werent so lucky Personally the Catalonian Independence protests/ riots in Barcelona in Oct 2019 when I was vactioning there There was a succesion of things dodged during this event My last night of the trip I went to get gelato at a shop Downtown (de Exemplo) I noticed lots of people marching in the streets going to a protest in a square as I was walking back to my hotel I didnt think much about it since protesting is common in the EU especially around late 2019 right before Brexit Back at the hotel other guests coming back said there was a riot going on and others were making plans at the front desk to cut their stay short or leave with luggage in hand The area I had been walking through about an hour was now filled with police and rioters fighting eachother molotav cocktails being thrown cars and trash set on fire As the night progressed I could hear the chaos from my hotel room with the windows closed Made it to the airport the next morning National guards(?) were randomly checking peoples ID/ passports at the gate and pulling them into interogation rooms since some rioters were supposedly leaving the country and the night before the airport was shutdown by a large group of them Many missed their flights due to this I made it onto my flight shaken up by what was going on worrying if the country would destablize and just wanting to takeoff asap Caught one of the last flights out since shortly after we took off yet another group somehow made it on the tarmac with intentions to disrupt transportation and shut the airport down again Which I later learned after landing back in NYC Never experienced anything like that as an American (before Jan 6th anyway) and it made me not want to visit Barcelona again,ehanson,16348400790,2

hhizbfj,qcqv9v,In 2017 I met a woman as I was getting ready to take a year long work abroad opportunity in Europe The trip plans were already in motion but I hadnt dated anyone in a while we got along extraordinarily well and I figured sometimes you have to take chances So I explained everything to her and let her decide if it was worth it She said yes and we started dating about a year later Everything *seemed* great until I left and she completely changed tunes She went from warm sweet caring and supportive to manipulative evasive erratic and mean She demanded that I come home then and there everything was my fault and I needed to fix things Wed known each other for a while at this point were very close and I had never seen this from her before Hell we had *planned extensively* so that my trip would be a healthy separation for both of us So instead of thinking "This is bad just bail" (Which wouldve been better) I tried to fix things After throwing her weight around for several weeks and me trying to stand my ground be understanding and figure out what the hell was going on she dumped me Not long after I was contacted by mutual friends Ours wasnt the only bridge she had burned She had done something similar to several of our friends Then they showed me a Facebook post where she admitted to having 5-6 untreated mental disorders which she had learned to hide throughout her life Several of these disorders are known to cause people to behave manipulatively when they feel insecure and she fit the same profile Not long after COVID hit I was "lucky"; when the worst of her harassment and bullying started I was thousands of miles away and she couldnt get to me,Icy-Marketing6789,16348437240,2

hhk8e8u,qcqv9v,Going back to school A few months before Covid my friend group got into a big fight The group consisted of a lot of people who were popular in my school so everyone was sort of friends of friends there I just happened to keep talking with the same friends I knew from primary/elementary so I was with them a lot but I wasnt a social person so it was being around so many people I didnt know was awkward for me My friends arguments got increasingly bad and a fight was about to go down This was over text so it wasnt immediate but I stepped in and started talking about how the conflict was pointless and how one of our friends was being a fake one in every aspect This provoked him and so he and I got into a fight that happened shortly after He said it would be one on one and a few of my friends said theyd come to help just in case They didnt and the friend I was about to fight brought a couple other people I let him throw the first punch and then just got him on his knees with a headlock I didnt want to hurt him because I was bigger and he was sort of my buddy at the time Then one of the people he brought in repeatedly elbowed me in the back of the head before I could do anything I got a nasty concussion I backed off and then they threatened to just make it 3 on 1 so I had to leave after all the guy who elbowed me was twice my size After that we tried to talk things out but it didnt work and the rest of my friend group just laughed at me about it mocking me for putting him in a headlock instead of just throwing fists This is where I started to break off from my friend group The concussion was seriously impairing me and I couldnt do much besides rest at home and in the meanwhile the friend I fought started talking all about the fight at school and people in my friend group got upset at me for fighting him Im not sure how the whole social gimmick worked so I cant really explain their reactions but tldr they were all upset and some even threatened me This was all in November 2019- now fast forward to January 2020 Im only talking with a select few people from my friend group now but theyve been progressively treating me worse I think they shared feelings with my now-ex friends so they just started to show it more and more overtime My concussion was starting to wear off and I was slowly starting to go to school more and more At this point though I had almost no friends and a LOT of anxiety every time I went to school People were constantly questioning and occasionally throwing threats or rude comments at me despite school staff intervention Then in March Covid started and I didnt have to go to school I havent had to since and Ive been doing great in online school Since the concussion and losing my friend group Ive moved on and met a lot of new people and grown in many ways I still have a crippling anxiety when Im remotely near the school but if I was forced to go back in person my life would have been certainly worse I tried reconnecting with my old friends twice over the pandemic and they havent changed at all so things didnt work out In the end that just goes to show that going back would have only made things much worse I would elaborate on how it helped me out but thatd include sharing a lot more personal information that is outside of my comfort zone Anyway thanks if you read this,AntonioDokkanBattle,16348634780,2

But to think if he went into cardiac arrest minutes earlier he would have probably crashed and died while possibly killing someone else in the process Prob the best place to go into cardiac arrest the hospital He lived a long healthy life after this but sadly passed this year due to covid We had to put him in a nursing home because we couldnt take care of him like they could like lifting and bathing BUT we were very worried because nursing homes are breeding grounds for covid(and he hadnt gotten his shot yet) well we were right(and also the nursing home neglecting to give him his life sustaining water pill which we are looking into) In the end he didnt suffer and got to finally see his wife again Who knows maybe if they properly medicated him as the doctor ordered he might not have passed Maybe if we tried to get him vaccinated sooner his shot was scheduled a month out Tons of what ifs but its not good to dwell on Dodged one nuke but got hit by another Love ya pap,ZestyGoddess,16354248950,2

I laughed because I thought "this guys the head of nursing at a university Surely hes joking" He then told me to "shut the hell up" and went on this 20 minute rant about masks the government and how his wife left him I dont mind people having personal beliefs You cant believe in whatever you want but as long as your a good person your good in my book however; this guy just came across rude and demeaning It totally turned me off from the university I ended up going into the admissions office and filed a formal complaint against the teacher I left and now attend a WAY better university If I didnt swing by that building I wouldve been in a WAY different scenario,Drinking-Ducks,16348403950,1

hsj8k7t,s34d9b,An exploding offer - especially when that offer needs to be accepted immediately I lost my job during covid so interviewed anywhere that would take me One place offered me a job over voicemail at just before 8am and told me that if I dont accept within the hour theyll offer it to "the next one on the list" I received the message on time but decided not to call back,EnderMB,16421059230,2
hsjg0ny,s34d9b,May be an unpopular opinion but any company that refers to themselves as a "family" is a huge red flag for me I do not want to do team building exercises I do not want to spend my weekends on a company retreat I do not want to be friends nor family with my coworkers most of the time I want my work relationships to be professional and mature because we have a job to do and things to accomplish Its also been my experience that the companies that go big into the "family" dynamic of their culture are also the first ones to reprimand you for taking time to actually be with your family My last job was a small business that fired a female employee for missing too much time after her elderly parents with previous health concerns also caught Covid-19,_Blackstar,16421088190,2
hsjghyg,s34d9b,A place I interviewed at in the US told me they "work hard play weird" and that they dont let people look at personal email or their phones during the work day (pre-COVID) Thats a nope from me thanks Another was a PR firm in Sydney where they trash talked the person I was replacing and when I started that person was still there Oof And they were good at their jobs its just the women who trash talked her were obviously jealous of her because she was a lot younger and was a model in her spare time,bostonaussie1,16421090010,2

hsjsnnj,s34d9b,Dodging questions about covid protocols I learned that a good gage of how a company cares for thier employees based on what thier covid protocols were over the last 2 years and are now If they try to not discuss during the interview get defensive or outright refuse to answer they do not care about employee safety,CillRed,16421135660,2
hsjt81c,s34d9b,Making a disparaging remark about any political party or people group while chatting with others but making sure to cover themselves in official announcements by stating that they are very accepting of all peoples and beliefs Instead of raising pay for new employees they lower the initial pay and break the difference up into 2-4 "raises" in a year in order to make it look like you will be getting regular raises and promotions if you work there I saw this in action at a former employer they were true scum of the earth If the HR rep has had no Hr training or is the HR Rep/ marketing Director/ Sales Director/ Accounting Supervisor etc Ive seen this too Refusing to set concrete achievable goals in performance reviews and instead opting for unmeasurable metrics like "better team player more efficiency etc " if there is no measurement given defined and if you arent given your current and goal score they WILL give you the grade that they want to based on emotions and how much they like you If the company is making record profits and bringing on new customers and says "we are sorry but we cant do bonuses/ raises/ etc this year because of Covid" They are lying they have coffers full and just dont want to let any money go Employers have gotten greedier with the pandemic nothing has really gotten better they only want money,sam_the_guy_with_bpd,16421137830,2
hsk8c7a,s34d9b,Vague heirarchy and someone "in charge" without the job title that entails Spent three years at a place where the buck stopped with no one I was supervising inexperienced and untrained idiots given assignments by an "optimistic" "manager" while doing a job that on paper is three tiers up from my qualifications and experience as best I could without any effective support structure Lead me to be so unhappy and stressed it was simpler to literally live in my work vehicle/AirBnbs/campgrounds while making upwards of 70k a year Half my interactions being with dipshit Qanon folks once covid hit finally broke me and in the last 16 months I went on emergency medical leave effectively catatonic came back for four months before being forced out and harassed for trying to file complaints and moved into my folks entirely fucking broken mentally 8 months ago Just now picking up the pieces and starting to figure out whats next,Gullible-Day5604,16421198570,2
hsk960w,s34d9b,Two of my bosses came to work knowing they had covid and didnt care,macsauce098,16421202040,2
hskzmey,s34d9b,TL;DR: former employer didnt care that my brother passed and still made me go to work as normal I used to work at what most people refer to as "homophobic chicken" The management of the location was perceived to be very kind in the beginning They made sure I knew what I was doing and made me feel welcome in my first few weeks They claimed to have flexible scheduling but as time progressed that proved to be false When my brother passed unexpectedly in a car accident while I was at work I asked my manager if I could take bereavement Instead of giving me time off he refuses and ultimately decided to send me home for the afternoon I was expected to come back to work like normal afterwards Along with that I rarely ever got days off If we wanted time off we had to find someone to cover our shifts No exceptions Unless we had COVID-19 getting days off was no easy feat After seeing how they treated that situation I quit shortly after Im in high school still Making money is fairly important but I didnt want to miss out on important experiences I also didnt like the fact that I worked way more hours than a 16 year old was supposed to I had two jobs at that time (needed the extra money) but I quit my food service job back in November I still have my other job to this day If they expect more high school applicants they should learn to be more understanding :),i-cantwithyou,16421317480,2
hsld0nn,s34d9b,My job made everyone who wanted to get tested/vaccinated/ or even had covid symptoms or TESTED POSITIVE for covid use their PTO if they couldnt work We had no "sick days" or any supplemental paid sick leave (in CA) And those who did In fact catch covid were asked to work while positive if they were feeling "fine" It was a TX based company that branched into CA for over a year (without a contractor or business license which I assume is illegal too) just working there felt illegal in all,clashroyale2k21,16421384940,2
hslhlo0,s34d9b,> If they ask you to bring your own laptop; > if they dont have insurance policy for employees even during this Covid; > if they dont pay salary on 1st and dont have a fixed day to pay salary - ask current employees of theirs; > if the boss acts as if he is doing charity on you by paying you salary; > if they make exit of other employees difficult then your life will be tough one day for sure; > if the only way to go on top is by massaging bosses ego!; Never think that "oh it happened with them but my case is different" no exceptions Youll get screwed too; Run in opposite direction!,tellnow,16421411740,2
hsmr8tn,s34d9b,Today I got fired from Amazon because they told me not to come back without a negative Covid test but the testing facility took too long to get my results,Dannyxd,16421705600,2

hskdhgj,s34d9b,Oft; I love this post Quick backstory Until I left the industry 6 months ago I was a complaints specialist (helping companies set up complaints functions etc etc) Its a bit of a running joke that if a company needed me the entire process was likely to be a shit-show (and then once I was in there id often end up working with recruitment as most companies with complaint issues had staffing issues) &#x200B; Here is my top tips for checking if a company will be a shit show before you get in! &#x200B; 1 Phone their customer service line and ask to be transferred to recruitment (or make a general sales/query call) ; I say this with all the respect in the world having started my career on the dialer but being able to handle a call well is simply a matter of effective and consistent coaching if you get crappy service its a major red flag 2 Can you contact a named person handling your recruitment case through email / phone? if your given just a generic email box (providing they dont have a decent ATS/CRM that is picking up your emails and queuing them to your advisor) Id run for the hills 3 If you get directed instantly to a website without the person your speaking to (even a general sales bunny) offering to talk you through the company id run for the hills 4 and as so many have mentioned time to think / discuss post an offer being made; my jump to a new industry was a bit hell-ish mid covid the company I ended up joining was a 6 month process due to a hiring freeze at the time however throughout I was kept in the loop by a named individual and when it came time for an offer I had already done the math and knew the number id need to make it work the guy was so surprised that I accepted within the hour he said he would let me sleep on it and phone me in the morning Im now8 months? in and its the most supportive environment,SnooOpinions9938,16421220370,1
hsiy6yr,s34d9b,The new one is sitting on an interview with some seriously sick asshole who sits sideways to the camera because no face-to-face during COVID Im happy for that but (10) 30 min conversations? One thing really stood out: She said "Lets s not talk about your background" while all the while you can clearly see she was trying to read it I asked her how long she had been there and its 1 month Its so simple to ask the second question "How do they treat you" You then get a rant about how everyone is now second family and how they now are "Truly Loved" This is a job and never to be confused with family nobody in their right mind is seeking LOVE on a job Makes you want to vomit that you are interviewing with a failed manager on a second or third leg When they turn your back on you on interview they recognize you can probably end their career and have some fear and you are just wasting their time Btw: Do what I did Get CEOs email and send a email with discussion and opinion Just helps to speed up the process a bit Last note because of remote interviews I could literally see that her house was trash nobody in her position should be there Christ you could put a spaceship background up I know I slipped a bullet as it would have been just me trying to eliminate her bullshit after a while,ovad67,16421020830,1
