h7bgqj0,ovpxdj,Uh yeah School starts in 2 weeks and I have no choice but to send my asthmatic kid with scarred lungs from dozens of bouts of bronchitis and pneumonia back into the classroom Because Texas isnt allowing virtual learning and our governor signed an executive order to stop schools from requiring masks So I have no choice but to put him back in a classroom of 25 kids breathing all over each other ( and never washing their hands lets be real) hope his vaccine and his mask are enough because nobody else here is going to have their kids wear them voluntarily So you could use "angry" as an appropriate descriptor You could also say terrified Edit: For all those saying either homeschool or move: I am in the process of rearranging my life (work my own education which can and will obviously be put on hold because it comes way behind my kids wellbeing household expenses etc) to accommodate homeschooling but its not an overnight process Im trying He is too young to stay at home while I go to work every day But I have to work to live and I have to have health insurance to cover my sons meds theyre very expensive As for moving do you have any idea how much that costs? I have picked up and moved out of state before thats how I got here Im not native to Texas It costs thousands of dollars Have you seen the rental/real estate market lately? Its insane If I and my spouse leave our jobs to relocate it would be nearly impossible to find the same income and our rent would increase by as much as double People dont always have the privilege of just picking up and moving somewhere else That costs money and lots of it even to just move to another city and not everyone has that kind of money at their disposal,AncestralFoil247,16278291300,2817

This is all your fault!!" It may be their fault that we cant return to normal and that needless deaths continue on as a result but screaming headlines like that in their face does not communicate the message we think it does Like I said believe what you want about unvaccinated people but no matter how "unreasonable" you think they are they too have their reasons Maybe theyre a minority hesitant about the USs terrible track record with testing vaccines on them maybe theyre overwhelmed with figuring out how to get vaccinated and just dont know yet that its readily available at Walmart via walk-in appointments or maybe theyre stuck in an echo chamber of bullshit because vaccinated people push them to the edge of the circle by asserting themselves as some cult of "superior vaccine believers" Yes I know that sounds ridiculous because "vaccine-believing" is just science but read the headline out loud and pretend for a second that you have a legitimate argument against getting the vaccine - this headline is frustrating for these people and it pushes them even further away I agree that there are people who are absolute whackos that cant be reasoned with But thats a minority of the people holding off getting vaccinated Theres still so many more Americans that can be reasoned with if we just speak to them as equals respect their opinions on why theyre hesitating and let them come to the conclusion on their own terms that getting vaccinated is safe effective and the best shot (no pun intended) at returning the world back to normal,ilikecrabs,16278323790,2

h7cho06,ovpxdj,According to the research being done especially in places like Israel that has a population over 60 at 80% vaccinated by February data is showing the vaccine effectiveness is fading quick and dramatically Had you been vaccinated in January such as myself youll find youre at best walking around with an effectiveness of nearly 20% compared to someone vaccinated in June who is around 80% If unvaccinated people are the only ones getting sick the concern we are seeing wouldnt be there You would be protected with your vaccination and would have little to worry about The truth is we will see more variants and until we have boosters available and ones that can be made quickly before the new variants take hold we will continue to see spikes regardless of previous vaccinations Instead we are seeing vaccinated people spreading the virus and some knowingly I know first hand someone who is currently infected after being vaccinated in april and she continues to work at her job since the symptoms arent bad according to her and she is vaccinated The anti vaxxers are a problem but theyre a distraction from the real issue that your vaccine will only provide so much protection and its not a ticket to do whatever you want If the vaccine worked effectively for the current delta variant they would only be their own problem Kind of like driving a car with a seatbelt The direct impact is only to the individual I have and still continue to wear two masks including an n95 as well as limit my public interactions It isnt hard to wear a mask its not hard to use common sense even if youre vaccinated Weve had a hospital in my metropolitan area that had 20% of the admitted covid patients fully vaccinated It all depends on when your state started doing vaccines and how long ago it had been since you got yours And we will see a lot more of these so called "breakthrough" cases regardless of vaccination rates And government officials have been warned already of this and the CDC has discussed this internally and a lot of people are concerned about the effectiveness of the vaccines The mask mandate should have never been removed and local governments have also failed their constituents,mrnight8,16278464230,1

My slight chance of dying has no effect on you Why cant we go back to normal why do you insist on wanting everyone to be vaccinated if you are safe? Are you going to ban fast food? High fructose? High sugar? Opioids? Over eating? Those are killers as well and at a much larger scale Why dont you care if Im morbidly obese and at risk of death but care if I can get infected from Covid? I know that the obvious answer will be "you can create a new variant" but think about it The variants we have now have been from all over the world Meaning that unless 100% of the world population is vaccinated with a vaccine that is effective 100% variants will always be a thing So again if you are vaccinated and I choose to be unvaccinated what is stopping us from going back to normal?,trolololoz,16278309140,-4

gyd6qgd,ndkvik,Its too early for masks off in public indoors We should wait until 1 There has been enough time for everyone who wants the vaccine to be FULLY vaccinated including in blue areas where appointments have been less available Many age groups have only been recently eligible in some states Also dont forget people without car access need more time 2 At least 50% of the total population is FULLY vaccinated (that means a full 6 weeks after first dose) 3 Ideally until cases are down but if idiots stop us from achieving that this summer we can at least keep masks on until the only people left 12 or older and not FULLY vaccinated are TRULY just the anti-vaxxers 4 The most ideal of all would be for most people to keep wearing masks indoors in public until fall so the 2-11 age group could be included This would also crush the case numbers even more Obviously its fine for fully vaccinated people to have private unmasked indoor parties but in public a lot of lying unmasked people just means that people still waiting for their appointments and partially vaccinated people are now forced to stay at home even more than before or may be in an unsafe environment at work Because other peoples masks protect you more than your own mask And there are definitely going to be some people who stop wearing a mask just because no one else is wearing masks or because someone is harassing them for still wearing a mask,kittey257,16211982160,2

The amount of individuals who would follow a religion that specifically states they can not have a vaccine due to their theological teachings HAS to be minuscule and I personally feel most people saying its a religious reason are liars > Buddhism - Buddhism has no central authority that determines doctrine Vaccination is widely accepted in predominantly Buddhist countries > Christianity - The Christian faith consists of multiple different denominations which may differ in theological approach to vaccines > The following Christian denominations have no theological objection to vaccination: Roman Catholicism Eastern Orthodox Oriental Orthodox Amish Anglican Baptist The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormon) Congregational Episcopalian Jehovahs Witness - Note: This denomination originally denounced vaccination but revised this doctrine in 1952 An article in a recent issue of the churchs newsletter promotes vaccination to avoid infectious diseases Lutheran Mennonite Methodist (including African Methodist Episcopal) Quaker Pentecostal Presbyterian Seventh-Day Adventist Unitarian-Universalist The following denominations do have a theological objection to vaccination: Dutch Reformed Congregations - This denomination has a tradition of declining immunizations Some members decline vaccination on the basis that it interferes with divine providence However others within the faith accept immunization as a gift from God to be used with gratitude Faith healing denominations including: Faith Tabernacle Church of the First Born Faith Assembly End Time Ministries Church of Christ Scientist - One of the basic teachings of this denomination is that disease can be cured or prevented by focused prayer and members will often request exemptions when available However there are not strict rules against vaccination and members can receive required vaccinations > Hinduism - Hinduism has no prohibition against vaccines While Hindus venerate cows trace bovine components of certain vaccines have not been identified as a theological concern > Islam - Islam has no prohibition to vaccination There have been several gatherings of Muslim leaders scholars and philosophers to address the theological implications of ingredients in food and drugs including vaccination The Organization of Islamic Conference and 15th annual conference of the International Fiqh Council both concluded that vaccination is acceptable under Islam The Islamic Organization for Medical Sciences concluded that porcine gelatin used in vaccines is acceptable Some muftis (experts in Islamic law) hold that immunization is obligatory (wajib) when the disease risk is high and the vaccine has benefits that far outweigh its risk > Jainism - Jains follow a path of non-violence toward all living beings including microscopic organisms Jains do allow cooking the use of soap and antibiotics and vaccination because this destruction of microorganisms even though regretted is necessary to protect other lives > Judaism - Judaism supports vaccination as an action to maintain health and also as a parental responsibility to protect children against future infection In Judaism the concept of Pikuakh nefesh acting to save ones own or anothers life is a primary value While some vaccines containing porcine derived gelatin Jewish scholars agree that porcine gelatin in injectable form is acceptable > Scientology: in an interview for BeliefNet Rev John Carmichael of the Church of Scientology stated that there are no precepts or strictures about vaccinations within Scientology https://wwwvumcorg/health-wellness/news-resource-articles/immunizations-and-religion,cats_catz_kats_katz,16300867500,83

gv3ezd1,mtzjkn,Kids next please We dont need to wait a year like some of the schedules are showing This virus puts ~~1%~~ some fraction of infected kids in the hospital We probably already have enough safety data from early trials to show that the vaccines arent putting anywhere near that number in the hospital In fact I have not heard of a single incidence of a negative effect on children and there already are numerous studies going on worldwide as well as off-label use for at-risk children in Israel We should allow kids to get vaccinated as soon as we are past supply constraints for adults and we have some safety data showing lower risks from vaccines than the virus -- a threshold that may have already been met in some places I dont want to delay my daughters vaccination one minute longer in service of some high-minded strategy of avoiding tiny risks getting blown up in the media to avoid vaccine hesitancy As soon as the benefits outweigh the risks for MY CHILD I want her to get a shot,jabbanobada,16188479620,-4

Is it "anti-vaccine misinformation" to question whether someone who has previously been infected with SARS-COV-2 and carries antibodies really needs to be vaccinated?

hpkmphd,rm4ymn,If this holds up under peer review this is a very good thing However this winter will likely still be tough because so many people are still unvaccinated delta is still common and even if omicron has a significantly lower chance for hospitalization it appears to spread rapidly meaning a large number of people could become infected and a relatively small percentage of a very large number can still be a relatively large number I worry about our hospital system Nurses especially have had to put up with more than they should have had to put up with They are getting burnt out We cant expect them to continue to put their physical and mental health at risk to keep the system from collapsing We need more nurses and CNAs and we need them now You can help: wear a mask get vaccinated and boosted and take all the normal precautions,whodo-i-thinkiam,16401908740,1

gzw0xq0,nniy3y,Not necessarily employers but heres a fun read about this type of stuff Real Life Example: Massachusetts Mandates A Vaccine In Jacobson v Massachusetts (1905) Mr Jacobsen refused to obey a law requiring that everyone in Cambridge receive a smallpox vaccination At the time a smallpox epidemic was raging Jacobson faced a fine or imprisonment if he failed to take the vaccine Jacobsen argued that forcing him to get the vaccine violated his fundamental liberty which included freedom to control his own body The State argued that the health risk was urgent that widespread vaccination was needed to protect everyone against smallpox and that any harm to individual liberty was a price worth paying given the severe threat of smallpox The Supreme Court acknowledged that both sides had a point On one hand the Court noted that "when faced with a society-threatening epidemic a state may implement emergency measures that curtail constitutional rights so long as the measures have at least some "real or substantial relation" to the public health crisis "On the other hand the Court recognized Jacobsens argument and agreed that the vaccine order did impact liberty and personal freedom The court cautioned that "a law purporting to protect public health may nevertheless be invalid if it "has no real or substantial relation to those objects or is beyond all question a plain palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law" In short while the court balanced the two competing concernsliberty and public safetythe court came down squarely in favor of public safety holding the vaccine order was valid given the seriousness of the threat The Court said that "the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States does not import an absolute right in each person to be at all times and in all circumstances wholly freed from restraint" But the Court also warned that any if a law goes too far in restricting liberty if the law is in place for too long or reaches too far or if the goal of the law can be achieved by less invasive measures then the court may well strike down the law,LazyKidd420,16223088990,1

ht6eu3j,s6wzbk,An old friends brother died of covid last weekend She would not answer if he was unvaxxed but he clearly was They all are unvaxxed in their family and he was an otherwise healthy person She was at least honest that he was in the ICU with covid on her social media posts but wouldnt answer questions about if he was vaxxed I mean at this point most of the people dying of covid or even hospitalized are unvaccinated Its not a mystery ETA since this is coming up in comments: Im not the one asking her if he was unvaccinated Other people on her social media have asked hersome trying to make the point that he probably would not have died if he had been vaccinated and several others trying hard to argue that he was secretly vaccinated and that gave him covid and is why he died from covid or the "kill shot"because he got the vaccine and didnt tell anyone ( he didnt) The whole extended family is anti vaccine so the odds are he was not vaccinated especially since he was hospitalized and died Do I think people should ask someone who is grieving a question like that to further an agenda?

h9yopvs,p9dd93,I disagree - a little The tide has turned already with companies using double vaccination as their way to get people back into the office - at least for now In short "*if youre double-vaxxed youre as safe as youre ever going to be so for you people there is no longer an excuse to not return to the office*" Those who refuse to get vaxxed and/or return to the office will just have to find new employment Whether this holds will be a company-by-company deal A company which has an exodus of employees may well have to reconsider And of course being double-vaxxed is no guarantee of not catching Covid and falling ill A boss who loses double-vaxxed employees to Covid after implementing a back-to-the-office rule may find themselves in hot water The longer remote work remains the more it becomes the norm and a return to the old ways unlikely However the success - or not - of vaccinations and whether new Delta-like variants emerge (not to mention brand new novel viruses) will be the ultimate guide We are a very long way from knowing what the end state will be,TheFirstMinister,16296713520,2

h9ysw34,p9dd93,Ah the unintended upside of COVID It forced the world to try WFH insomuch as jobs supported it For many this means living where they want instead of where the company happens to be usually in some expensive metro area where homeownership is out of reach especially for younger employees early in their career track I sold my LA County townhome made a healthy profit in a sellers market and upgraded to my first-ever single family home with lots of room a 3-car garage solar etc all for about what I was paying in LA Plus Im much happier without a grueling commute every single day no matter how bad I feel in the morning With the old system if you felt sick you might call out and feel better later in the day At home you can just start later or more slowly and ease into work Way less missed days way more productivity and no precious time lost to commuting Commuting doesnt just eat up time it adds stress adds wear and tear to vehicles and consumes precious energy we could normally use for work tasks Thats assume we even make it to where were going without tickets accidents etc And believe me Ive had a few accidents on the way to work all the fault of someone else or interactions with road-debris Sometimes the traffic is so bad that a 1 hour commute is 5 hours Yes there was one night where it took my girlfriend 5 Hours To Get Home Needless to say she called in sick the next day And because employees often lack imagination and make everyone come in around the same time traffic and misery is maximized No such issue with WFH No wonder the real-estate market has been going crazy everywhere even if a lot of agents dont really get whats happening,Wolkenflieger,16296733390,2

h9zjtur,p9dd93,I have lifelong friendships and business references from working with people in an office It sounds great maybe if you are young and still in touch with school/university people for your social life Even having offices move to WFH seems great because all your coworkers are in the same area and you already have closer bonds from knowing them in-person so even over video it seems a bit more fun Well over time workers will come and go and fewer and fewer new hires will be "local" to you Though you will have social "zoom meetings" it just wont have the same impact For the past 6 years Ive worked either remotely or with a large part of the team being remote so COVID wasnt the start of this for me As Ive noticed almost nobody keeps in touch after changing jobs from these remote teams Apart from perhaps a reference for a job application there is little to zero contact No long term friendships no long term anything Sure sometimes when someone would move to a new job you might chat quite a bit talk about things but usually those fizzle to zero rather quickly However I have plenty of friends held for decades gained from working together in person We still go out to hang talk over voice and chat play online and in-person games grab some drinks or see a show Those remote people on the "Chicago Team" of a job from five years ago I struggle to remember their names now Long term this will probably damage cities and urban centers Think the rise of the automobile and massive efficient highways created suburban sprawl? Hold your beer for the new WFH economy The continent will likely become coast to coast suburbs with neighbors with tall fences who hardly know each other Its okay you can watch movies in your home You can watch sports in your home You can see concerts in your home You can have your groceries delivered Fine dining some driving service will bring you food from that local restaurant if it really exists Perhaps Taco Bell now? Welcome to your home your prison I cant wait for the downvotes here I can almost smell them Of course some of what I am saying might not completely come to be but without a doubt its a strong possibility I guarantee this first taste of 100% remote working seems great now but long term the unintended consequences have not been fully considered And by the time those consequences are more strongly realized it would probably be impossible to go back to the office or at least a long uphill battle,RedditRage,16296866320,2
ha0u59n,p9dd93,I feel the pandemic has made us all realize that in light of the technology we all use to work its extremely antiquated to have "ass in seat" workers 5 days a week Remote working in certain buisnesses is more efficient less costly and has the added benefit of being able to recruit talent from anywhere and save the company tons of money on unneeded office space It also exposes the extra fat your company can trim Its a win win win Old school buisness owners who could be on board but arent are only that way because they are old and they somehow feel like they are ripped off of they have to pay employees who get to stay in comfy clothes all day and have tv on in the background while they work Part of your perceived value is the "time you give up" not the job you do which is so backwards It should be all about the job you do whether it takes 6 hours or 12 not being miserable and trapped in a place you dont want to be,guitarguy35,16297203620,2

h9y46xe,p9dd93,Good All these companies claim that they want to be environmentally friendly carbon neutral and a safe place for their workers are just a bunch of hypocrite tools However when a GOLDEN opportunity as we have now presents itself to effectively change the *status quo* and achieve all those goals they get cold feet and wanna go back to their "one trick pony show" The sad thing is that there are no excuses: all the communication technologies required to these sweeping changes exists and the employees welcome the change But I reckon most managers are terrified of these changes since it would make painfully clear that some (not all) are just "disposable heroes" that bring zero value to the bottom line On the other hand the Corporate Real-estate lobby - with many billions at stake - is just too strong to let this happen without a fight,optimal_random,16296621230,1

h3yaqxw,ocwhp4,Im glad this is here because I didnt want to post and I cant So here is the thing before the pandemic I had asthma an issue I had struggled with all my life and more I constantly got sick starting usually with colds then respiratory infections walking neumona chronic sinus infections all of this before ultimately getting better and slowly starting the same cycle all over again from year to year with varying degrees of severity fluctuating throughout my life After 2020 specifically January or maybe December year previous I had come back home to Oregon because I was chronically ill and unable to eat food I had gone from 220lb to just 147 in two months That issue is still on going I only mention it to make known that I had previously been in a failed physical state as well prior to the outbreak When the outbreak occurred it did so in Hillsboro Oregon the city we lived in at the time and we had already been sick all of us with respiratory issues Something were all well familiar with and more and equipped to deal with it since it runs in the family It passed like nothing for my family but I as per usual began my long cycle starting with the initial cold step; however when it came to the respiratory infection step everything changed In the past my mucus at this point would be thick heavy and brown and it would make it extremely difficult and painful for me to remove it by force namely deliberately coughing it all up over and over again until all of it for that day was gone and then sleep rinse repeat until fully recovered people I am poor as SHIT! When its your whole Life! You find a way Anyways I got to that step but this time my mucus had changed It was now white like histamine light stringy and sticky This made it near impossible to cough out The only reason my method had worked in the past was because it was near solid when brown and I could use the muscles around my lungs to forcefully eject the solid mass once it had built to a certain level Now as right now it just stays as a light presence in my lungs but at that time I tried wildly to eject it to the point that I may have either dislocated my collar bone documented as having been dislocated as a child or my shoulder I dont know for sure I tried and failed but its ok I was for reasons I wont get into examined against my will at a hospital some time after these events and they cleared me as never having had the corona virus subsequently released from unmentioned hospital Since that time my mucus has not gone back to the way it was and Ive not gotten any colds sinus infections none of it I started gaining my weight back more my muscle is rebuilding with very little effort and I have not changed my diet I eat virtually nothing and I mean that I am daily on a starvation diet My wife currently is trying to follow me she is at 114lb meanwhile eating less than she does I currently am just under 180lb I ate steak two days ago I virtually only eat meat these days Here is what I know Prior to the outbreak I was withering and I had been fighting respiratory issues my whole life despite making more than the usual effort to maintain my health through rigorous diet and exercise which had wained in the last three years leading up due to family a child full time work and marital stress Currently I am demonstrably better No changes to my diet since 2019 which consist of regular daily fasting only drinking milk sometimes mixed with peanut butter and a banana once or twice daily and occasionally red meat and sea life No changes to my family whom I still continue to struggle with daily weighting heavily on my psyche Ive been out of work since 2019 so that has not changed but things overall in my family and my living situation has improved Nevertheless the bigger factory being diet has not changed but my mucus has Im writing this while caring for my eight month old son one of two so spare me some consideration here if youre still reading lol in conclusion I got better after the pandemic and although I was told I had not been infected I believe that I was and I also believe that Ive overall as a life form become stronger as a result Im changing physically and physiologically for my betterment and that makes me genuinely wonder if vaccinating myself against these possible natural dangers is not the wrong way to go? Are we not looking for that key to open the door to the next phase of biological evolution? Or are we just waiting for Elon and machines to make things easy for us? Im not sure I want to follow that path Not anymore Not since getting sick and better for it Comments??,FightingDad,16253423880,1

hb1o56y,pf4633,Moderna Incs Covid vaccine generated more than double the antibodies of a similar shot made by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE in research directly comparing immune responses to the inoculations A study of almost 2500 workers at a major Belgium hospital system found antibody levels among individuals who hadnt been infected with the coronavirus before getting two doses of the Moderna vaccine averaged 2881 units per milliliter compared with 1108 units/mL in an equivalent group who got two jabs of the Pfizer shot The results published Monday in a letter to the Journal of the American Medical Association suggested the differences might be explained by the: higher amount of active ingredient in the Moderna vaccine -- 100 micrograms versus 30 micrograms in Pfizer-BioNTech longer interval between doses of the Moderna vaccine -- four weeks versus three weeks for Pfizer-BioNTech Modernas vaccine was associated with a two-fold risk reduction against breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to Pfizers in a review of people in the Mayo Clinic Health System in the US from January to July The results were reported in a separate study released ahead of publication and peer review on Aug 9,actualtext,16304105170,2894

gwja6gl,n2hns4,**Michigan is now hospitalizing more people under 40 than those over 80 for COVID-19** Dr Stacey Sensor says her 18-year-old son a high school senior is "one of the healthiest people I know" "He works out every single day at five oclock in the morning" said Sensor a Gaylord physician "He takes all these supplements He only eats healthy And he got COVID at the gym "He was quite sick for about eight days" she said "So Im telling you that it doesnt matter what supplements you take what your age is Even in the healthiest individual they still can get it and they can still become very sick and then the effects can be there for quite some time" Its a cautionary tale she said for people who see COVID-19 as a serious health threat for the elderly but a much more benign illness for younger healthier people In fact Michigans current coronavirus surge has turned that assumption on its head: Last week the state was averaging more hospital admissions for COVID patients under 40 than patients age 80 or older The former was about 78 a day compared to 50 for the latter according to data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services The biggest reason for the demographic shift experts say: The difference in vaccination rates About 74% of Michigan residents age 70 and older have gotten at least one dose of vaccine and two-thirds are fully vaccinated For those 16 to 49 the numbers are 36% who have gotten one dose and 23% fully immunized; there is no vaccine authorized for children under 16 Also contributing to the surge of virus among young people is the spread of variants that are both more contagious and more lethal; the tendency of many younger adults to disregard COVID-19 guidelines and the fact that schools have reopened "Its definitely become more of a young person disease now probably because they havent been vaccinated and theyve been more likely than older folks to go out and about be in close contact with others and go to gatherings" said Dr Mark Hamed a physician who is medical director for Huron Lapeer Sanilac Tuscola Alcona Iosco Ogemaw and Oscoda counties The numbers bear that out In the first year of the pandemic Michigan residents age 60 and older accounted for 23% of cases; its now 13% Conversely those under age 20 accounted for 13% of cases during the first 12 months of the pandemic; its now 25% The chart below shows the April case numbers by age group compared to the monthly average through March 2021 as well as compared to December 2020 during the fall surge [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/WNTiwqVd1gGfPM09p2D0qzVgFZY=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/VQGMMSPTZNGADOVJQPKGAWILMQPNG) In theory thats actually a welcomed shift from the standpoint that old age is easily the biggest risk factor for being hospitalized or dying of COVID-19 But experts have been taken aback by the spike in COVID-19 hospitalizations among younger adults and children Compared to the height of the fall surge in early December Michigans average daily hospitalization admissions for COVID-19 are up 33% for those age 18 to 29 58% for thirty-somethings and 64% for those in their 40s Meanwhile hospitalizations for those age 80 and older are down 60% compared to December [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/86v1e7Apdm4-zWbHd-9Q7X4rAh0=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/RPEUG3IW5JGXTF6HQYL2RBK67Upng) "Its like you take what we were seeing before and shift it down by one or two decades" said Dr Joel Fishbain an infectious disease specialist for Beaumont Hospital in Grosse Pointe "Weve got 20-year-olds who are getting admitted and 30-year-olds requiring oxygen which we never saw before and needing as much treatment as we can give them Weve got 40- and 50-year-olds ending up on ventilators" Pediatric cases also are up Last week the state was averaging almost 10 hospital admissions a day among pediatric patients with COVID-19 triple the number in mid-February Deaths among children and younger adults have spiked too In the first 13 months of the pandemic there were six deaths among children ages 10 to 19 In the past month four deaths were reported Another 65 deaths were reported in April for 20- and 30-somethings quadruple the monthly average The chart below compares April deaths to the monthly average through March 2021 as well as to confirmed COVID deaths in December The numbers show how deaths among seniors plummeted in April compared to December as a result of vaccinations while coronavirus variants spiked deaths among unvaccinated people under age 50 [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/caQyJGE9C2BiswUM2ThU22RJumk=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/ZXCIGC7VWZCN7H65ULFSFE4GPIPNG) Deaths and hospitalizations arent the only concern While most COVID patients under age 50 "dont get severely ill there are a growing number of people who have long-haul COVID symptoms" said Dr Liam Sullivan an infectious disease specialists with Spectrum Health in Grand Rapids "They have problems with smelling with taste with concentration with memory with fatigue with night sweats "So even though they had a mild illness the first time around theyre still dealing with these things month and months later and thats not something you want to deal with when youre 25 or 35" he said "Of course you dont want to deal with it at any age but especially when youre in the prime of your life" And for women the research is growing on the dangers of COVID-19 during pregnancy Dr Kurt Wharton an Oakland County obstetrician currently has four pregnant patients in intensive care units battling COVID-19 All four are "fighting for their lives" said Wharton who works at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak While COVID-19-related deaths among pregnant women remain very rare Wharton and others say the evidence is growing that coronavirus during pregnancy can put a woman at a much higher risk of preterm birth preeclampsia and admission to the ICU and/or intubation especially if the woman has pre-existing conditions such as high blood pressure obesity diabetes or heart disease Evidence growing on COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy: Virus is dangerous; the shots are not Doctors offer several theories on why more younger people are getting significantly ill with COVID-19 in the current surge One is the spread of variants which are both more contagious and more lethal The variants are "stickier" Hamed said which means it takes less exposure to make someone severely ill or even symptomatic Wharton noted the same pattern happened during the 1918 influenza pandemic The initial surge in the spring of 1918 primarily impacted the elderly and babies But the virus mutated and came roaring back in the fall of 1918 and its primary victims during that surge were younger adults "History is repeating itself" Wharton said Another issue suggests Hamed and others: More unvaccinated people are gathering in groups without masks That increases the risk of exposure to a higher viral load which has been associated with more severe disease "The best mask you wear the less viral load you inhale" Wharton said On top that many schools have reopened and children and younger adults in particular are resuming their pre-pandemic social lives "You can see it" Wharton said "Younger people are all out in groups again walking down sidewalks shopping going to restaurants and bars together They just think theyre invulnerable" The good news is that COVID-19 vaccinations have proven "wildly successful" in significantly reducing the chances of getting the virus and spreading to others Sullivan said And just as vaccinations have blunted spread of the virus among senior citizens the spread of COVID among younger adults can be stymied through immunization shots Vaccination programs "really need to target the younger people right now" Sensor said "Theyre the ones who are getting sick Weve done a really good job of vaccinating our older population but to really move forward and get out of this pandemic we really need our younger people to step up to the plate and get the vaccine to protect themselves and protect their families",itsdr00,16198732450,154

gz93hbu,nj6me5,This is all so strange to me I grew up in Quebec where the medical age of consent is 14 There are some special considerations for teenagers 14-18 undergoing major procedures or being hospitalized But for basic healthcare you even get full privacy protections from your parents At 14 I could have gone to the doctor and gotten any necessary vaccinations without my parents knowledge If I had a disease I didnt want my parents to know about I could see a doctor and get a prescription without any reference to my parents My parents were very pro modern medicine and I didnt have anything embarassing going on so it didnt come up much But I did enjoy the freedom and flexibility of not having to bother with permission slips and being able to go to the doctor alone Obviously this is a lot easier in a place with universal healthcare I just presented my medicare card (or number and expiry date) and the government paid the clinic My parents job or ability to pay was totally irrelevant But it always surprises me when laws seem to treat 17yo the same as babies An older teenager may lack some of the life experience maturity and judgment to make all their own decisions but they have some significant abilities and agency and the law should respect that If youre old enough to be criminally charged you should be old enough to choose to get a vaccine or antibiotics for a UTI or whatever,MathAndBake,16218445350,2

hmetpy9,r42hz6,I find myself having a hard time with some of the good news posts when Im not sure if theyre good news or not Any given group of 30 people who test positive are going to mostly have mild symptoms Its that one in 20 that ends up with serious trouble and typically those people are less healthy or older The problem with Covid has always been that the infectiousness makes that one and 20 a huge number when it hits millions of people So 5 to 30 people that are healthy enough to travel or young enough to travel might not be the best basis for making any conclusions So I guess its good we dont see extreme illness or some big change there it is sounding at a minimum similar to other types of Covid But I guess Im not ready to make any conclusions about whether its milder until we see a few hundred or thousand people with it,thestereo300,16381149010,56

h1rvgll,nzm2oo,I live in UT one of the states with a lower vaccination rate and a rise in infections Before when masks were still mandatory there was a significant number of people who would refuse to wear a mask or wore it like a chin daiper Businesses didnt even bother enforcing the rules despite their own signage As soon as the mask mandate was lifted not a mask in sight Sure there were still a few of us holdouts who put up with the dirty looks but in general people were too eager to discard the masks Personally the slim chance that as a fully vaccinated person I can still transmit covid is enough to inconvenience myself with a few minutes of mask wearing every day Its like firing a gun in the air its unlikely that someone will get hit by a falling bullet but its not impossible and the consequences can be devastating Because of the unvaccinated the US (and the world) will probably be dealing with this for the remainder of 2021 However at a certain point when everyone has had ample time to get vaccinated or the economy can no longer run on a deficit we may just have to take a leap of faith and let the unvacvinated reap the consequences of their choices,Reno83,16237044250,2

In terms of covid deaths or fatal aftermaths versus being vaccinated Im pro vaccination but also pro having the option (in many cases like the recent airlines mandatory vaccination protocol) of choosing whether to vaccinate or not I had arguments with some family members; 1 member is crazy watching and reading major doctors about the side effects of covid vaccine: something like these vaccines are 50% more deadly than any other vaccine but i told him bro a pencil might be 50% deadlier than a pillow that doesnt make it "dangerous" and he floods me with reliable sources,B0ssnian,16236810540,-18
h28g44h,nzm2oo,most of the comments in here make me realize the internet is full of people that just read headlines and never the article The article headline is flimsy at best based on the data as I see no strong correlation between covid numbers rising and getting the jab There are almost equal amounts of low vax rates and low cases as there are high vax rate low cases and further pa for example is almost above the national avg and yet advertises over a 70% vax rate If you consider those that had covid plus those that have been jabbed shouldnt pa be at herd immunity? What this also doesnt take into consideration are variants In certain counties which they curiously picked but I probably would have too in my study there is no differentiator for variants We are already seeing strong real world data showing that many of the vaccines are very ineffective against the D variant originally discovered in India Indias numbers have plummeted but there are widespread reports of falsification of data there so much like Chinas reporting I dont think we can trust that this will just disappear I think the UK is our canary in the coalmine at this point so early into the emergence of this variant There are many folks like myself that just simply dont trust the science behind so much of what has occurred since day 1 of this modern day plague Being allergic to PEG to the point that using shampoo with it causes a mild rash I was told not to take the current offerings and wait for better news to come out for the J/J But all we hear from them is bad news between blood clots and corrupted vials in the millions I feel like the entire globe especially reddit users would like to over simplify vaccines and how to stop this disease Remember the idea of a manufactured disease was laughed at and even censored on these very forums not too long ago Now both sides of the political spectrum are realizing there was an orchestrated cover up by Peter Daszak So what new discoveries will there be about the variants the effectiveness claims of the current vaccines against the new variants and long term effects of the vaccine that lets not forget were originally slated for emergency FDA clearance for older and immune compromised individuals because the potential risk of the vaccine far outweighed the potential risk of covid which for those in that category was a very strong chance of death or at a minimum a painful long possibly perpetual recovery period Harvard and Yale doctors came out together and said there is no reason to vaccinate the young the risks are unknown and the risk of covid for those is also low: [https://wwwmsncom/en-us/health/medical/harvard-stanford-doctors-say-mandating-the-coronavirus-vaccine-unethical/vi-AALbqNq?ocid=entnewsntp&pc=U531](https://wwwmsncom/en-us/health/medical/harvard-stanford-doctors-say-mandating-the-coronavirus-vaccine-unethical/vi-AALbqNq?ocid=entnewsntp&pc=U531) Heres my problem with their statements though As someone pointed out the effectiveness of the vaccines are high and your risk of having a break through case drops dramatically if others are also vaccinated Younger people have been known to be asymptomatic and as such are more likely to spread it as younger people are generally more social in person than older people I dont have the answers but to try and paint this as a black/white conversation is foolish I hope the vaccinated dont have long term health issues but if they did you could bet they wouldnt come back on these forums and apologize to those of us that cant get the current vaccines or are fearful because our scientists and medical community especially our government has shown to be at best a bit inept confused and politically motivated,HyprSl0th,16240387040,0

h0jsums,nrqtko,Ive worked tending bar or retail since 1991 Interact within 1 meter of hundreds of people a day for 30 years Used to catch every respiratory infection going Used to think Flu must be incredibly rare though because Ive only spent a week in bed wishing I was dead twice in those 30 years What I learnt during Covid is that there are in-fact Asymptomatics to the Flu too and people whos immune system deal with it quickly and effectively that never get uber sick with it and a flu for them ends up feeling just like a bad cold to many/most other people whereas for many/most people a Flu will floor them and send them to their beds for a week or more and make them wish they were dead Anyway havent had a single respiratory infection since about 2013 Not one!! ie No sore throats no weakness fatigue fevers chills sinus congestion blowing shit of of my nose every 10 minutes etc etc All that exposure over all those years to every single Rhino/Adeno/Corona/Flu virus going has probably rendered me immune to nearly every variant of all the common respiratory infections out there or certainly given my immune system all the tools or headstarts it needs to deal with most things out there Ive just spent 18 months serving hundreds a day with no mask but a plexiglass screen between me and the mostly mask wearing customers in my well ventilated convenience store where the permanently open door is 2m from the service counter where the register is All of the above likely did their part but in all likelihood I probably still caught Covid but was Asymptomatic thanks to all that previous respiratory infection exposure especially the cold causing corona-virii Only other explanation I can think of is my Vaping Switched to vaping in 2013 Perhaps all that Propylene Glycol coating my respiratory tract and lungs was a very effective barrier against all the endemic respiratory infections over the last 8 years and all those nicotine molecules plugged into my ACE2 receptors slowed the replication of SarsCov2 long enough for my immune system to eradicate it before I became symptomatic Sill going to get Vaccinated (Pfizer) tomorrow though!

hrnixh3,ryb5hr,The thing we have all been worried about: "When a health-care system crumbles this is what it looks like Much of whats wrong happens invisibly At first theres just a lot of waiting Emergency rooms get so full that "youll wait hours and hours and you may not be able to get surgery when you need it" Megan Ranney an emergency physician in Rhode Island told me When patients are seen they might not get the tests they need because technicians or necessary chemicals are in short supply Then delay becomes absence The little acts of compassion that make hospital stays tolerable disappear Next go the acts of necessity that make stays survivable Nurses might be so swamped that they cant check whether a patient has their pain medications or if a ventilator is working correctly People who wouldve been fine will get sicker Eventually people who would have lived will die This is not conjecture; it is happening now across the United States "Its not a dramatic Armageddon; it happens inch by inch" Anand Swaminathan an emergency physician in New Jersey told me" Like weve been saying it isnt a collapse by fire but rather deprivation,nolabitch,16415724980,1694

hrollh0,ryb5hr,Talking to my sister last night (shes a doctor and was running the triage during her shift that day) she told me: \- Omicron is re-infecting people who already had it Shes admitted multiple (unvaccinated) people in her ICU who had been released from the ICU a few weeks earlier with a clean bill of health The prognosis for re-infected ICU patients is grim \- About 1/3 of her staff is out sick Omicron is ripping through the staff so as some come back others fall ill \- Even though the hospital is woefully understaffed theyre still well over capacity for a fully staffed hospital \- Past reports of "super immunity" for people who had covid and got their vaccinations seem to not apply to omicron \- Her ER is full of patients who should be in hospital beds Many normal medical procedures cant be performed because the patients also have covid so things like psych evals have to be done in the ICU in a negative pressure room rather than in the psych ward which means the ICU needs an empty room before they can happen etc \- The ICU shift is becoming the most sought after shift because so many people are on ventilators that the doctors dont do much and can actually get a rest Think about that What should be one of the most intense shifts is now easy because the people who need that level of attention cant even get a bed due to all of the comatose covid patients \- Finally she re-iterated that unvaccinated people are about 20 times more likely than vaccinated people to end up in the hospital She didnt think any of her current ICU patients were vaccinated Her advice was to not have any heart attacks and dont get into any car accidents for the next few months and she thinks its going to get a lot worse before it gets better She expects that once things get really bad about half the staff will just quit because they cant take it making the problem much much worse This is in California which is in the better half of the country in terms of vaccination and viral spread,Kahzgul,16415864650,277

hqripxf,rt54vc,TLDR; If youre using an antigen at-home rapid test wait until 2-3 days after symptom onset (but quarantine before then ofc) Family of 4 (50M 14F 16F 22F (myself)) We were exposed to COVID either on Christmas or the 26th (a close family friend (50Ms girlfriends son 15M with whom he was in the car with for 3+hours on the 26th) had a fever on the 26th confirmed positive PCR test on the 28th) Weve been quarantining since the 26th Day 0: 50M 16F and I took a QuickVue antigen test on the 28th They were all negative At this point 50M had a scratchy throat and was mildly coughing The rest of us had no symptoms I started getting a tickly throat (that feeling of "oh here it comes") late at night Didnt test 14F that night because the tests arent cheap :) and we were quarantining anyways At this point if one of us had it the rest of us did Day 1: The next morning 14F woke up with a fever Myself and 16F woke up with sore throats a headache fatigue and coughing 50M stayed the same I felt pretty rough that night had intense night-sweats and lots more coughing 14F broke her fever half-way through the day Day 2: 14F and 16F are feeling much better! Yay! Hardly any symptoms just mild coughing and runny nose I have worse coughing fatigue scratchy throat runny nose nausea 50M doing pretty much the same as he was--just a scratchy throat and coughing At this point its just been a bad cold for us or akin to a case of bronchitis We all took more at-home tests: 2 QuickVue 2 BinaxNOW All 4 came back positive Day 3 (today): 50M lost his sense of smell dampened sense of taste This didnt happen during his first run with COVID (April 2020) Still has similar symptoms but theyve gotten better Im doing much better still occasionally coughing & headaches/cold symptoms 14F and 16F are practically symptom-free now just a bit of coughing 14F and 16F were 2x Pfizer vaccinated in June 2021 (date of second dose) 50M was 2x Moderna vaccinated in January 2021 but caught COVID early-on from hospital work in April 2020 Was a fairly severe case lasted 15 months but no hospitalization I was vaccinated 2x Pfizer in April 2021 None of us received the booster yet I think we all caught Omicron as the symptoms are relatively mild 14F 16F and I have never had COVID before A bit sad we caught it after 2 years of not catching it 50M isnt as cautious with masking/avoiding crowded areas procedures as we are Some anecdotal evidence if you will We all tested negative the first round of testing and all tested positive the second round of testing So you may want to wait until 2-3 days after the start of symptoms before you do an at-home test Best of luck to everyone!

hqsktkf,rt54vc,I currently have covid very likely omicron (though I dont know for sure Im sharing symptoms with confirmed omicron cases and not with og/delta cases) and I think there must be an issue with detection and early testing I was symptomatic for four days before I tested positive (symptoms started afternoon of 25th and my lateral flow came back positive on 29th - I then took a pcr test on 30th which was also positive) Alarmingly though I tested negative twice with lateral flow tests on 26th and 27th and also had a negative result from a pcr test taken on 26 And Ive heard of long gaps between infection and testing positive increasingly in the last two weeks Technically given the negative pcr test on the 26th I could have gone back to work and my symptoms would have been dismissed as cold symptoms which is what I think is contributing to the spread People arent testing positive negative quickly and especially if they are asymptomatic are going into the community and unknowingly infecting people in the days before they test positive Fortunately someone else in my household (we think the person who became infected first and so was further into it) tested positive so we just decided to ignore the test results and isolate to be cautious,thatstoomuchsauce,16410330480,3
hqrh4cg,rt54vc,Those who say masks or vaccines would have helped this and blame on others I am really sorry to say but Omicron seems to be not caring about that Just by reading other redditors comments show that I do also think I got one even after getting fully vaccinated etc This one is a completely different one I just hope that this is a sign of Covid19 turning into a common cold,tedbakerbracelet,16410058110,15
hqsgwh1,rt54vc,Because its very mild A lot of people are asymptomatic They dont know they have it and go about their lives I think this is a good thing Its on its way to turn into a mild cold/flu that we dont have to do anything to prevent Lets hope the trend continues,reptargodzilla2,16410295530,5
hqsw0mb,rt54vc,Im at the end of week two of having symptoms Caught it from exposure to a coworker It took 24-hrs for my symptoms to start Despite being fully vaxxed and boosted I had almost all the symptoms including a fever for 3 days It was miserable Now its just like a very minor cold My area is so overwhelmed with COVID right now and with holiday travelers I couldnt get a test until a week after my symptoms started Im hoping to test negative by the beginning of next week because I have a bunch of medical tests scheduled for a different condition but they wont see me until I have a negative PCR test,magicpenny,16410426150,2
hqsxslq,rt54vc,Sister got back from her holiday in spain last Wednesday and tested positive Monday i noticed that my nose was running Took a self test it was positive No other symptoms just the runny nose the whole time not even a fever For me it was almost non-distinguishable from the common cold My nose is pretty much fine currently Double phizer vaxed,Kintler11,16410438590,2

hqt7gdf,rt54vc,1 Its much more contagious 2 A lot more people arent bothering as much or at all with preventative measures such as masks because a lot more people are just so sick and tired of this nonsense that they just have no shits left to give They also understand that if theyre vaccinated (the overwhelming majority at this point are) its practically guaranteed to be nothing more than a mild cold for them so they figure "If I catch it I catch it its no big deal and gets it out of the way plus itll probably give me immunity to this strain" Im one of them,mypervyaccount,16410494710,2
hqtpco5,rt54vc,I know so so many people that have covid right now and none of them is sick One of thef had a fever for two days like a bad cold But she felt very good after those two days I hope that this variant is the beginning of the end of this pandemic,elbrando21,16410576730,2

hqtutvv,rt54vc,Purely anecdotal but I can name more than a handful of people who went to a New Years eve party last night and dozens who had Christmas gatherings with multiple households Same for Thanksgiving CDC told vaccinated people they could do that and they absolutely ran with it But we know the vaccine will just mean they arent as sick Its not preventing most illness So how is it a surprise that following CDC guidelines and having multiple indoor events in the space of a few weeks is going to result in a much higher rate of spread compared to when many of us were being careful?,Reneeisme,16410599500,2

Also sick w/allergies due to drastic change from warm to cold weather a short hair dog etc Got a COVID kit test and tested negative both before I came and before I leave today so thats a good sign Hope the plane ride is alright Its kind of darkly amusing that COVID hasnt touched asthmatics throughout the whole ordeal as much (Im sure it has but I never see any reports and the ones I do see are recovering folks) Like COVID just pulled a "White walker staring at Samwell and just walks by",N00dlemonk3y,16410702260,2
hqvgb35,rt54vc,I really couldnt and cannot wrap my head around people thinking that "just a cold/flu" meant things were normal as if flus and colds dont knock people out of commission every year Im also amazed at just how easily this thing spreads I never see this many of my friends at home with seasonal colds/flus even on the worst years when they work in retail and interact with other people often Yet most of them have been staying home and getting it from their one roommate or friend who happens to go out,RequiemLullaby,16410839990,2

hqsxov7,rt54vc,I was in Norway for three weeks from Nov 14-30th for a work gig Negative daily testing and two negative PCR tests as well Masked at venue and only off to eat I got weird looks everywhere because at the time there were no masking requirements in the country Flew home via Zurich and crashed at home Two days later started getting a scratchy throat Then cough No fever nothing Just felt like jet lag Fourth day back felt like a massive head cold On the fifth day I went and got tested again to be safe - negative Then my wife son and one of our cats all got it All same symptoms Lasted about 10 days All fully vaxxed but Im convinced I brought it home with me Booster is this week,JustSomeAudioGuy,16410437900,1

ha7111a,pamuzn,after pumping the message of "get vaxed resume life" nonstop putting a new message like this out there which will be interpreted as: "on an individual level theres an undefined amount of additional work to be done afterwards and then maybe well see" is counterproductive imo we cant get double the vaccines in our arms to make up for the stubborn idiots we cant put twice the amount of masks on to make up for the people that dont wear them and we cant lockdown twice as hard for the idiots that partied on spring break throughout the previous peaks reward good reward and punish bad the work that still needs to be done is with local leaders hospitals setting policy companies setting policy for staff etc pivoting from "get vaccinated resume life" to "get vaccinated require vaccines for those ready to resume life resume life" seems like an easier more actionable pivot to accomplish something (besides just inspiring defeatism) than "get vaccinated hope that the dumbest lowlifes catch on eventually and maybe next year you get to live again but stay tuned" on a community level if we could require vaccines/proof of negative tests to participate in "normal" life sooner i think hammering that message would do more to incentivize individuals than when only looking at things nationally/globally good luck getting the crowd that has already done everything more or less right during quarantines mandates etc to continue paying attention while they watched a bunch of hicks bury their heads in the sand cancel out any progress and continue to stay tuned in after already sacrificing a year of life i know its complicated but seems so counterproductive not to spend time also highlighting the spots in the country that succeeded and have been able to have more normalcy already and to balance the national/international gloom and doom with the stark contrast from the cities and communities that have done it right look at floridas deaths currently surpassing the deaths of their previous peaks LONG AFTER A VACCINE HAS BEEN WIDELY AVAILABLE TO THEIR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS (eg 999% of the people that die from covid) then look at the cities that have reached 60-70%+ fully vaxed having music festivals outdoors with no burden on hospital capacity and (except for those highly at risk to begin with those in nursing homes or in healthcare or education) apart from slapping a mask on in an uber and grocery store already are back to normal it was (supposed to be) a team effort until there was a vaccine available for the most at risk which many never participated in or actively sabotaged while others did their part but now that there is a vaccine for the majority of the population and the majority of older folks have gotten it it isnt going to be a one-size-fits-all approach for each individual: qualifying for a vaccine vax rates in the individuals community co-morbidity occupation contact (or lack of contact) with at-risk or groups that cant yet get vaccinated all realistically play more of a role on how much "normal" you get to have the broader context is necessary but its an increasingly hard sell in healthy vaccinated populations to continue to buckle down seemingly endlessly when life itself is insanely short my community has done what it takes and it makes no sense to send a message to the group that has followed marching orders to now wait for the lowlifes in florida to catch up and then maybe u get your normal well be getting boosters before they get a faction of these morons vaccinated fuck em i think about all my friends that own businesses in chicago that barely stayed afloat before there was a vaccine reading this seeing this new "maybe" date (when it could instead be as simple as letting businesses set a policy to reward folks for getting vaccinated) because of some downstate/out of state hillbillies and it makes me sick,lisaleftsharklopez,16298309000,4

The Corona Cabinet approved: Insulation for returnees from abroad African variant Omicron (Photo: Reuters) South Africa has transferred new information to Israel - and this is the data | Photo: Reuters The contradictory messages of vaccine manufacturers The test of the effectiveness of existing vaccines against the new variant was in its infancy but Modern CEO Stefan Bensel managed to arouse global concern today when he said in an interview with the Financial Times that he expects a significant decrease in vaccine efficacy But Bensel spoke of a decline in benefit from a disease with symptoms rather than a serious illness - a difference that is known to be dramatic in corona contexts as Pfizer CEO Albert Burla was apt to describe: Defense compared to Delta but that would be the limit In both cases the booster vaccines are expected to reduce the gap dramatically " Burla who promised to know more about the benefits of the vaccine against the variant in about a week and a half said Pfizer had already begun developing a specific vaccine against the variant a few days ago "We know the genetic linkage of the virus we have it - thats how it starts" he explained "We started at risk to produce a vaccine We actually started on Friday to produce a vaccine based on the flooring the DNA template that would allow us to make RNA that would eventually women within that vaccine" Israel meanwhile is waiting for a more categorical statement from the two CEOs and meanwhile relies on data coming from South Africa - where the variant was first discovered - and from which it appears that the omicron is more contagious but is no more violent "Data on the benefits of the vaccine - there may be some partial data from South Africa" Dr Sharon Elrai-Price head of public health services said today during a debate in the Knesset I know they are doing the lab tests as I described to see how useful the vaccine against this variant is " Bennett worried: "There is a lot of uncertainty" Albert Burla and Naftali Bennett (Adapted by Reuters) Burla optimistic Bennett explains why he activated the GSS | Arrangement: Reuters At the same time the government is today approving a memorandum of law that will allow it to extend the decision to allow the GSS to verify the cellular devices of those infected with Omicron or the suspects who were infected with it with high probability - in order to interrupt the transmission chains as quickly as possible But just before the move reaches the Knesset the coalition itself is sharply critical of the law Prime Minister Bennett - who saw for himself how in the ministers WhatsApp groups Ministers Saar Shasha-Bitton Barbibai and Avidar voted against - told today why Israel decided to include the GSS in the campaign despite and perhaps because it is a low number of infected "There is a lot of uncertainty and that is why we are taking these extreme measures" he said in a video call with Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schlenberg "But our advantage as leaders is that once we know more when there is more information - we can let go of those measures gradually" As for the restrictions at Ben Gurion Airport the prime minister has already decided that these will last about two weeks from the date of the decision - and only if the final proof does come that the variant does not endanger the populations immunity or the omicron is already spread in the community - these restrictions will be removed Yaron Avraham participated in the preparation of the article,Serenity101,16383425550,2

hnflckn,r9otza,Ive been teaching in China for 18 years and this is par for the course Ill first say Ive always worked in the private sector and there have been times that Ive been outsourced to public schools on occasion while working with a few schools in the past What a gong show Not criticizing China Just humanity in general So I came **right** after the WHO lifted the SARS travel ban to China Id planned on moving to China earlier and SARS ended up delaying my departure by a few months There are always sick kids coming to school It really broke my heart Id see kids as young as 4 years old coming to class run down and sick It just made me think "if youre going to run your kid into the ground like this at this age what kind of physical condition can you expect them to be in when theyre 30?" When H1N1 was a thing I was working 3 afternoons a week at a high school and DAMN I had classes where students were constantly going to the bathroom to puke their guts out 1/4-1/3 of the students were clearly effected I constantly encouraged them to go home but they didnt see it as an option because their teachers and parents didnt accept the practice of saying home to get better and not risk spreading their illness to others A few years later I had a kid come to school looking kinda sick and before class I asked the girls mother and she upright admitted that she was aware that her child was infected with FMD which can be extremely fatal to humans who are younger/have less developed immune systems I couldnt believe this woman I informed my co-workers of the situation We immediately locked all of the classrooms because we didnt want anyone in the other classrooms to get infected It literally took over an hour to convince the mother to take her child out of the school It was literally impossible to convince her that shed done something wrong by taking her child outside let alone to a school filled with other younglings She attempted to fight the manager when we told her that she wouldnt be able to bring her child back into the school without proof from a local hospital that her daughter was no longer contagious After the insane woman left we spent a few hours sanitizing everything in the school It must have been a weird experience for the kids and teachers in the other classrooms They normally would have finished class a long time ago and would have been let out of the classroom for breaks but they had to just hang out in the classroom while we insured that wed done our best to make sure it was safe for the kids to come out TBH we shouldnt have had anything to do with this process There should have been some division of the government to contact to have them ensure that this is done properly especially given how this disease is famous for coming through areas and taking the lives of children in waves but yeah we didnt have such a luxury at our disposal COVID wasnt nearly as bad The government had clearly learned from SARS and figured out a way to deal with it in their own way After the COVID lockdown had ended it was really nice to see so many kids come to class wearing masks I even had co-workers wearing masks when they had a cold which is something I couldnt have imagined happening ever before COVID COVID really made me question why the hell we havent been wearing masks when under the weather all of these years I think it should be a given You shouldnt be free to spread your germs when youre feeling ill just regardless of whether or not you live in a free country,ThaddCorbett,16387743750,13

h8f0php,p1oqh4,Its no shocker to me A lot of my family and friends live in Florida Back in late June i went down to surprise my father for his 69th birthday I thought since I was fully vaccinated and cases were at their lowest since the start of the pandemic there was never going to be a better time to go I hadnt seen him in 10 years I wasnt sure I would see him again so I took the risk and drove down This trip was highly unusual Normally I would get in contact with everyone and try to spend time with as many people as I could This was more a top secret mission Ive been paying attention to everyones social media posts I knew since i had a high risk son at home there were many folks I did not want to see (He has heart failure one kidney and immuno-compromised from a cancer diagnosis as a toddler)The need to know list was minimal Even though neither of my parents are vaccinated I knew it was ok to visit my father He is living off the system and had most things delivered at his home He only left to buy cigarettes and beer and got them at a window I asked my mom to get tested because she hasnt changed her way of living since all this started Anti masker bible thumping Christian who goes to church and Costco twice a week This church sets aside a half hour after service for fellowship community dining and affection(hugging and spreading love) I visited a handful of friends One group knew i was coming down before anyone else They all were fully vaccinated and quarantined themselves before I arrived Chatting with them made me realize that most Floridians just dont care about following the rules Its always been business as usual down there Theres been major events like concerts live DJ performances and parties weekly Ive seen tons of posts from packed venues Nobody wearing masks all crammed tightly in a building One night I visited my best friend since high school We got to chat while smoking a fat bowl (she bought a new piece just for me for my visit) and she said it perfectly "Florida just dont give a fuck about Covid" Its that frame of mind why Florida will be hit mega hard by this variant Theres a huge number of unvaccinated people down there You have the younger crowd partying like its 1999 mixing with a massive older retired population A recipe for disaster Even with this new variant and numbers skyrocketing they still just dont care With Summer coming to a close soon all of the snowbirds will start arriving again Just in time as the Delta is getting in gear I probably shouldnt have taken the drive down or seen as many people as I did But like I said cases were at their lowest and most of the small number of people I visited were vaccinated I caught a lot of flak once everyone found out I was down and never stopped in Those that knew I was coming also knew the situation with my son and took precaution Most of the time spent together was outdoors and distanced at a persons home The only home I went in was my Fathers I knew it was only a matter of time before a new variant swept through the Sunshine State Im glad I went when I did My dad is a chain smoker and ex hardcore drug addict I never once seen him eat when i was there Beer and cigarettes thats it Didnt matter if it was 8 in the morning or midnight Alcohol and nicotine If you heard him cough you would know he doesnt have much time left on Earth I had to go down to see him when the opportunity was there,ac1dre1gn77,16286075150,97

Im not pointing at strictly Lebron for this ive been seeing a lot of athletes doing this,ozzman1234,16328954830,1
hepv1b0,pxc6hb,Someone stating they were skeptical but eventually came to understand it was the right thing will hopefully be a good message to some people holding out,JaesopPop,16329208800,1

hm9su5x,qpcnyc,You lost me at savings for college Youre spoiling your kids Either they get scholarships or they go to the military and earn their college not gonna pay for my kids Hard times create strong men easy times create weak men Then you dont even live with your family? The idea that you wouldnt be taking care of your sick parent is disgusting to me Thats whats wrong with society Humans used to live in strong unbreakable tribes where the elders were respected and protected Now we put our elders in old people homes or leave them in hospitals Not me I have a 3 story house and multiple acres of land and I have all of my siblings including cousins and niece/nephews living with me! When one of us gets sick we ALL pitch in to take care of them! My great aunt died of cancer just like you said but we didnt have to pay anything after she died We actually got paid Yall make the US look bad but really youre just living wrong Families shouldnt separate they should live under one roof or in the same community within speaking distance,LeviThaKat,16380198270,1
hy5uf8y,szo1gx,My moms had it twice Had the infusion the first time around Has had that memory fog for a month now but insist it wasnt covid just allergies and being tired Told someone else it was one big nothingburger Its not normal how many people lived and have problems and its also brushed off,TheJanks,16456560930,748
hy5rulp,szo1gx,I have a friend who was still fairly young and used to run marathons She ended up getting COVID and was on a ventilator for weeks We thought she was going to die She pulled through but shes never been the same My sister has long COVID from when it tore through our navy in Feb 2020 and struggles to manage her job and kids now Meanwhile Im having to listen to people deny the issue Or even worse say its okay because it only affects old people and people with health problems I already have lung problems and have older people in my life I would hate to lose Ive never understood the lack of empathy these people must have,DisabledMuse,16456550680,120
hy4pedn,szo1gx,But they were old And had pre-existing conditions They would have died anyway (Things Ive actually heard people say about *My Friends* who died of Covid),lindseyinnw,16456406500,1440
hy7131i,szo1gx,Not saying this is normal but there will forever be no accurate total death count from Covid reason being no one knows if the death was due to or with Covid-19 My friends dad works for insurance and told me the corrupt system that was going on If paramedics and doctors suspected any Covid-19 related symptoms from their patients or victims in any deathly cause; marking up that the death was Covid related would instantly give them a Covid relief bonus So with that being said nothing is accurate in this country,flashundredyardash,16456749960,1

hy85da2,szo1gx,Millions dead around the world And still china has had ZERO consequences for their atrocious early prevention **Remember they knew the full extent of the virus in DECEMBER 2019** Then at the end of January they had Chinese new year the largest mass migration of humans in history And what did they do? Kept it quiet arrested whistleblowers and doctors and allowed everyone to go all over the world as normal Maybe purposefully maybe to save face But either way a GROSS disastrous handling of the unfolding events comparable to Chernobyl,Hai_Koup,16456997420,1
hy60eqb,szo1gx,But it is normal We have been spoiled the last 100 years with modern technology but death from disease ill include childbirth is very normal Early death is part of life most people never died of old age This is a normal human situation in fact 1 million or 03% is pretty low for the biggest disaster in 70 years Barely noticable most people dont know 250 people in their daily life so chance of knowing anyone who died is small COVID had no impact on peoples lives aside from the ridiculous overreaction measures from the government,leonard12daniels,16456585740,-1
