h7atstv,ovpxdj,This post appears to be about vaccines We encourage you to read our helpful resources on the COVID-19 vaccines: [Vaccine FAQ Part I](https://wwwredditcom/r/Coronavirus/wiki/faq#wiki_where_can_i_find_information_about_the_mechanism_and_progress_of_vaccines3F) [Vaccine FAQ Part II](https://wwwredditcom/r/Coronavirus/comments/mnitdo/vaccine_faq_variants_chronic_conditions_nsaids) [Vaccine appointment finder](https://wwwredditcom/r/Coronavirus/wiki/faq/vaccinefinder) *I am a bot and this action was performed automatically Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) if you have any questions or concerns*,AutoModerator,16278144410,1
h7bgqj0,ovpxdj,Uh yeah School starts in 2 weeks and I have no choice but to send my asthmatic kid with scarred lungs from dozens of bouts of bronchitis and pneumonia back into the classroom Because Texas isnt allowing virtual learning and our governor signed an executive order to stop schools from requiring masks So I have no choice but to put him back in a classroom of 25 kids breathing all over each other ( and never washing their hands lets be real) hope his vaccine and his mask are enough because nobody else here is going to have their kids wear them voluntarily So you could use "angry" as an appropriate descriptor You could also say terrified Edit: For all those saying either homeschool or move: I am in the process of rearranging my life (work my own education which can and will obviously be put on hold because it comes way behind my kids wellbeing household expenses etc) to accommodate homeschooling but its not an overnight process Im trying He is too young to stay at home while I go to work every day But I have to work to live and I have to have health insurance to cover my sons meds theyre very expensive As for moving do you have any idea how much that costs? I have picked up and moved out of state before thats how I got here Im not native to Texas It costs thousands of dollars Have you seen the rental/real estate market lately? Its insane If I and my spouse leave our jobs to relocate it would be nearly impossible to find the same income and our rent would increase by as much as double People dont always have the privilege of just picking up and moving somewhere else That costs money and lots of it even to just move to another city and not everyone has that kind of money at their disposal,AncestralFoil247,16278291300,2817
h7bc65w,ovpxdj,At the beginning of the pandemic when people were clueless about social distance and I was trying to respect it I was angry A little later when masks were encouraged then mandated and I was wearing them while others werent I was angry When vaccines became available I got vaccinated as soon as I could and others refused playing politics or believing into misinformation I was angry Now that were in the midst of another surge when COVID-19 is now endemic and were just stuck with it because we live in idiocracy Im not angry Im just tired,GrinGrintharl,16278267820,9398
h7bptam,ovpxdj,anti-vaxxers: NO NEW NORMAL! sane people: good news we can get back to actual normalcy if you just get vaccinated anti-vaxxers: NO I WANT OLD NORMAL WHERE I DONT NEED A VACCINE OR A MASK BECAUSE COVID DOESNT EXIST!,superfucky,16278333150,392
h7b153d,ovpxdj,In my country minors need parental permission to get vaccinated Guess whos stuck at 17 and isnt allowed to get the Corona Vax Me! I would get the vaccine but mom says no Edit: 1k upvotes?! Holy Potato! Also relax I will get vaccined at some point maybe after my next birthday maybe before And Im female How funny that many referred me collectively as male especially at the beginning of my comments existence Can I ask why?,ImaGamerNoob,16278203800,1631
h7ay0sg,ovpxdj,So at the beginning of the pandemic with no vaccine these covidiots screwed everyone over by refusing to mask/quarantine/social distance Now that theres a vaccine theyre making things even worse becoming breeding grounds for new variants _sigh_,oh_kapi,16278179910,1473
h7cuv46,ovpxdj,I have an analogy for this; you tell your mom you need $5 to open a lemonade stand because lemons cost $2 sugar costs $2 and everything else is $1 She says "I have no clue if this will even work so Ill give you $1 to start and if you can make any progress with that Ill give you the rest" A day goes by and she comes back to find that as expected you have yet to make any actual lemonade as you need the full $5 to do so she responds with "Why would I give you the full $5 when you cant even make anything with $1?" People refused to do basic things like social distance and wear masks so now when we are at a point where getting a vaccine is becoming the only option left to really fight this thing; people are saying no because clearly the masks and social distancing didnt work so why would the vaccine? And yes I am very fucking angry,Welcome--Matt,16278527290,43
h7b16ln,ovpxdj,Im worried that each new variant that comes out means getting closer to a variant that totally resists the vaccine That wont be good,bean803,16278204110,377
h7bcael,ovpxdj,I am angry My MIL is high risk and refuses to get the vaccine I went to an outdoor concert a few days ago while my husband was visiting them and posted on social media I knew she was going to say something but idgaf anymore Its her choice I got vaccinated Ive been doing my part I should be able to enjoy certain things again She is so afraid of the delta variant she wont even let her vaccinated husband go to the grocery store,hellad0pe,16278268450,182
h7crnxd,ovpxdj,Ive seen (prob unvaccinated) people complaining that vaccinated people are pissed about needing to wear a mask again when "if I have to wear a mask they should too" the thing is most people who are anti-vaxx are also anti-mask If they didnt wear the mask the first time and they wont get the shot what makes people think theyre going to wear the mask now? Im fully vaccinated and yeah it does piss me off that I might have to wear masks again because of a bunch of idiots that refuse to get the shot so we can all move on from this I went into a store yesterday that had a sign on the door "face masks required for everyone" so I had to go back to my car just to find one as Ive gotten used to not wearing them anymore Well when I went into the store this man and his son were in there not wearing a mask Unless they start really ENFORCING the masks (which I think it would be nice if businesses/whenever else would require proof of vaccination if you have it you dont have to wear a mask if you dont mask on or no entry) we are going to be stuck in this cycle for even longer Lots of people are never going to wear the mask or take the shot willingly Im hoping we eventually get to a vaccine mandate Im just frustrated like lots of people that I did my part wearing a mask for over a year and a half (even after I was fully vaccinated for a while) and then there are people that are just ruining it for us,dirty-little-hearts,16278511820,30
h7bkmle,ovpxdj,Is that why vaccinated people are mad? Speak for yourself Im pissed that people are this selfish and ignorant when it comes to protecting yourself and other people We are at a point where this virus could mutate and vaccines will be pointless All because what you can fight the shit on your own? LMFAO yall would have died before modern medicine I have a coworker who isnt vaccinated is about to take a trip across country towards florida Their mentality is that if they havent gotten the virus yet then they probably wont end up getting it at all How selfish would it be for them to contract covid come back shut us down and now i have to miss work with no pay? All because they wanted to go on a trip? I make just enough to get all my bills paid i cant afford that There is no going back to normalcy Shit has hit the fan for us in the united states We need to stop being so selfish and deal with the issues that covid has amplified and uncovered in our country and take responsibility so we can grow to become a stronger more unified nation,foolishsunshine,16278309680,134
h7bo9yd,ovpxdj,How we made it to a point where there was a freely available highly effective vaccine in the first place is a miracle How we do it all again when not if we get a vaccine resistant strain The outcome seems a lot more grim Im seeing people panic buy aging too Which Im sure will be just as problematic as it was last year Im definitely angered Journalism has failed the US Losing trust of the people has cost untold damage Which I guess in turn is ultimately what will happen with a capitalist society Money above all else,dogeatingdog,16278326110,20
h7d8z1r,ovpxdj,Now thats a headline I can agree with Vaccines shouldve never been politicizedgrowing up as a kid we all got vaccinated and no one ever asked what party we voted for etc Loving your neighbor means protecting each other and we need as many people vaccinated as possible I truly feel bad for the immune compromised and all the children who are waiting for approval The world needs more love and no one wants to die get vaccinated!,Drewsthatdude3,16278597890,19
h7cxvh1,ovpxdj,Vaccinated guy here I spend my downtime getting high to distract me from my anger Not at governments not at the virus Its anger at other people Humans I barely tolerate the idea that I am of this species when fellow humans continue to whine and cry and fuss over a modern medical breakthrough like mRNA vaccines I heard on the radio today that the average reading level of American adults is 7th grade How the hell are these people supposed to understand mRNA vaccines?

h7d3xp9,ovpxdj,Almost all of my family is fully vaccinated Two of my cousins wont one is 22 and the other is in her 40s Both say the same thing: "wait until 10 years pass and you have a horrible disease due to the vaccine! Then youll be a commercial on television!" Yes that is their logic Frankly if they get it its their own fault My best friends husband died from the delta variant he was only 37 He was not vaccinated and she was She got covid the same time and was only sick for a week He is gone and leaves his wife and 4-year-old daughter behind This is what I say dont let fear religion politics get in the way of keeping yourself and others safe from covid,allehdally,16278572120,6

h7cw5h4,ovpxdj,We have a roommate a 19 year old yogi girl who has been anti vaccine from the start to the point where shell regularly share Sherri Tenpenny videos with her friend She has prattled off about "my body my choice" the entire time And she just tested positive for covid The minute she tested positive it stopped being just about her body and her choice I had to make several phone calls to my boss to figure out whether or not to come into work (at a childrens hospital) My fianc had to reschedule her work week so that she could work from home All three of us teach at a gym and we had to reschedule meetings find substitutes for classes or cancel our classes all because of her body and her god damn choice Ive had to call my parents and ask them to get tested since I saw them a few days before she was showing symptoms And to make it all worse I have to miss work this week which will eat up the PTO I was saving for a vacation All because of her body and her fucking choice Fuck the anti vaxx crowd fuck Sherri Tenpenny and fuck anyone pedaling the absolute horseshit conspiracies,Takatotyme,16278533600,12
h7cx7lj,ovpxdj,I live in the US My fiancee and son live in the Philippines She and I have both been vaccinated The Philippines is struggling with vaccine supply and the US isnt one of the countries on their list of where theyll let foreigners enter from because the US doesnt have a handle on covid We havent seen each other in person in almost 2 years Thankful for technology like video calling and everything but Id really like to go be with my family and finally get married so we can begin our life together People refusing the vaccine are part of whats making this take longer and "angry" isnt an adequate word to describe how I feel,mausisang_dayuhan,16278538850,4

h7dcrno,ovpxdj,I am angry because here we are getting so close to normalcy and having live concerts sports etc and these selfish stubborn assholes (they are) are just so set in their ways only to complain about a potential lockdown Its like theyre more afraid of a vaccine than a virus I kinda want a vaccine mandate at this point or have more bars and establishments turn people away who havent gotten vaccinated yet,JuniorsEyes90,16278617900,3

h7bmfsm,ovpxdj,Cuz all the fuckers refusing the free vaccine are the same people that had to get inoculated to go to elementary middle high school and college if they went to college Susceptible people believing lies shouldnt have such a great impact on the rest of us even if we have to pass new laws that forcibly vaccinate these people it has to be done,winkofafisheye,16278317880,14
h7c5ua3,ovpxdj,I actually worry about the hatred for the antivax rhetoric escalting My family seems to have a genetically passed on hyper active immune system trait somehow quite a few (not myself) people in fam who cannot get the vaccine (all vaccines are near or are lethal for them) my brother nearly lost both kidneys in grade school after being mistakenly given a flu shot and hes encountered atleast 1 person so far who got right pissy refused to believe him why he didnt have the shot and literally tried to go after his job over it I think their dumbfucks just as much as anyone but please dont forget their are people who CANT get vaccinated All the more reason the rest of us should,Proper_Front_1435,16278407820,7
h7bao91,ovpxdj,Its just like when is this going to end? I understand children under 12 are still vulnerable as they cant get the vaccine yet but I hear that the people dying/being hospitalized are the unvaccinated adults So why do we have to continue masking up for them? Theyre never going to get the vaccine so why do we keep fighting it? We did our part so I dont feel bad if theyre choosing not to get vaccinated,peachpsycho,16278259860,32
h7bkzx0,ovpxdj,work in an office with 2/3 antivaxxers they all "lied" to management to get allowed to come back to work after getting to work from home all last year meanwhile I got stuck out on the pickup counter non-consentually when my job is supposed to be in a cube! these jerkoffs cant even have the common decency to keep up their lie and pretend to have gotten the vaccine like theyre REQUIRED TO in order to not wear masks and such in the office It makes me so mad sadly management doesnt give a shit and wouldve had us all work through the pandemic as per normal if they werent held at gunpoint by the state I am so fucking sick of it,saxGirl69,16278311410,7

h7bumvj,ovpxdj,Just because youre vaccinated it doesnt mean that going right back to the way things were pretty covid is a safe idea Sure if you get infected itll probably be a mild case but we still dont know if vaccines are effective against potential long-term damage,Xzmmc,16278355680,3

h7dhmz0,ovpxdj,I know businesses will never give a shit but the fact that the second the mask mandates ended that businesses allowed everyone to enter massless without checking vaccine status is whats screwed us It creates no incentive to get the vaccine The unvaccinated can return to normal just like everyone else Lets be real those without the vaccine are walking around massless despite the recommendation that they continue to mask up,WarpedSt,16278644210,3

h7bmre0,ovpxdj,After reading comments Im very fortunate of my situation I got my 2nd dose of the vaccine yesterday and where I live we have 0 positive cases except for 2 that were on board two different ships that came in although they never did leave the ship for safety of the public Were now looking at removing the mask mandate on the 9th of August assuming all these numbers stay the way they are I will probably still wear my mask just in case for another while,Xayzu,16278319330,2
h7c13qs,ovpxdj,Im just so fucking sick of everything These people deny that the vaccines are safe despite infinite sources saying otherwise As well as every single arguement they make are disproven They are just trying to be annoying and being dangerous meanwhile Im not for the government being harsh on individuals for doing what they like But unvaccinated people are dangerous,Magnus250,16278385950,2
h7c48me,ovpxdj,Yeah I have a friend like this and it was kinda frustrating TBH He was like "Im not sure about the vaccine I want to see the effects for a while first But I dont really need it anyway All we do is stay in our rooms all the time anyway" And Im like "bro the goal is to NOT have to do that anymore not to keep hiding in our rooms for an indefinite period of time" And then he said that he takes plenty of precautions like wearing gloves when he goes out and I told him that I dont care XD,Iudicatio,16278400380,2

h7d3rl3,ovpxdj,Theres too many of us not doing enough so Im all for someone to be the adult in the room and force masking again Those who can get the vaccine and dont need to be treated like the toddlers they are They are the reason we keep ending up in this variant cycle Grow up and think of others Your freedom is not being infringed upon,devnoid,16278571270,2

h7c4ce3,ovpxdj,Im just tired at how it seems like no matter what antivaxers always win and the punished ones are people who are vaccinated and are being cautious meanwhile antivaxers are living their life as if nothing happens its so discouraging Plus a lot of news articles seem to be doing everything in their power to make it seem like vaccinated people are still in a lot of danger "300 vaccinated people get infected!!" then fail to mention that those 300 people are only like 06% of the total vaccinated people who were exposed and never got sick Im back to being scared thanks to the media and that only fuels the antivax agenda of "Vaccines are useless" Also the amount of people in this sub pushing the "we will never go back to normal cause we will soon have a variant that will render vaccines useless" is astonishing Ive done my part I got vaccinated and stayed home as much as I could Im not going to stay inside being scared while unvaccinated people are outside,lucinasardothien,16278400860,6
h7bs6p8,ovpxdj,what the vaccinated are doing is probably the worst possible thing anyone could do right now far worse than simply not being vaxxed they are acting as incubators for a super virus that will be 100% resistant to the vaccine they will not only wipe out the unvaxxed they will ensure that a strain is produced that cannot be stopped with vaccines,Longjumping-Dog-2667,16278344200,4

h7dhwb8,ovpxdj,Its not just unvaccinated thats creating the problem Unmasking while there is a complete outbreak is leading to the possibility of vaccine resistant variance The vaccinated as well as the unvaccinated are spreading the virus and perpetuating the problem If you dont believe me read this article: [https://wwwnaturecom/articles/s41598-021-95025-3](https://wwwnaturecom/articles/s41598-021-95025-3),bkjack001,16278645620,3

h7diawd,ovpxdj,Not going back to masking; let the unvaccinated reap the consequences of their choice They are the ones who should be masked not me They never shouldve lifted the mask mandates in the first place The vaccine either works or it doesnt If it didnt shouldve kept the masks Im sick of the going back and forth on this shit Im done I will wear masks when required but if Im not required Im not Enough already,keykey_key,16278647800,3
h7c7dkb,ovpxdj,Its funny that the vaccinated think they are immune from the virus and are acting as such The people that survived COVID essentially got a better dose of the vaccine so the unvaccinated who havent contracted COVID are the ones that who should contemplate getting the vaccine but as far as the people who are spreading it are the people who dont believe in masks or the ones who are ignorant enough to o think they are immune to the virus Dumb dumb people Have you ever heard the quote "A person is SMART but People are DUMB as F**k!!",Relli19,16278415120,4

h7djkpg,ovpxdj,And the media does what the media does best: divide the American people The government is whats preventing normalcy not the un-vaxxed 99% of deaths at this point are non-vaccinated the rest of us could be back to normal if it werent for the government holding us back INB4 "but the more times it spreads the more it mutates and itll get worse and maybe the vaccines wont work" Thats happening anyway You dont think this thing is going to keep spreading in pockets of Africa? Theyve still got polio in Africa I guarantee even if we wipe COVID off the map in the West youll still have variants coming from the 3rd world This is a bad argument Stop blaming non-vaccinated people for lockdowns and masks The government is whats slowing us down,Doge_Of_Wall_Street,16278654610,3
h7bnrdz,ovpxdj,Im gonna get downvoted to hell for this But can we please stop posting bullshit headlines like this You can think what you want about unvaccinated people that theyre dumb selfish ignorant all of the above whatever but fucking keep that to yourself and lets try to create actual dialogue with these people rather than getting "angry" at them How the fuck do we (and I mean we as in vaccinated people) expect to encourage the rest of America to get the vaccine when we start the conversation with "Im vaccinated already why arent you vaccinated what are you waiting?? This is all your fault!!" It may be their fault that we cant return to normal and that needless deaths continue on as a result but screaming headlines like that in their face does not communicate the message we think it does Like I said believe what you want about unvaccinated people but no matter how "unreasonable" you think they are they too have their reasons Maybe theyre a minority hesitant about the USs terrible track record with testing vaccines on them maybe theyre overwhelmed with figuring out how to get vaccinated and just dont know yet that its readily available at Walmart via walk-in appointments or maybe theyre stuck in an echo chamber of bullshit because vaccinated people push them to the edge of the circle by asserting themselves as some cult of "superior vaccine believers" Yes I know that sounds ridiculous because "vaccine-believing" is just science but read the headline out loud and pretend for a second that you have a legitimate argument against getting the vaccine - this headline is frustrating for these people and it pushes them even further away I agree that there are people who are absolute whackos that cant be reasoned with But thats a minority of the people holding off getting vaccinated Theres still so many more Americans that can be reasoned with if we just speak to them as equals respect their opinions on why theyre hesitating and let them come to the conclusion on their own terms that getting vaccinated is safe effective and the best shot (no pun intended) at returning the world back to normal,ilikecrabs,16278323790,2
h7c936l,ovpxdj,Ok but isnt this anger a bit misplaced since many Delta studies are inferring that vaccines arent that effective at blocking transmission but extremely effective at reducing the severity of the symptoms?

I made a personal choice I also still choose to wear a mask indoors I will never get angry at someone who has chosen to not vaccinate For all you know they may just want more research to be done about it Or maybe theyre on a Chemotherapy regimen and vaccination is not on the table for them at the moment For those that are unable to get it they can still use other methods to protect themselves like washing hands wearing a mask Hell its super nice now that you dont even have to go into a grocery store You can just order stuff online The best way to help others to be more open minded about getting vaccinated is to first and foremost be understanding and do not belittle or alienate them,bpyle,16278659930,0

h7bvs2r,ovpxdj,I think they are mostly angry at the government lying to them If you are vaccinated it doesnt matter if other people are not vaccinated That is the whole point of getting the vaccine The majority of new cases are in unvaccinated people This is why if youre vaccinated it doesnt matter if others are not The vaccine works The death rates are so low that this is no longer a crisis the requires granting emergency authority to the government They will continue to use fear to try and craft a narrative for political purposes So if youre not vaccinated I think youre making the wrong decision but Im not angry at you You can make a decision for yourself and deal with any consequences that may arise That is what living in a free society means Im angry at the government that is trying to maintain their control over people Im angry at the mixed messaging we have received from the government,treblewdlac,16278361030,1

Perhaps but it also leads us into thinking that EVERYONE who has yet to receive a vaccine is in the "vaccine hostile" camp This type of confirmation bias is not productive and certainly wont help the vaccine hesitant to roll up their sleeves Im not saying I know how the media can encourage those folks but I am saying that them fanning the flames of our anger and frustration is definitely not going to make things any better,AMCorBust,16278315540,-1

h7bun41,ovpxdj,My problem is this: Had the first shot waiting for appt for the second one But now I am reading that people who have been vaccinated are contracting COVID Im all in favor of vaccines - but - if you can still get the disease that you are vaccinated against that doesnt mean you are bullet-proof once you are vaccinated I guess its all a matter of percentages and avoiding getting really sick if you get the virus after vaccination Heres the other weird thing: Ive been reading about people whove had COVID who are not immune to getting it again From what I read the antibodies do not last that long - like only a few months or at least they dont show up on tests How is the vaccine any different?

h7bv5k3,ovpxdj,Worst part is that all these new variants are coming from the bodies of unvaccinated people who go into critical care Allowing them to live on a ventilator just gives the virus a perfect environment to mutate endlessly I listened to a [podcast](https://wwwwnycstudiosorg/podcasts/radiolab/articles/dispatch-14-covid-crystal-ball) where a man in the UK who was sick with covid for weeks was given the vaccine The problem was he already had like 10 different mutations of covid that were created in his body while he was sick When they gave him the vaccine the other mutations quickly took over and killed him Whats really crazy is they sequenced the strains in his body and found he had independently created the same variants found in other parts of the world before they became wide spread The fact we have the same strains mutating independently in different people in different parts of the world scares the shit out of me Just fuck these selfish awful people who wont get vaccinated and stop this pandemic,somecallmemike,16278358080,1

h7cho06,ovpxdj,According to the research being done especially in places like Israel that has a population over 60 at 80% vaccinated by February data is showing the vaccine effectiveness is fading quick and dramatically Had you been vaccinated in January such as myself youll find youre at best walking around with an effectiveness of nearly 20% compared to someone vaccinated in June who is around 80% If unvaccinated people are the only ones getting sick the concern we are seeing wouldnt be there You would be protected with your vaccination and would have little to worry about The truth is we will see more variants and until we have boosters available and ones that can be made quickly before the new variants take hold we will continue to see spikes regardless of previous vaccinations Instead we are seeing vaccinated people spreading the virus and some knowingly I know first hand someone who is currently infected after being vaccinated in april and she continues to work at her job since the symptoms arent bad according to her and she is vaccinated The anti vaxxers are a problem but theyre a distraction from the real issue that your vaccine will only provide so much protection and its not a ticket to do whatever you want If the vaccine worked effectively for the current delta variant they would only be their own problem Kind of like driving a car with a seatbelt The direct impact is only to the individual I have and still continue to wear two masks including an n95 as well as limit my public interactions It isnt hard to wear a mask its not hard to use common sense even if youre vaccinated Weve had a hospital in my metropolitan area that had 20% of the admitted covid patients fully vaccinated It all depends on when your state started doing vaccines and how long ago it had been since you got yours And we will see a lot more of these so called "breakthrough" cases regardless of vaccination rates And government officials have been warned already of this and the CDC has discussed this internally and a lot of people are concerned about the effectiveness of the vaccines The mask mandate should have never been removed and local governments have also failed their constituents,mrnight8,16278464230,1

Masked 100% in school this fall - no option Its bullshit If you are a family that has a little one then wear your masks If I had a child under 12 my entire family would be masked right now anywhere indoors today - despite currently miniscule numbers However we dont so I dont feel its necessary to do so I wont raise a stink about masking rules that businesses want to put in place but unlike last year when I supported every single one of these mandatesthis year is different,islander1,16278483180,1

h7cw6ro,ovpxdj,The Israeli Prime Minister stated *"We do not know exactly to what degree the vaccine helps[vs Delta] but it is significantly less"* due to a rise in new and serious cases among vaccinated people *"The highest number of coronavirus cases in nearly four months"* It also affects children who are mostly unvaccinated so we need to get them vaccinated perhaps with an updated booster shot before its too late Over half their population is fully vaccinated and among everyone *"around 60% of the patients in serious conditions have been vaccinated Moreover according to Hebrew University researchers who advise the government around 90% of newly infected people over the age of 50 are fully vaccinated"* So the vaccine IS HELPING these statistics PROVE THAT but they also prove that the Delta Variant is not to be taken lightly and that a new vaccine MUST be developed to combat this deadly mutation,Candaianmann,16278533780,1

I get this isnt great for personal liberties (though we use to require people to show immunization records to get into school or enter the country) and we should keep an eye on the government so that things dont stick past the pandemic (like with the NSA and their anti-terrorism measures) but like most people I take this pandemic seriously and just want it to be over I dont believe in forcing people to take the shot with force (unless the virus was more deadly and Martial Law was declared) but restricting them from public places is good encouragement and helps keep immuno-compromised people and others who cant get vaccinated for medical reasons safe,Beeker93,16278566340,1
h7d3s8e,ovpxdj,If you are mad because your freedoms have eroded due to covid then dont blame the scapegoat of the people taking your freedoms Government officials are the people enforcing restrictions If you are vaccinated then you should ask why are they still restricting you and if vaccinated people are at a similiar risk than the unvaccinated then why did those officials lie to you about the effectiveness of the vaccine and then pit you against your fellow citizens,puffdigly,16278571360,1

h7bekdi,ovpxdj,This is going to get downvoted to hell Either the unvaccinated hold-outs change their minds and go get vaccinated (unlikely) or we (the vaccinated) should do our best to help the unvaccinated catch COVID ASAP If they dont die they will have immunity (the hard way); if they die welllets just say the virus has fewer hosts to live off Anyone who is adamant about not taking the vaccine will catch COVID sooner or later Might as well be sooner!

h7bkign,ovpxdj,If Covid had a death rate of under 3% for the US population wouldnt it be reasonable to say that Covids death rate is now under 15% given that half of the population is vaccinated? (lets pretend that age doesnt matter to Covid and the death rate is much less given that most vaccinated people are the older folks that were more likely to be at risk) So why do you care if I get vaccinated or not? My slight chance of dying has no effect on you Why cant we go back to normal why do you insist on wanting everyone to be vaccinated if you are safe? Are you going to ban fast food? High fructose? High sugar? Opioids? Over eating? Those are killers as well and at a much larger scale Why dont you care if Im morbidly obese and at risk of death but care if I can get infected from Covid? I know that the obvious answer will be "you can create a new variant" but think about it The variants we have now have been from all over the world Meaning that unless 100% of the world population is vaccinated with a vaccine that is effective 100% variants will always be a thing So again if you are vaccinated and I choose to be unvaccinated what is stopping us from going back to normal?,trolololoz,16278309140,-4
h7bbsg6,ovpxdj,Throwing money at the situation might be worth it to see if we can increase people getting the vaccine $5000 for every person who has gotten the vaccine would drive a lot of people who havent gotten it to get it Imagine getting $10000 as a married couple That amount of money would swing the pendulum After that if you arent willing to get it than whatever happens to you happens,J_SQUIRREL,16278265820,-2

The vaccine was always said as keeping you alive or out of the hospital not preventing transmission so why restrict what unvaccinated people can do if the risk is the same to each other? I can definitely understand the push to get vaccinated to not overwhelm hospital workers whove been busting ass for so long but they tout it as get vaccinated to end the pandemic unvaccinated people are continuing to extend the pandemic but vaccinated people now do the same thing I think their message is unclear and I think so many mandates that are based of case count is wrong since the vaccine isnt intended to stop transmission it should be off hospitalizations and deaths Thanks to anyone who helps clear this up for me,Quitefrankly27,16298119330,1

gxxxnzl,nb0qrm,I cant tell if this is genius or moronic Part of me thinks they shouldve made it a 1 in 2000 chance to win $1000 (so up to \~5000 people total) But then again the kind of people who are anti-vax or suffer from pandemic indifference might also be the kind to not make decisions based on risk/reward assessment To anyone who has actively chosen to not get a US vaccine or is still"waiting and seeing" can you please tell us what would motivate you more (if you) to get the shots: 1 1 in 2000 chance for $1000 2 1 in 200 chance for $100 3 1 in basically 2 million chance of getting $1m pre-tax I promise to **NOT** bombard or shit talk vaccine hesitant people who choose to respond Would you be more inclined if it was West Virginia style where you get like a $100 or $200 savings bond guaranteed? I feel like we should just offer to pay people to get it This idea that it will deter people due to a perceived increase in personal risk/reward is in my opinion not entirely certain All the news would have to do is explain that every two doses in an arm is estimated to save the economy X # of $ (a fake number say $360) so the govt has decided to share $100 of that savings with end users,DrMarioBrother,16208796520,1

gybc19e,ndkvik,So in the facility I work in (6000+ people) we are allowing for fully vaccinated people to go without masks My company arranged for people to be vaccinated on site and before that arranged for people to get vaccinated offsite We know who the people are that did not or will not get vaccinated mainly because they wont shut up about how much of a hoax it all is This policy change came out after work on Friday Monday is going to be a shit show &#x200B; \*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\*\* TLDR: There was no shit show So Facility management sent out emails reminding people that only those that were fully vaccinated were allowed to have their masks off They also reminded people that they dont want any integrity issues by lying about being vaccinated My field requires a security clearance so a integrity issue could compromise that Walked into work today and the people who were still required to wear a mask wore one I heard minimal griping about the change in policy from the people who were unvaccinated I dont know if any minds were changed about getting the vaccine but Im appreciative that my coworkers are sticking to the mask policy,johnqpublic81,16211648840,2647
gybc0zt,ndkvik,Totally anecdotal and I realize my area might not represent the average American area since we have for the most part been taking covid seriously since the beginning but my state did announce they were changing their mask mandate to reflect the CDC guidelines so we are on the honor system now I was at the mall yesterday and it was pretty busy but literally everyone was wearing a mask still I was honestly shocked since we have good vaccine uptake and over half our adult population fully vaccinated I was expecting to see at least a few The only ones I saw were people sitting at tables and actively eating/drinking and a couple under the nose/chin but its basically no change from before the announcement I just got my 2nd shot so Im not technically fully vaxed yet but I was personally planning to still wear a mask in crowded indoor places like the mall grocery store etc for now until numbers are very low because it just doesnt bother me and its that extra bit of protection Was just surprised to see apparently everyone else feels the same way!,skatinvee,16211648790,578
gybj2i1,ndkvik,I really dont think this ending of mask rules is about trusting americans to do the right thing at all I think its assuming that the anti mask/anti vaxers WONT do the right thing forcing the vaccine hesitant to hurry up and get vaxed and then basically accelerating herd immunity among everyone who wont ever get vaxed its a risky move but at this point sigh i dont really know what else we could do other than keep waiting for something to end thats never going to,master0fcats,16211698360,673
gybqebq,ndkvik,Of course theyll lie the CDC knows that Everyone knows that Not all of us were born yesterday It sucks for those that are incapable of vaccinating but I dont know how else the CDC is supposed to proceed under the assumption that the vaccines are as effective as they are They cant force people to get shots the anti-maskers will continue to refuse shots those that cant get shots but otherwise want them cant get vaccinated and most people that want the shot are getting it They also cant expect masks to work forever just because more people get sick of them by the day Eventually people will just accept the risk like many had already been doing Really there is no way forward for the CDC with the pre-existing guidance which is why the guidance changed The belief that everyone should get vaccinated comes from the desire to eradicate COVID; that ship has sailed as early as last June and we still expect the cows to come back to the barn The cows are gone: COVID is here to stay The CDC finally threw its hands up and said "ok you want to deal with Covid? Fuck it have all the Covid you want If you want to live you know where the vaccine is" Frankly I cant blame them and would probably do the same myself I feel bad for those that cant get the Covid shot for allergies or whatever else but I dont feel bad at all if someone gets sick because they refuse to get the vaccine Now its like any other anti-vaxxor talking point,AyyyGreens,16211740740,119
gybiekq,ndkvik,As a vaccine clinical trial subject masker and "covid is real" person I would say this 1 Those people are going to lie 2 This policy will incentivizes some people 3 There will be some that wont vaccinate or cant vaccinate That will not change with time The only question was when was dropping mask a good point in terms of balancing it out with number of covid cases out there and early enough to incentivize the potential hold outs to impact vaccine numbers (incentive diminishes and covid numbers approaches zero),questionname,16211694170,29

gybt2f5,ndkvik,If all the vaccine does is protect only the recipient from the Viruss effects and everyone else is getting vaccinated then its just personal choice at this point People can choose to weigh the risks and make their own decision Not sure why everyone is obsessed with making others mask up Take your own vaccine and let others deal with the consequences of their own actions Also in Texas and Florida masks are an afterthought and theyve been fine Masks are unnecessary at this point,melange_merchant,16211754760,2

gyd6qgd,ndkvik,Its too early for masks off in public indoors We should wait until 1 There has been enough time for everyone who wants the vaccine to be FULLY vaccinated including in blue areas where appointments have been less available Many age groups have only been recently eligible in some states Also dont forget people without car access need more time 2 At least 50% of the total population is FULLY vaccinated (that means a full 6 weeks after first dose) 3 Ideally until cases are down but if idiots stop us from achieving that this summer we can at least keep masks on until the only people left 12 or older and not FULLY vaccinated are TRULY just the anti-vaxxers 4 The most ideal of all would be for most people to keep wearing masks indoors in public until fall so the 2-11 age group could be included This would also crush the case numbers even more Obviously its fine for fully vaccinated people to have private unmasked indoor parties but in public a lot of lying unmasked people just means that people still waiting for their appointments and partially vaccinated people are now forced to stay at home even more than before or may be in an unsafe environment at work Because other peoples masks protect you more than your own mask And there are definitely going to be some people who stop wearing a mask just because no one else is wearing masks or because someone is harassing them for still wearing a mask,kittey257,16211982160,2

Dont worry about it; you can have as much Covid as you want You already know where the vaccine is if you want to live" I cant say I blame them; Id probably do the same I feel bad for those that cant get the Covid shot for allergies or whatever else but I dont feel bad at all if someone gets sick because they refuse to get the vaccine Its now just like every other anti-vaccination talking point,Hot_Firefighter,16211888960,1

gulj5da,mrcrm8,Im very pro-vaccines and I think this vaccine should be used but I dont get this argument People arent choosing between injecting themselves with the vaccine and injecting themselves with COVID Its not an apples to apples comparison; you have to factor in both the risk of COVID causing a blood clot *and* the risk of getting COVID in the first place In this case the risk of catching COVID would have to be more than 1/8; from what I can tell the total infection rate in the USA is only about 1/10 and for someone whos taking precautions like masking and distancing its almost certainly even less Just accept that theres a slightly elevated risk of blood clots with the vaccine but in most peoples cases the *overall* benefits (both to personal health and to reaching herd immunity so that life can go back to normal) outweigh the risk and anyone whos worried should have a conversation with their own doctor about their personal risk level,etgohomeok,16184900830,4857

Would you still take AZ right away? Depending on your age and risk of infection it *might* actually be better if you didt The question of using AZ is not a non-question or hysteria as some here claim it to be Its a matter of risk assessment In most circumstances the asseseemnt will recommned taking AZ But not in all,bond0815,16184903300,254

gulqr4q,mrcrm8,How come we never heard about blood clots from COVID before the AstraZeneca vaccine came out? Edit: jeez Im not trying to fear monger or suggest to not get vaccinated My point is that studies like this appear to "justify" the blood clots from AstraZeneca and J&J as an acceptable risk for the general population However I think its more important to have a method of identifying who is at risk of getting a blood clot in the first place Of course that would be ideal Maybe then that high risk person should take the Pfizer one instead Especially if its a young person that would likely not get a blood clot from COVID anyway This is a moral dilemma and there will be opinions on both sides,canuckathome,16184942220,-3

gunjngl,mrcrm8,What really fucking annoys me in many of the answers here is *only* comparing blood clot (or rather CVT / "brain clots") risk between Covid and AZ/vaccines Instead of mortality / side effects / long term effects (off both) in general Yes AZ might have a higher risk of CVTs than Pfizer/Biontech and yes it might "only be n times less than the risk of those from Covid"  but Covid can cause death / hospitalization / long term lung or neural damage / "Long Covid" / watever IN ADDITION to blood clots / CVTs And yep even in "the young and healthy" (although with lower probability than in the elderly / other groups at risk  but still quite a bit) Sounds really fucking short-sighted thinking to me Yeah it might be best if everyone would get "the good vaccine" but not everyone can (ask Europe or even better ask "poorer countries) and in really the very most cases even "the bad one" sooner is still much better than getting Covid and dying from blood clots or any of the other many ways it can kill you  or suffering from any of the long term effects On top of that: Getting yourself vaccinated sooner does not only protect your individual sorry corpse it also protects others by reducing potential for further spread (and mutations) and of course protecting those who cannot get vaccinated or whose immune system cannot build as effective an immune response with the vaccine ("vaccine non responders" is the term iirc) What Im saying is: no its not just "AZ clots vs Covid clots vs Biontech clots",spurious_signal,16185227240,1

guotxn9,mrcrm8,There was a good article somewhere about how to assess these risks at a more personal level Like the chances of bad outcomes from these things varies with stuff like age and certain pre-existing conditions along with the general community transmission rates of covid So for this headline here you would need to compare also "what are my chances of getting covid *at all*?" against the choice of vaccine If the chances of getting covid are very very low (maybe you live on an island off NZ or something) then it might make sense to avoid AstraZeneca since in your circumstances your chances of having *any* negative outcome from covid are very very very low compared with a very very low chance of negative outcome from AstraZeneca At the public health level different countries have already taken different reactions based on their particular circumstances For instance if you have a fairly dense population and are high income country and have access to something like the BioNTech vaccine then you might take the approach of abandoning AstraZeneca entirely If you are at the other extreme low income poorly developed health infrastructure lots of people long travel times from population centres you probably will press ahead with AstraZeneca and similar vaccines because of its advantages and accept that you will have some small number of complications or deaths because it is far smaller number of deaths from the much slower more expensive difficult roll out of different vaccines,FartHeadTony,16185472640,1

he17b6p,pts290,As many lives as you might save by forcing people to take the vaccine how many lives does it cost that otherwise would be okay? The intricacies of the vaccine dangers and complex statistics deserve more credit than just "vaccine sideffects are negligible and therefore should be ignored" When you consider that: - the vaccine does not fully prevent infection and transmission and its in question still just how often it breaks through - the % of the population that cant have the vaccine is very small - the % of them who actually catch the virus is small when the R rate is suppressed and cases are driven down - the % of them who get the virus who couldnt have the vaccine who later are hospitalised or die is also very small (though immune suppressive comorbidities do bring this up a little) - variants are likely to be imported from other countries with higher case rates as opposed to arising domestically - in the case of a vaccine-dodging variant youre back to square one anyway You realise thats its a complex issue with many factors and the balance of probability is not clear or indeed not yet known And yes the vaccine does have rare but relevant and potentially lethal side effects https://amptheguardiancom/world/2021/sep/10/boys-more-at-risk-from-pfizer-jab-side-effect-than-covid-suggests-study For the courts to enforce such a mandate with so many factors and limited and disputed evidence in relation to them it seems a little problematic for them to make a judgement call at the cost of peoples bodily autonomy,meluvyouelontime,16324441090,-3

The amount of individuals who would follow a religion that specifically states they can not have a vaccine due to their theological teachings HAS to be minuscule and I personally feel most people saying its a religious reason are liars > Buddhism - Buddhism has no central authority that determines doctrine Vaccination is widely accepted in predominantly Buddhist countries > Christianity - The Christian faith consists of multiple different denominations which may differ in theological approach to vaccines > The following Christian denominations have no theological objection to vaccination: Roman Catholicism Eastern Orthodox Oriental Orthodox Amish Anglican Baptist The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormon) Congregational Episcopalian Jehovahs Witness - Note: This denomination originally denounced vaccination but revised this doctrine in 1952 An article in a recent issue of the churchs newsletter promotes vaccination to avoid infectious diseases Lutheran Mennonite Methodist (including African Methodist Episcopal) Quaker Pentecostal Presbyterian Seventh-Day Adventist Unitarian-Universalist The following denominations do have a theological objection to vaccination: Dutch Reformed Congregations - This denomination has a tradition of declining immunizations Some members decline vaccination on the basis that it interferes with divine providence However others within the faith accept immunization as a gift from God to be used with gratitude Faith healing denominations including: Faith Tabernacle Church of the First Born Faith Assembly End Time Ministries Church of Christ Scientist - One of the basic teachings of this denomination is that disease can be cured or prevented by focused prayer and members will often request exemptions when available However there are not strict rules against vaccination and members can receive required vaccinations > Hinduism - Hinduism has no prohibition against vaccines While Hindus venerate cows trace bovine components of certain vaccines have not been identified as a theological concern > Islam - Islam has no prohibition to vaccination There have been several gatherings of Muslim leaders scholars and philosophers to address the theological implications of ingredients in food and drugs including vaccination The Organization of Islamic Conference and 15th annual conference of the International Fiqh Council both concluded that vaccination is acceptable under Islam The Islamic Organization for Medical Sciences concluded that porcine gelatin used in vaccines is acceptable Some muftis (experts in Islamic law) hold that immunization is obligatory (wajib) when the disease risk is high and the vaccine has benefits that far outweigh its risk > Jainism - Jains follow a path of non-violence toward all living beings including microscopic organisms Jains do allow cooking the use of soap and antibiotics and vaccination because this destruction of microorganisms even though regretted is necessary to protect other lives > Judaism - Judaism supports vaccination as an action to maintain health and also as a parental responsibility to protect children against future infection In Judaism the concept of Pikuakh nefesh acting to save ones own or anothers life is a primary value While some vaccines containing porcine derived gelatin Jewish scholars agree that porcine gelatin in injectable form is acceptable > Scientology: in an interview for BeliefNet Rev John Carmichael of the Church of Scientology stated that there are no precepts or strictures about vaccinations within Scientology https://wwwvumcorg/health-wellness/news-resource-articles/immunizations-and-religion,cats_catz_kats_katz,16300867500,83

hcbmg0z,pl59ch,Its unfortunate sad almost pathetic that it takes a mandate to get the rest of our country vaccinated In the beginning of the vaccine roll out people were line jumping etc to get that shot; as it rolled out and the oppositional became more vocal we had to incentivize it with millionaire contests and outright paying people to get the vaccine Its pathetic that this idiot pandemic has gone on so longthe reason it is still with us is that not everyone is getting vaccinated so the virus is continuing to spread and its mutating Do we want to still be dealing with this virus next year also???? Im really sick of it Especially the disappointment that my family and I got our two doses of Pfizer shot and because of everything else we cant feel 100% safe from Covid Weve done our part and gotten vaccinatedcan barely wait to get a third doseand still read that vaccinated people die from this stupid virus! Regardless of your personal feelings its a public health crisisthere are way too many news articles about dying unvaccinated people saying they wish theyd gotten vaccinated Even if you think its stupid get it and be a hero for the greater good I think another worry is Bidens mental stateas in is he mentally competent?

hc8f8x0,pl59ch,Pros: More vaccinated = fewer hospitals overloaded Cons: more people quitting jobs to avoid the vaccine While the increased vaccination rate should slow the spread and decrease the number of hospitalizations thereby decreasing the unsustainable load on our failing healthcare system this move may also trigger a wave of resignations from the workforce at a time when labor is already in short supply Diregarding for a moment the arguments around freedom of choice and the role of government in our lives the question is: will this mandate have a net positive effect on our society? Does the anticipated decrease in hospitalizations outweigh the potential decrease in the labor force? Consider also the compounding effects of a labor shortage ( yes I know its actually a wage shortage) on the already fractured supply chain Additionally how much benefit will we actually see from this mandate if (when) a vaccine resistant variant of covid begins to dominate?

The answer is yes The scientific community has spoken and weve had a general consensus about the validity and effectiveness of vaccines for decades Yes with anything medically related there are always risks involved but anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers are being completely disingenuous about those risks Millions and millions of people for decades have taken all sorts of vaccinations and lived side-effect free Vaccines have been mandatory for things like public schools for **decades** Censoring this type of bullshit content isnt an indicator that were living in this liberal dystopian future that a good amount of these anti-vaxxers seem to think were living in Its basically tantamount to removing those videos where idiots were dying from eating those detergent pods Weve 100% reached a point were we know that anti-vaccine beliefs are wrong Enabling people to continue to put out factually misleading content about vaccines is basically like promoting that drinking bleach is good for you This type of censorship whether you believe it or not is 100% for the greater good Anti-vaxxers are wrong If you believe that vaccines are some sort of liberal conspiracy perpetrated by the deep state lizard people you should be in a mental institution I ultimately feel bad for everyone who has fallen pray to bullshit conspiracy theories and are the victims of a poor public education system but now the health and wellbeing of my family and myself are at risk and its time to put an end to these dangerous beliefs Take away their ability to communicate with the masses and allow them to find some niche piece of the internet where they can be in their echo chamber in peace without risking spreading their misinformation to the rest of us,chadstark89,16329392940,-1

Is it "anti-vaccine misinformation" to question whether someone who has previously been infected with SARS-COV-2 and carries antibodies really needs to be vaccinated? How about questioning whether 20 year olds should be mandated to get the vaccine? Are there clearly-defined guidelines for who and what is banned?

gzvm272,nniy3y,I work for a hospital system and we have been discussing this from the very beginning This guidance from the EEOC makes mandates possible for employers to require the vaccine It removes the legal challenge hurdles that employees could bring if an employer mandates a vaccine with an emergency approval from the FDA (which isnt full drug authorization and not fully tested) However because of the number of vaccinations in the US Pfizer is in process of requesting full FDA authorization By the EEOC making this action it ramps up the timeline making it possible for employers to take action now instead of 3-4 months later this summer/fall when we may see increases I infection rates TLDR - this moves up the timeline for employers to make vaccinations mandatory improving vaccination rates and protecting more people especially those who cannot get the vaccine (immuno-compromised and those under 12),tumbleweedcowboy,16223012420,1

gzw0xq0,nniy3y,Not necessarily employers but heres a fun read about this type of stuff Real Life Example: Massachusetts Mandates A Vaccine In Jacobson v Massachusetts (1905) Mr Jacobsen refused to obey a law requiring that everyone in Cambridge receive a smallpox vaccination At the time a smallpox epidemic was raging Jacobson faced a fine or imprisonment if he failed to take the vaccine Jacobsen argued that forcing him to get the vaccine violated his fundamental liberty which included freedom to control his own body The State argued that the health risk was urgent that widespread vaccination was needed to protect everyone against smallpox and that any harm to individual liberty was a price worth paying given the severe threat of smallpox The Supreme Court acknowledged that both sides had a point On one hand the Court noted that "when faced with a society-threatening epidemic a state may implement emergency measures that curtail constitutional rights so long as the measures have at least some "real or substantial relation" to the public health crisis "On the other hand the Court recognized Jacobsens argument and agreed that the vaccine order did impact liberty and personal freedom The court cautioned that "a law purporting to protect public health may nevertheless be invalid if it "has no real or substantial relation to those objects or is beyond all question a plain palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law" In short while the court balanced the two competing concernsliberty and public safetythe court came down squarely in favor of public safety holding the vaccine order was valid given the seriousness of the threat The Court said that "the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States does not import an absolute right in each person to be at all times and in all circumstances wholly freed from restraint" But the Court also warned that any if a law goes too far in restricting liberty if the law is in place for too long or reaches too far or if the goal of the law can be achieved by less invasive measures then the court may well strike down the law,LazyKidd420,16223088990,1

hc3japj,pkaf14,This post had been locked as the comments are veering off topic - we hear you loud and clear folks Joe is not a scientist! The article is fact checking one of Joe Rogans claims about "leaky" vaccines Andrew Read is a professor of biology and entomology at Pennsylvania State His 2015 vaccine study was misrepresented by Joe Rogan and has since gone viral Directly from the [above article](https://wwwforbescom/sites/andreamorris/2021/08/08/joe-rogan-is-getting-this-completely-wrong-says-the-scientist-who-conducted-the-vaccine-study/) by Andrea Morris: "Are mRNA vaccines leaky? Rogan seems to think that mRNA vaccines are quite leaky because of breakthrough infections Read points out that no vaccine is 100% effective Although we still need more data to determine how leaky they are the rate of breakthrough infections in vaccinated people remains statistically low enough to consider the mRNA vaccines highly effective at preventing infection "We dont know at the moment how leaky these things are Its conceivable that they are actually close to non-leaky Im amazed how good these mRNA vaccines are Theyre incredibly good" Reads very concerned that misrepresentation of his research is causing vaccine hesitancy",adotmatrix,16311303710,1

htbl27l,s6wzbk,The reality is that vaccine refusal is not related to personal research or talking to your doctor or the contents/origins efficacy etc It is a purely emotional and mostly political response Uniformed by choice and insufficiently educated people made a critical life choice based on flawed information and rather than admit being wrong they usually double down on their position Viruses are expert mutators As we have seen There is a good chance infected people could generate a new mutation that could kill off the human race People who make decisions not to get vaccinated in the face of all the available unbiased information do not deserve our sympathy They are dangers to society and truly deserve our scorn,witzed1,16426028180,1

hb1o56y,pf4633,Moderna Incs Covid vaccine generated more than double the antibodies of a similar shot made by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE in research directly comparing immune responses to the inoculations A study of almost 2500 workers at a major Belgium hospital system found antibody levels among individuals who hadnt been infected with the coronavirus before getting two doses of the Moderna vaccine averaged 2881 units per milliliter compared with 1108 units/mL in an equivalent group who got two jabs of the Pfizer shot The results published Monday in a letter to the Journal of the American Medical Association suggested the differences might be explained by the: higher amount of active ingredient in the Moderna vaccine -- 100 micrograms versus 30 micrograms in Pfizer-BioNTech longer interval between doses of the Moderna vaccine -- four weeks versus three weeks for Pfizer-BioNTech Modernas vaccine was associated with a two-fold risk reduction against breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to Pfizers in a review of people in the Mayo Clinic Health System in the US from January to July The results were reported in a separate study released ahead of publication and peer review on Aug 9,actualtext,16304105170,2894

hb4k07s,pf4633,The companies or government should be identifying the pros and cons of each vaccine and then marketing them based on those qualities For example 90% of the anti-vaxxers tell me they dont want to "take the vaccine" because mRNA technology hasnt been tested in humans and we dont yet know if it is safe I can actually understand their concern even though I disagree So I ask them "why havent you taken the Johnson & Johnson vaccine then?"

hb2u4gv,pf4633,So basically This means nothing One hospital It says those that werent exposed but i dont believe we can know that for sure Small sample Large sample size over several sites Also what does this mean in hispanic/black/asian? What is acceptable line for antibodies? What is rate of decline? For example if you need 50 antibodies per nanoliter to be effective but pfizer gives 500 and moderna 990 then its moot If on day 14 pfizer is 400 and moderna is 600 then on day 60 pfizer is200 and moderna is 202 And so on Thats why hospitizations and death are good clinical outcomes Both vaccines work great Period Otherwise you would see huge jumps in hospitalizations from the pfizer group Honestly out of the 8000 or so hospitalized or dead and completely vaccinated how many are moderna vs pfizer? Also 75% of those are 65 and up So that means they were more likely to get pfizer before moderna was approved So even then you would have to account for accessibility Studies like this dont really help except to get researchers more funding,justjoshingu,16304292650,6

h977pfc,p5gzct,Out of curiosity is this intended to stop unvaccinated people from going out more? As I understand it being vaccinated does not necessarily stop you from catching or spreading but reduces the severity of the symptoms My wife and I are both fully vaccinated and think everyone who can should do so as well But Im not sure if this will help as much as people think I feel the proof of vaccine needs to come from places of business (peoples jobs) and the likes Essentially where your employment is tied to but only once its FDA approved which should be soon from what Ive read Forcing proof of vaccination to go out and dine is likely to cause an uproar and make those who are resisting to fight back even more And do we really think its fair to put that burden of upholding these rules on restaurants and the like? Should hostesses and waiters/waitresses have to be responsible for these things? I dont think thats fair or right,lukelnk,16291443760,-1

hmtyfsz,r6ejmd,Evidence? The vaccine was designed for a very specific spike protein The spike protein of Omicron is different from that specific protein by 32 mutations! It is like asking a private investigator - the PI is the bodys immune system in this analogy - to find a person but youre giving the PI a photo not of the said person but of another similar-looking person The effort can only be less effective But it remains to be seen exactly how much of a degradation there will be in effectiveness,OliveOliveo,16383860970,6

hmsmq4x,r6ejmd,Regardless anyones best bet is to probably take the booster and check out again for another 6 months while obviously practicing common sense around others I take back what I said a few days ago about Omicron potentially being the big one for all but it will probably just be the case for those fully unvaccinated and who have trusted in their bodys natural immunity since March 2020 EDIT: 6 months off Covid news I mean It feels as if were reaching the point where its just a game of keeping up with whatever is the most effective vaccine every 6 months or so unless something comes around and messes things up 6 months of course would be nice but its definitely a dream Just simple Covid news not time off lol,Sn1pe,16383664860,-9

hmzsxv2,r6ejmd,No evidence? So the research scientists saying that some of the mutations on the spike protein are concerning because it could make it easier for it to evade what the vaccine is supposed to do are just off their rocker right? This stupid virus keeps mutating because its still so prevalent almost everywhere and the longer it sticks around the more it will mutate itself to evade the vaccine until finally the vaccine just will be useless and not work at all That appears to be what it is already trying to do!,jen7677,16384856830,1

hrd2jhz,rwn229,You know whats really amazing? That I believe were performing WORSE right now than we were a year ago I currently have congestion and a cough Ive had it for over a week now; thought it was a cold but its not going away I decided "I should probably get tested" I found a take-home test for $15 at the grocery store - used it and it came up negative I figured "maybe I should get a professional consult just to make sure" Guess what? minimal 1 week wait time for any place within 50 miles of me Drive-through tests? "Oh no thats for asymptomatic only you have to go to the regular places" All appointments full Get an at-home test? Sold out everywhere Order one online? One week+ estimated timeframe IT WAS EASIER TO GET A VACCINE INJECTED IN MY ARM THAN TO GET A SWAB AND SEE IF IM INFECTED How the hell does that happen? How could we have been THIS UNPREPARED when were going on YEAR 3 OF A PANDEMIC??? I shouldnt be this stunned but yet I cant believe how mismanaged all of this was even with a seemingly "competent" Government back in command Did they all collectively get-together and just say "fuck it business as usual" and forgot to announce that? **EDIT**: Just an FYI I live in Central New York around the Syracuse area and things are generally managed well (we get a LOT of snow and its usually plowed within a reasonable amount of time so they know how to handle these types of issues) The fact that its this bad here makes me feel bad for the States/Counties that REALLY didnt lift a finger and try to help Our local Government officials are doing what they can but its nowhere near enough to stem the tide of Omicron Nobody was prepared and nobody TRIED to get prepared Complete failures all-around,VheloGrace,16413960850,560
hrdbk3d,rwn229,Im not sure what to make of these numbers Deaths are less than half the last wave Check the data for yourself HALF https://wwwnytimescom/interactive/2021/us/massachusetts-covid-caseshtml Now Im sure ICUs are preventing more deaths than they did last year but cases are double their peak yet half the deaths? Vaccines are working So honestly the death data leads me to believe there are waaaaay less people in the ICU vs last year Not sure Im buying these drama headlines or why the hospitals are struggling this year vs last And Mass general on their own website stated they have ICU capacity as of 12/24 https://datargjcom/covid-19-hospital-capacity/facility/massachusetts-general-hospital/220071/ Now Im sure the holiday surge probably pushed those numbers up but look at last year the same time frame They had 157 ICU beds last Christmas They now have 147 Theyve lost 9% of their beds (probably due to staff having Covid) But that isnt exactly a crisis and they still appear to have capacity But just saying do the research for yourself and come to your own conclusions Then again its Reddit and no one gives a $&@% A sensationalistic headline gets way more clicks even if the article is offering alternative facts and people have an attention span of an ant So who cares right? Im gonna save this mass general link so I can check the data for next week Not reaching a conclusion yet but based on this data Im leaning towards "yes this is a problem but its not the end of the world crisis the internet makes you believe" EDIT: and honestly the EMT post below was asking who to blame? Look at the Mass General link and how much capacity they had last Nov they over shot offering 210+ beds Operating at half capacity is not profitable for the hospital so it makes sense they would scale down and run at capacity If youre looking for someone to blame clearly this is hospital managements problem Theyve underestimated the demand for ICU beds and werent able to scale up fast enough Granted this is an extremely difficult thing to predict Who knew right? But this in essence is where the problem lies The inability of hospitals to accurately predict the demand for ICU beds 2 months ahead and scale capacity accordingly,888Kraken888,16413995890,27

Let kids get vaccinated and call it good Make schools require the vaccine to attend and let it be done,_________FU_________,16274944550,73
h6u68z2,ot7vtq,So the CDC "confirmed" that vaccinated people "may" be infectiouswhat is this? Come back when there is some actual data Data - even with the Delta variant - vaccinated people are hospitalized at a rate of 0003% The answer is not to make people "mask up" again - the answer is to get the idiots refusing vaccines to take the vaccine The vaccines are VERY effective The unvaccinated people are the same people who dont wear masks Mandating masks at this point would only protect the RARE case of vaccinated to unvaccinated contagion Instead of focusing on vaccinated infectiousness - focus on getting the unvaccinated to take the dang vaccine,sadpanda___,16274847280,107
h6tx6wk,ot7vtq,This wont help anything relative to getting the unvaccinated to get vaccinated The unvaccinated dont read further into the details to understand the vaccine get still get you infected but it will help in avoided serious illness/hospitalization/death All they will read is"Vaccinated still can transmit the virus" and run with it to the hills screaming "I told you so!",HumbleBJJ,16274807310,53
h6vr0d4,ot7vtq,I dont follow the logic If viral loads in vaccinated people with Delta may be infections **vaccines** are necessary Im not spending the rest of my life wearing a mask to protect anti-vaxxers and conspiracy nuts since it seems they will always be vulnerable to a resurgence of the virus due to their own irresponsibility and lack of foresight,Bacontoad,16275084670,13
h6ugq0b,ot7vtq,So what vaccinated people are expected to take care of unvaccinated people for whatforever people who have not gotten the vaccine are the ones who have the burden of protecting themselves I dont have to worry about them The vaccine is available to all It took me 20 minutes to get each shot My city even reimburses you if you take public transit to get it People are making the wrong choice But let them They are putting themselves at risk If you got either of the MRNA vaccines you are good At worst you get covid and its a mild cold I dont understand the obsession with restrictions With the vaccine we will never get to a point where our Healthcare system will be overwhelmed and furthermore all the dems shouting about restrictions are the same ones making sure Healthcare is not a right in this country How about improving our health system to handle a higher caseload and making sure everyone has Healthcare instead if creating social restrictions Its all nonsense and so hypocritical We have had over a year to work on our health care system and guess what the people in power are not just not doing anything they are not not even having the discussion With the current system we have EVERYONE is at risk of going bankrupt over a small ailment There are a million risks every American everyday encounters that could put them right into our inadequate Healthcare system Mask restrictions arent going to make Healthcare more accessible and that is what we actually need,crankycrassus,16274890970,77

h6u0kwv,ot7vtq,My question is since transmission is happening in all cases how is this pressuring the evolution of the virus to create new variations? Are we going to see a crazy deadly variation due to the vaccine? Im not educated in this field of thought in any way Seems we have very interesting dynamics all over the world with many different scenarios Vax a b c dsome population % Vax some population % not Vax and many people moving around the planet 24/7 I dont think there is a solution other than treatments,Fatherof10,16274822630,3

h6vbjny,ot7vtq,Sorry but this is stupid The entire point of the vaccine is to move on with life Why are we suddenly so concerned with masks in a post vaccinated world? The Flu vaccine CERTAINLY never saw 70% vax rates is about half as effective as the COVID vaccine is(including against delta) and we never concerned ourselves with masks prior to COVID What is the deal?

h6u18nl,ot7vtq,So im sure ill get some heat for this but just because I dont fully trust a vaccine yet does not mean im a Anti-vaxxer and im sure a lot of people feel the same Now just because im not vaccinated doesnt mean im out here in the public not wearing masks and acting like everything is sunshine and rainbows actually the opposite I stay home hardly go anywhere at all when I do its to get groceries and wearing a mask And i have done this since the pandemic started &#x200B; My point is Some unvaccinated people are refusing to get vaccinated for all different reasons a lot of us dont care for the political aspect here some of us actually dont trust a vaccine because who is to say they are not lying about what they do or the numbers I mean we have been lied too about everything else and now im supposed to just trust them? The US government totally fucked us all here and now we the people are being even further divided with the spin of "the unvaccinated is the reason for the current wave" &#x200B; This pandemic should of had us unite as people and help our neighbor and unite as one to overcome this instead the exact opposite its depressing I wish we had actual leaders lead instead of what we have &#x200B; Any who rant over enjoy yall day!,willg7607,16274825560,8

h6vdbuu,ot7vtq,I dont understand this at all 9999% of vaccinated people have not gotten the virus after being vaccinated (This number isnt arbitrary out of 160 million people vaccinated 6000 have gotten COVID) so why care about unvaccinated people?

h6v57tl,ot7vtq,Im so confused as to why people thought they could not wear a mask when being vaccinated? The CDC had been saying from the beginning to wear a mask regardless of vaccination status It was the local governments that said you dont have to wear a mask if youre vaccinated It wasnt the CDC that said that If you use the Wayback Machine on the CDCs website I chose a random date 8 April 2021 It literally says word for word >After youve been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 you should keep taking precautionslike wearing a mask staying 6 feet apart from others and avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces https://webarchiveorg/web/20210408055011/https://wwwcdcgov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinatedhtml,Mookie_Merkk,16274992070,-1

h6txcsv,ot7vtq,Somebody enlighten me here: If the viral load is the same between vaccinated and unvaccinated but if you are vaccinated you dont get sick where are those viruses produced? Dont you get sick because of the damage the virus replication does in your body (the cells it targets for replication the effects of the virus capsids around in the bloodstream etc) so if you get the same viral load in the end how are those generated without symptoms in the unvaccinated? Does the vaccine magically redirect production to areas that the body is cool with? Unless the definition of viral load has changed I really cant wrap my head around the biology here Or unless the Delta Variant outperforms the common cold in terms of adaptation to the human body and it manages to spread without a cough or a sneeze,9w9,16274808060,1

hcyi4pm,poqczw,My dad had a heart attack two weeks ago and was transferred to three different hospitals because the ERs were overrun with unvaccinated COVID patients He spent almost 24 hours in the third ER in an open room with three very sick COVID patients while they were all waiting for rooms/procedures Thankfully he was able to get his stent procedure and an actual room before anything serious happened but it was an incredibly scary and frustrating two days for him and my family Also super thankful his and my moms Pfizer vaccines and masks worked and both are still negative for COVID almost two weeks later,jeninchicago,16317183860,1800

gwja6gl,n2hns4,**Michigan is now hospitalizing more people under 40 than those over 80 for COVID-19** Dr Stacey Sensor says her 18-year-old son a high school senior is "one of the healthiest people I know" "He works out every single day at five oclock in the morning" said Sensor a Gaylord physician "He takes all these supplements He only eats healthy And he got COVID at the gym "He was quite sick for about eight days" she said "So Im telling you that it doesnt matter what supplements you take what your age is Even in the healthiest individual they still can get it and they can still become very sick and then the effects can be there for quite some time" Its a cautionary tale she said for people who see COVID-19 as a serious health threat for the elderly but a much more benign illness for younger healthier people In fact Michigans current coronavirus surge has turned that assumption on its head: Last week the state was averaging more hospital admissions for COVID patients under 40 than patients age 80 or older The former was about 78 a day compared to 50 for the latter according to data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services The biggest reason for the demographic shift experts say: The difference in vaccination rates About 74% of Michigan residents age 70 and older have gotten at least one dose of vaccine and two-thirds are fully vaccinated For those 16 to 49 the numbers are 36% who have gotten one dose and 23% fully immunized; there is no vaccine authorized for children under 16 Also contributing to the surge of virus among young people is the spread of variants that are both more contagious and more lethal; the tendency of many younger adults to disregard COVID-19 guidelines and the fact that schools have reopened "Its definitely become more of a young person disease now probably because they havent been vaccinated and theyve been more likely than older folks to go out and about be in close contact with others and go to gatherings" said Dr Mark Hamed a physician who is medical director for Huron Lapeer Sanilac Tuscola Alcona Iosco Ogemaw and Oscoda counties The numbers bear that out In the first year of the pandemic Michigan residents age 60 and older accounted for 23% of cases; its now 13% Conversely those under age 20 accounted for 13% of cases during the first 12 months of the pandemic; its now 25% The chart below shows the April case numbers by age group compared to the monthly average through March 2021 as well as compared to December 2020 during the fall surge [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/WNTiwqVd1gGfPM09p2D0qzVgFZY=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/VQGMMSPTZNGADOVJQPKGAWILMQPNG) In theory thats actually a welcomed shift from the standpoint that old age is easily the biggest risk factor for being hospitalized or dying of COVID-19 But experts have been taken aback by the spike in COVID-19 hospitalizations among younger adults and children Compared to the height of the fall surge in early December Michigans average daily hospitalization admissions for COVID-19 are up 33% for those age 18 to 29 58% for thirty-somethings and 64% for those in their 40s Meanwhile hospitalizations for those age 80 and older are down 60% compared to December [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/86v1e7Apdm4-zWbHd-9Q7X4rAh0=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/RPEUG3IW5JGXTF6HQYL2RBK67Upng) "Its like you take what we were seeing before and shift it down by one or two decades" said Dr Joel Fishbain an infectious disease specialist for Beaumont Hospital in Grosse Pointe "Weve got 20-year-olds who are getting admitted and 30-year-olds requiring oxygen which we never saw before and needing as much treatment as we can give them Weve got 40- and 50-year-olds ending up on ventilators" Pediatric cases also are up Last week the state was averaging almost 10 hospital admissions a day among pediatric patients with COVID-19 triple the number in mid-February Deaths among children and younger adults have spiked too In the first 13 months of the pandemic there were six deaths among children ages 10 to 19 In the past month four deaths were reported Another 65 deaths were reported in April for 20- and 30-somethings quadruple the monthly average The chart below compares April deaths to the monthly average through March 2021 as well as to confirmed COVID deaths in December The numbers show how deaths among seniors plummeted in April compared to December as a result of vaccinations while coronavirus variants spiked deaths among unvaccinated people under age 50 [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/caQyJGE9C2BiswUM2ThU22RJumk=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/ZXCIGC7VWZCN7H65ULFSFE4GPIPNG) Deaths and hospitalizations arent the only concern While most COVID patients under age 50 "dont get severely ill there are a growing number of people who have long-haul COVID symptoms" said Dr Liam Sullivan an infectious disease specialists with Spectrum Health in Grand Rapids "They have problems with smelling with taste with concentration with memory with fatigue with night sweats "So even though they had a mild illness the first time around theyre still dealing with these things month and months later and thats not something you want to deal with when youre 25 or 35" he said "Of course you dont want to deal with it at any age but especially when youre in the prime of your life" And for women the research is growing on the dangers of COVID-19 during pregnancy Dr Kurt Wharton an Oakland County obstetrician currently has four pregnant patients in intensive care units battling COVID-19 All four are "fighting for their lives" said Wharton who works at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak While COVID-19-related deaths among pregnant women remain very rare Wharton and others say the evidence is growing that coronavirus during pregnancy can put a woman at a much higher risk of preterm birth preeclampsia and admission to the ICU and/or intubation especially if the woman has pre-existing conditions such as high blood pressure obesity diabetes or heart disease Evidence growing on COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy: Virus is dangerous; the shots are not Doctors offer several theories on why more younger people are getting significantly ill with COVID-19 in the current surge One is the spread of variants which are both more contagious and more lethal The variants are "stickier" Hamed said which means it takes less exposure to make someone severely ill or even symptomatic Wharton noted the same pattern happened during the 1918 influenza pandemic The initial surge in the spring of 1918 primarily impacted the elderly and babies But the virus mutated and came roaring back in the fall of 1918 and its primary victims during that surge were younger adults "History is repeating itself" Wharton said Another issue suggests Hamed and others: More unvaccinated people are gathering in groups without masks That increases the risk of exposure to a higher viral load which has been associated with more severe disease "The best mask you wear the less viral load you inhale" Wharton said On top that many schools have reopened and children and younger adults in particular are resuming their pre-pandemic social lives "You can see it" Wharton said "Younger people are all out in groups again walking down sidewalks shopping going to restaurants and bars together They just think theyre invulnerable" The good news is that COVID-19 vaccinations have proven "wildly successful" in significantly reducing the chances of getting the virus and spreading to others Sullivan said And just as vaccinations have blunted spread of the virus among senior citizens the spread of COVID among younger adults can be stymied through immunization shots Vaccination programs "really need to target the younger people right now" Sensor said "Theyre the ones who are getting sick Weve done a really good job of vaccinating our older population but to really move forward and get out of this pandemic we really need our younger people to step up to the plate and get the vaccine to protect themselves and protect their families",itsdr00,16198732450,154

gwksrs6,n2hns4,Its the same pattern as with Israel during its vaccine rollout The overall numbers decreased as the Israeli government expanded the vaccine among all eligible age groups but the younger ones numbers increased until they got vaccinated My GUESS is that its behavior-related when mixing vaccinated vs unvaccinated Sounds like most breakthroughs are asymptotic or low symptomatic If people are letting their guard down around an unknowingly asymptomatic vaccinated parent or grand parent (for example) the bump in infection rate in the younger population makes sense Edited for typos,sunqueen73,16198981410,1

h9pnz04,p8e6s6,"The Food and Drug Administration is pushing to approve Pfizer-BioNTechs two-dose Covid-19 vaccine on Monday further expediting an earlier timeline for licensing the shot according to people familiar with the agencys planning Regulators were working to finish the process by Friday but were still working through a substantial amount of paperwork and negotiation with the company The people familiar with the planning who were not authorized to speak publicly about it cautioned that the approval might slide beyond Monday if some components of the review need more time An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment The agency had recently set an unofficial deadline for approval of around Labor Day The approval is expected to pave the way for a series of vaccination requirements by public and private organizations who were awaiting firmer regulatory backing before implementing mandates Federal and state health officials are also hoping that an approved vaccine will draw interest from some Americans who have been hesitant to take one that was only authorized for emergency use a phenomenon suggested by recent polling Some universities and hospitals are expected to mandate inoculation once a vaccine is fully approved The Pentagon earlier this month said it plans to make Covid vaccinations mandatory for the countrys 13 million active-duty troops "no later" than the middle of next month or sooner if the FDA acts earlier The timing of the approval could result in an uncomfortable messaging problem for the Biden administration which on Wednesday announced that fully vaccinated people should prepare to get booster shots eight months after they received second doses Approving the vaccine and encouraging boosters at the same time may suggest to some that the vaccine as licensed is inadequate without an extra shot The FDA last week updated its authorizations of Pfizer-BioNTechs and Modernas vaccine to allow third doses for some immunocompromised people a decision backed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Regulators are still reviewing Modernas application for full approval for its coronavirus vaccine and a decision could come at least several weeks after the one for Pfizer-BioNTech",urbanpencil,16294944330,203

gwysdn4,n4uoij,Probably going to be downvoted for saying this but here are my reasons for being in the "unlikely" camp I want to get it the vaccine so Im curious if anyone can actually refute some of these points: Restrictions have become a moral question with easing restrictions being seen as evil and more restrictions good Seeing peoples reactions to people in this thread saying they want restrictions eased is proof of that Theres no point to getting vaccinated if well have to wear masks attend online school and have businesses shut down/otherwise crippled indefinitely The side effects and no Im not talking about the fringe cases of people dying etc I trust it enough that Im not worried about them Theres just no time in my world to feel like I got hit by an electric streetcar for upwards of a week Im a college student and accommodations made to people down for the count from the immediate side effects highly depend on the professor There will be no accommodations for me Reduced availability from the J&J freeze I had originally intended to take the J&J vaccine to minimize the effect of the previous point but after the freeze it became and continues to be incredibly difficult in my area to get Cost This is a simple one but there are likely to be negative financial repercussions for getting it ie having to pay for it Lack of a positive incentive As a college student I didnt receive any stimulus checks that went out earlier this and last year There might be a reason to get it if there was an incentive to doing so in a similar manner I would actually receive but I see no movement on that The effectiveness time per vaccine Ive heard estimates putting the time of effectiveness as low as 3-6 months depending on the variant Given all these other factors the fact that I would have to take this 4x a year in perpetuity makes this sound about as futile as it gets Those are the big ones and I dont really see any of them changing any time soon at least in my area Open to new information/having my mind changed I really do see the positives in getting it but until these roadblocks are gone it remains unlikely I will,BTSInDarkness,16201726700,4

gud12o7,mpzwzj,For those upset about this the FDA needs time to investigate to ensure safety We dont know exactly how widespread it could be Even if it isnt that much they need time to figure out who is at risk and who is not This isnt a removal of approval its a pause Can you imagine the reaction if they ignored it and didnt try to do anything about it?

gucwuqj,mpzwzj,Okay heres what the article says Out of the roughly 7 million people who have received the J&J vaccine 6 (yes 6) have developed a rare disorder involving blood clots All 6 cases were women in the age range of 18 to 48 One died and another is currently in the hospital Its again one of those out of abundance of caution situations but this is not remotely wide spread or anything The 6 out of 7 million means 0000857% of vaccine recipients developed these blood clots,visual-curve,16183124380,298

guezf0f,mpzwzj,I believe this is caution that is unwarranted and dangerous What is less likely to kill you a blood clot 1 in 1250000 or corona virus?

gufn854,mpzwzj,US still seeing over 20-30 times the daily deaths and cases compared to the UK is a bit weird (all schools reopened in UK for three weeks before Easter) UK did start with Pfizer for the eldest patients in early December but then early January had a huge rollout of AZ vaccine with a change of strategy to 1-shot prioritisation (so delaying second shot to 12 weeks) And so far it seems to have worked amazingly well There are the 1 in a million fatal blood clot reports in UK from AZ too but the early hysteria about anaphylactic reactions to the Pfizer doses has disappeared for some reason (its much more common than blood clots) (They let you leave the vaccination room straight away after AZ jab with Pfizer you have to wait at 15-30 mins before you are allowed to leave because of this issue),escherbach,16183605030,3

gud99bg,mpzwzj,I dont think that pausing the J&J vaccine is an overreaction this is normal and what the FDA and CDC are supposed to do But I do think they should have been better prepared for how to handle this Because now the media headlines are just "FDA and CDC are suspending the vaccine out of clot fears" which fails to fully represent the situation They absolutely should have been more prepared to better handle these rare or one-off instances,perderickhapley,16183202680,7
gufb9d0,mpzwzj,Although I understand the concern its very possible this is a statistically normal phenomenon Heres some math to consider: The incidence of clots in women on oral contraceptives is 03%-1% over 10 years There are about 65 million women age 18-50 in the US About 14% are on the pill That means at the high end of the range you could expect 24 women per day could get a clot (ie 9000000\*001/3650 = 24) If we assume the distribution of the JnJ vaccine wasnt demographically biased (which may not be the case but the data on it should be available) then 7000000\*65000000/330000000\*014 = 193000 were women age 18-48 on oral contraceptives This is about 214% of all women in that demographic So over the course of a month you would expect those women to be responsible for 00214\*24\*30 = 154 clots at the high end of the normal risk range and 46 at the low end of the range The actual reported number was 6 Even assuming 50% reporting this is well within the normal range And that doesnt even account for pregnant women who also have an increased risk of clots Running the numbers for 54 million pregnant women (at any given time) each with a 01% chance of developing a clot Therefore on any given day you could expect 5400000\*0001/280 = 193 pregnant women to experience a clot or 580 in the course of a month Now granted pregnant women may have been less likely to get the vaccine (although its reportedly safe during pregnancy) BUT lets ignore that potential bias for a minute and assume that 5400000/330000000\*7000000 = 115000 pregnant women got the vaccine in the last month Those women would be responsible for 115000/5400000\*580 = 124 additional clots over the course of that month So under totally regular circumstances it wouldnt be abnormal for 27 out of the 3500000 women in question to get a clot in a given month This leaves a lot of room for the potential effect of biases in these stats Its obviously critical to verify all this though so I understand why the CDC would want to shut things down while they delve into the data Hindsight is 20/20 but I would say its really not surprising this was the main adverse event that was reported Women age 18-48 have a very very low rate of sudden unexpected mortality due to an adverse clinical event Even though the survival rate for a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is 95% that 5% is a significant number for individuals who are otherwise totally healthy Id be willing to bet its one of the top sudden physiological causes of mortality in the demographic in question Glancing at the data for the AstraZeneca vaccine it seems very similar Im curious -- have no patients who got the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines experienced clots?

gudhoq1,mpzwzj,The FDA/CDC has been terrible with messaging First they consistently push messaging about social distancing and mask wearing post vaccination which is nonsense Once you are fully vaccinated you can go back to your normal life To say otherwise doesnt help with vaccine confidence Now they are pausing J&J over 6 cases of blood clots After weve distributed 7 million shots 0 of which were in males who presumably cant get this shot either while paused Is there maybe a different reason why women between 18-48 got clots like say birth control for example? Doesnt the benefit of the vaccine wildly exceed the incredibly unlikely occurrence of these clots? Obviously How likely are these clots to happen in the general population? Is it 1 in a million? How many people across the world are not going to take the J&J shot now that the CDC paused it?

gue5f9l,mpzwzj,https://healthscimcmasterca/news-events/news/news-article/2021/03/22/mcmaster-scientist-resolves-covid-19-clot-question If the clotting is caused by the immune response (antibodies and platelets) wont it stand to reason that the patient could be given blood thinners on a temporary basis? I think the antibodies go away after a period of time (how long?) and then its the remaining T-Cells that help with an immune response during the next exposure? So presumably there would be no need to be on blood thinners permanently? Although what confuses me is this: Once we go back to normal and people have been vaccinated isnt the whole point that their body will ramp up and make a ton of antibodies real quick in response to exposure to the actual virus? Does this mean there is a risk of blood clotting due to viral exposure for those who have been vaccinated regardless of the vaccine? I need someone who understands immunology better than me to explain all this Does it seem like those who are having the severe reaction to the vaccine are the same folks who would have had a crazy immune system overreaction to the virus? What is it about some peoples immune systems? It is kind of scary to think that were trying to vaccinate for a virus where the main cause of virulence is it wrecks havoc on the immune system,Calendar_Girl,16183348630,1

And I said yea That is the fucking point Meanwhile weve had 2 people die and another seriously sick recently but before the mandate I remember talking to one of these people about how she didnt want the vaccine and I told her that it wasnt that bad for me Shes in her 40s I dont think shes going to make it,jbrandyberry,16418868610,98
hs7f9cd,s11bxi,I guess the silver lining might be that if so many people get it and recover there may come a lull Still sucks in the meantime because the hospitals and urgent cares are slammed My wife had an injury over the holidays that needed an x-ray/medical attention to insure she didnt fracture something Took an eternity to find an urgent care that both had x-ray capabilities and wasnt packed to the gills with COVID people Once we found one they bumped her ahead of all of the COVID people and saw her immediately and the staff was positively ecstatic to have someone in who wasnt COVID-related Meaning they didnt have to suit up with crazy protective gear They also were ecstatic that she: is vaccinated and boosted as well as didnt waltz in maskless with the mentality of "If they want me to wear one they have to provide one" that many of these people seem to have This was in Dallas TX where Im not 100% sure there is some law against people wearing masks anywhere but it sure seemed like it We avoided almost everywhere when we walked in and saw herds of maskless people that looked like the vaccine missed them by country mile,petchulio,16419090790,16

h28g44h,nzm2oo,most of the comments in here make me realize the internet is full of people that just read headlines and never the article The article headline is flimsy at best based on the data as I see no strong correlation between covid numbers rising and getting the jab There are almost equal amounts of low vax rates and low cases as there are high vax rate low cases and further pa for example is almost above the national avg and yet advertises over a 70% vax rate If you consider those that had covid plus those that have been jabbed shouldnt pa be at herd immunity? What this also doesnt take into consideration are variants In certain counties which they curiously picked but I probably would have too in my study there is no differentiator for variants We are already seeing strong real world data showing that many of the vaccines are very ineffective against the D variant originally discovered in India Indias numbers have plummeted but there are widespread reports of falsification of data there so much like Chinas reporting I dont think we can trust that this will just disappear I think the UK is our canary in the coalmine at this point so early into the emergence of this variant There are many folks like myself that just simply dont trust the science behind so much of what has occurred since day 1 of this modern day plague Being allergic to PEG to the point that using shampoo with it causes a mild rash I was told not to take the current offerings and wait for better news to come out for the J/J But all we hear from them is bad news between blood clots and corrupted vials in the millions I feel like the entire globe especially reddit users would like to over simplify vaccines and how to stop this disease Remember the idea of a manufactured disease was laughed at and even censored on these very forums not too long ago Now both sides of the political spectrum are realizing there was an orchestrated cover up by Peter Daszak So what new discoveries will there be about the variants the effectiveness claims of the current vaccines against the new variants and long term effects of the vaccine that lets not forget were originally slated for emergency FDA clearance for older and immune compromised individuals because the potential risk of the vaccine far outweighed the potential risk of covid which for those in that category was a very strong chance of death or at a minimum a painful long possibly perpetual recovery period Harvard and Yale doctors came out together and said there is no reason to vaccinate the young the risks are unknown and the risk of covid for those is also low: [https://wwwmsncom/en-us/health/medical/harvard-stanford-doctors-say-mandating-the-coronavirus-vaccine-unethical/vi-AALbqNq?ocid=entnewsntp&pc=U531](https://wwwmsncom/en-us/health/medical/harvard-stanford-doctors-say-mandating-the-coronavirus-vaccine-unethical/vi-AALbqNq?ocid=entnewsntp&pc=U531) Heres my problem with their statements though As someone pointed out the effectiveness of the vaccines are high and your risk of having a break through case drops dramatically if others are also vaccinated Younger people have been known to be asymptomatic and as such are more likely to spread it as younger people are generally more social in person than older people I dont have the answers but to try and paint this as a black/white conversation is foolish I hope the vaccinated dont have long term health issues but if they did you could bet they wouldnt come back on these forums and apologize to those of us that cant get the current vaccines or are fearful because our scientists and medical community especially our government has shown to be at best a bit inept confused and politically motivated,HyprSl0th,16240387040,0

huqfwc7,sfk3s4,When I was a student I attended a pre-transplant conference where a group of medical professionals and social workers review the recipient list to make sure they are ready An organ is a precious and limited resource Patients who are likely to waste an organ is definitely not a top priority It has nothing to do with what the patient believes in They review alcohol use medication adherence support system appointment adherence etc Vaccination status is also reviewed and what vaccines the patient will need to receive prior to transplant because complications from an infection can put strain on the organ and cause failure or death while on immunosuppressive drugs which the patient has to take for the rest of their life to prevent the body from recognizing the new organ as foreign and attacking it,RepulsiveSherbert927,16434733080,686

hqheep5,rr7div,As someone who works in healthcare I understand covid is real I see it all the time But at the same time even those who are triple vaxxed etc are tired of constantly being told to feel like they cant see any of their loved ones and cant get together with any of their friends but by God theyre going to work And theyre taking even less time off work now with a shorter quarantine People are ready to start living again even if it means having a small risk And at this point as far as Im concerned everybody can make their choice If you want a vaccine its there for you If you dont want it you make your choice Those under 5 years old are such an incredibly low risk anyways that its silly to refute that sentiment by saying "oh but 3 year olds cant get the shot!!" Its time to stop moving goal posts Its time to stop telling people that the only risk theyre allowed to take is going to work but theyre not allowed to take any risks seeing family Covid is real and you should get vaccinated but I can easily understand and agree with why this messaging is absolutely infuriating to so many,SaltySpitoonReg,16408247210,60

hqetozc,rr7div,Every pandemic in human history has ended They end when three factors converge: 1 The virus mutates and becomes less harmful 2 Increased knowledge of the virus treatments vaccines along with built up immunity also limit the virus harm 3 Society as a whole decides this is a manageable level of risk and determines its time to move on with our lives Conditions #1 has more or less been met with Omicron Condition #2 has absolutely been met beyond expectation at that I do worry so many of us never want to meet condition #3 Its never ever ever ever ever ever going away No matter what anyone does There will always be risk There will always be the hypotheticals surrounding mutations or hypotheticals surrounding 6 degrees of someones grandma You can pretend all day long that there are no tradeoffs to virus mitigation and everyone is just being a baby if they dont want to spend the rest of their lives locked at home but we all know that isnt true At some point we just have to accept life is just a little more dangerous than it was 2 years ago,chinatownshuffle,16407873930,366

hqfli4b,rr7div,Politics as usual Its quite frustrating to see the Democrats continue to act as though COVID-19 is not yet endemic and that restrictions like this will halt the spread of the virus or lead to its eradication Of course the GOPs "scientific" rhetoric has been even more appalling but we probably have herd immunity now or as close to it as well realistically get Most unvaccinated Americans have contracted the virus The issue is that immunity through prior infection alone only lasts up to 180 days so a lot of folks who caught Delta this summer are catching Omicron now The Biden administration doesnt seem to have the willpower to push for more industry vaccine mandates like it did this summer so its hard to envision how local decisions like this will have any kind of big picture impact,13abarry,16407990590,2

hqg3yqa,rr7div,Im all for vaccines boosters and masking but I also understand the distrust and skepticism of many of my neighbors Our leaders have truly failed us in the response to this pandemic So many mixed messages so much "do as I say not as I do" and the drum for vaccines is beat so hard that the reluctance to comply of a population that distrusts their government is hardly surprising The messages to skip holiday and family gatherings but to not let Covid keep you from work is particularly jarring Low wage earners and healthcare professionals went from "everyday heroes" back to being treated poorly by management and customers alike Its hardly surprising so many got out of their respective industries and that is particularly true of healthcare workers This pandemic emotionally broke so many and who can blame them?

Zero Im not saying that covid is mild or that we shouldnt care but with the vaccine we were actually far better equipped to fight the next waves until a minority of entitled jerks decided they didnt want to take part of it Everyone is taken hostage by this minority yet we let them continue their pathetic crusade At what point will we start to refuse them to the ER let them assume their position till the end ?

hrpb059,ryb5hr,The hospitalizations are definitely on the rise again and it is hard to predict the peak The healthcare system doesnt have a lot of margin to adjust so this has been a really tough time for every level of the system The good news though is that there are significantly fewer hospitalizations per case so far when compared to all the previous waves In Pennsylvania where one of the doctor interviewed is working the average new cases per day is 22000 and the total number of hospitalized patients is 5600 During the delta wave as the new case levels were nearing their peak in mid September there were only 5800 cases but hospitalizations were already at 2300 4 times as many cases but only twice as many hospitalizations Twice as many hospitalizations terrible for sure but still below the number on the initial wave The article also states that hospitalizations fall 2 weeks behind cases I dont see that trend in the data Total hospitalizations start to go down a week to 10 days after cases start to go down but that is from people being released from the hospital The upward side of the trend seems to be no more than a couple days behind the case count and sometimes not even that All these numbers generally jive in the national numbers as well though with different dates Like I said I feel for hospital workers and their struggle is very real But I think it is helpful to mention the positive trends with the negative ones especially in a time where it can seem like the only news we get is negative Vaccines ARE working Omicron IS less severe than Delta and the mortality rate has been declining consistently There is hope for things to get better (This data is pulled from the CDCs COVID Data Tracker Not posting a link to respect subreddit rules),intrepidpursuit,16415960970,2

hqt7mcf,rt54vc,I look around Connecticut I look around my job I see maskless people I see people who think the vaccines are enough I see people who dont believe in science and the benefits of advanced medicine I see people who whine about masks I see representatives outside of CT whining about masks going on maskless vacations and caving into being weak in the new reality we live in It doesnt help youre not guaranteed any type of immunity from a booster nor double dose You just get extra plates on your armor If you get vaxxed up and dont take the steps necessary like good mask practices (double up no cloth only get sealed medical masks if able WASH YOUR MASKS AND DISPOSE OF YOUR DISPOSABLE MASKS/FILTERS) then you increase your risk of being infected anyways In the US the nation cant commit bureaucratically to a fight Its always flip flopping on the state and federal levels CDC rolled back guidelines for quarantining procedures States like Florida dont care about masks States like CT dont want to reissue mask mandates Were all undereducated on medicine and biology If the goal was to prevent the spread we never had the fortitude to perform the mental commitment We as a country couldnt commit and we ridiculed people who did by applying social pressure to them when they did commit in areas where mandates were lifted Despite knowing this plague has been evolving The public amnesia is to the benefit of this plague Disease will always follow the paths of least resistance,Embarrassed_Union_96,16410495560,4
hqsdudj,rt54vc,Im no anti-vaxxer Im vaccinated but we have to ask questions about whether the attempt to corner Coronavirus through rolling out vaccines en-masse and develop herd-immunity has categorically failed Theres no practical way we can keep up booster shooting with the outbreak of every new variant that seem to be more and more transmissible each time Im no virologist and someone correct me if Im wrong but I remember learning that vaccines potentially encourage viruses to mutate ( although nobody is sure ) We still have no answers as to whether the vaccines might be acting as a catalyst to the emergence of new variants At some point we have to weigh up the benefits of these vaccine boosters and Covid restrictions in comparison to the deadliness of the virus The fatality rate of the Omicron variant is dramatically lower than the other rates weve seen from previous variants since the pandemic begun Its time for world leaders and experts to discuss whether we start to plunge ourselves into another year of Covid restrictions or we transition to living with it the same way we live with the risk of other viruses like influenza or HIV,hoodha,16410268980,4

Too bad for all the unvaccinated people under the age of 5 immunocompromised etc In 20 years when an entire generation of babies who got COVID-19 now start having autoimmune and permanent pulmonary problems scientists will be "trying to figure out why" Yes Im vaccinated and got a booster Pretty much everyone I know has gone to living life like normal A bunch already got COVID-19 again (some even got it in initial wave got vaccine/booster and STILL got infected again this month),NoDozAddict,16410018590,2

What are the mechanism behind it? These questions have yet to be answered and it is the job of public health officials virologists and researchers to make a determination on the risk of these effects Personally I would like to see more information on long term effects but I am leaning more towards opening up restrictions and removing vaccine mandates What are your guys thoughts?,throwaway_mysterious,16410599510,1

gxjjma9,n8dyxl,Viral vector vaccines like Johnson and Johnsons Covid vaccine work by inserting a gene that encodes a particular protein into a benign virus In the case of the J&J vaccine this is an adenovirus that is genetically engineered to express Covids spike protein and further engineered to prevent it from replicating on its own But it doesnt have to be engineered not to replicate We have the technology to produce self-replicating vaccines The vaccine would naturally spread globally Most people would eventually get it It would cost almost nothing The entire world would be getting it simultaneously Wed still want to vaccinate significant numbers of people to ensure its spread but spread it would Obviously there are massive ethical issues here the possibility for something to go wrong and in some ways basically the plot of a Stephen King apocalyptic novel like The Stand Still you have to admit there is something appealing about this Its also possible to do this for diseases animals carry and infect humans with So we could release avian flu vaccines or rabies viral vector vaccines for dogs wolves monkeys bats and more 50000 people die of rabies every year generally a horrific painful terrifying death In the face of that not to mention the animal suffering caused by rabies is it really that crazy to consider releasing a self-replicating generally harmless viral vector vaccine?,gengengis,16205975270,1

ha7111a,pamuzn,after pumping the message of "get vaxed resume life" nonstop putting a new message like this out there which will be interpreted as: "on an individual level theres an undefined amount of additional work to be done afterwards and then maybe well see" is counterproductive imo we cant get double the vaccines in our arms to make up for the stubborn idiots we cant put twice the amount of masks on to make up for the people that dont wear them and we cant lockdown twice as hard for the idiots that partied on spring break throughout the previous peaks reward good reward and punish bad the work that still needs to be done is with local leaders hospitals setting policy companies setting policy for staff etc pivoting from "get vaccinated resume life" to "get vaccinated require vaccines for those ready to resume life resume life" seems like an easier more actionable pivot to accomplish something (besides just inspiring defeatism) than "get vaccinated hope that the dumbest lowlifes catch on eventually and maybe next year you get to live again but stay tuned" on a community level if we could require vaccines/proof of negative tests to participate in "normal" life sooner i think hammering that message would do more to incentivize individuals than when only looking at things nationally/globally good luck getting the crowd that has already done everything more or less right during quarantines mandates etc to continue paying attention while they watched a bunch of hicks bury their heads in the sand cancel out any progress and continue to stay tuned in after already sacrificing a year of life i know its complicated but seems so counterproductive not to spend time also highlighting the spots in the country that succeeded and have been able to have more normalcy already and to balance the national/international gloom and doom with the stark contrast from the cities and communities that have done it right look at floridas deaths currently surpassing the deaths of their previous peaks LONG AFTER A VACCINE HAS BEEN WIDELY AVAILABLE TO THEIR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS (eg 999% of the people that die from covid) then look at the cities that have reached 60-70%+ fully vaxed having music festivals outdoors with no burden on hospital capacity and (except for those highly at risk to begin with those in nursing homes or in healthcare or education) apart from slapping a mask on in an uber and grocery store already are back to normal it was (supposed to be) a team effort until there was a vaccine available for the most at risk which many never participated in or actively sabotaged while others did their part but now that there is a vaccine for the majority of the population and the majority of older folks have gotten it it isnt going to be a one-size-fits-all approach for each individual: qualifying for a vaccine vax rates in the individuals community co-morbidity occupation contact (or lack of contact) with at-risk or groups that cant yet get vaccinated all realistically play more of a role on how much "normal" you get to have the broader context is necessary but its an increasingly hard sell in healthy vaccinated populations to continue to buckle down seemingly endlessly when life itself is insanely short my community has done what it takes and it makes no sense to send a message to the group that has followed marching orders to now wait for the lowlifes in florida to catch up and then maybe u get your normal well be getting boosters before they get a faction of these morons vaccinated fuck em i think about all my friends that own businesses in chicago that barely stayed afloat before there was a vaccine reading this seeing this new "maybe" date (when it could instead be as simple as letting businesses set a policy to reward folks for getting vaccinated) because of some downstate/out of state hillbillies and it makes me sick,lisaleftsharklopez,16298309000,4

he9a4hw,pv629v,Straight up In my area there is a fairly popular local news piece that is going around "Local bar to close down after receiving death threats in regards to vaccine passport and mask mandates" I guess its important to know my area has a vaccine passport and mask mandate The bar was a mid upscale bar Walking past quite literally the shittiest dive bar in my neighborhood last night Hole in the wall doesnt even begin to cut it because at least the hole has a plan The place has a lineup outside the door As Im walking back with my Slurpee I notice that all the boomers are lined up outside with their vaccine passports ready to go and fully masked up Then I see their sign "no mask no passport no liquor" I didnt go in so I wasnt sure how packed it was inside but it got me thinking Why the fuck are the lifer alchololics better at stoping the spread of covid than young "educated" individuals? Then it hit me ignorance is a choice and these young people get metaphorical boners by being contradictory Its my generations fault though we tried really hard to make being a contrarian cool,all_mods_are_losers,16325988510,1

hjjmbui,qnhmc4,No sympathy for him from me I lost my father to covid earlier this year a month before the vaccine was readily available to the public I caught covid after he caught covid from another family member due to an emergency and he tried his best to hide the fact that this virus was slowly but surely beating him As my family was preparing for the funeral we cleaned some of his stuff and among one of his notes was locations and dates and age limits for the vaccine He was waiting for the vaccine avoided covid as much as he could and it breaks my heart that hes not here with us now,sora92120,16362031020,2

hjhykh9,qnhmc4,Hes a critical thinker so he takes ivermectin which isnt proven to treat COVID-19 cases and has safety concerns because somehow that is safer than getting a vaccine that millions have gotten without major side effects I know people have had bad side effects from the vaccine but statistically speaking the vast majority of people are fine And honestly taking drugs is no safer than taking vaccines - there will be people who respond well (of course people who dont abuse them) and there will be people who have horrible side effects to drugs as well even with a proper dosage Im just mind-boggled by the notion that people get so scared of this COVID-19 vaccine but are perfectly fine ingesting drugs that arent even fully proven to treat COVID-19,catlady555,16361637650,1

hjjlfu7,qnhmc4,Among the idiocies of his comments he says he has an allergy to one of the ingredients in the mRNA vaccines (after saying the J&J was out for him because 28 out of 7million ppl got blood clots only 6 of them men) To my knowledge hes not said WHICH ingredient hes allergic to So Im curious if its the salt the sugar the potassium chloride or which one he would be allergic to,sitewolf,16362026100,1

h828k8x,ozr842,Im my mind the only reasonable argument to be made for vaccine mandates is to avoid overwhelming hospitals with sick people I dont think its the governments job to protect people from themselves unless that harm also creates a negative externality for others (like not getting treated for other conditions when all the ICU beds are fill with Covid patients) That said I think many who support mandates are operating on the false assumption that these vaccines are sterilizing or offer enough protection to fully prevent the spread of the virus from vaccinated persons If the virus can still spread whats the point? Also how long before mandated vaccines drop further in efficacy (of preventing spread)?

h81wnkn,ozr842,**[Another perspective if anyone wants it](https://twittercom/KimmelmanJ/status/1423696072065552389)** Just had an extended conversation with a worker who has- thus far- refused to get a COVID vaccine 1/ So many of his concerns were ones I share He is worried about doctors and healthcare systems being bought off by companies 2/ He is worried that too few people are running the world- and that these people know how to use guile fear emotion and if need be brute force to consolidate and extend their wealth and power 3/ He sees in COVID a dense and reinforcing network of governments restricting liberties: controlling and tracking travel deciding what people wear what people put in their bodies And he doesnt trust that governments intentions here are entirely beneficent 4/ He thinks a lot of people- especially in the professional class- are too uncritical of what they read hear and are told to do 5/ He thinks everything human beings touch gets destroyed And thinks we should be open to the possibility that COVID is not a natural event [and its not! all infectious diseases have their origins in human incursions of some sort] 6/ He is not anti-vaccine He sometimes performs work at a major hospital and has seen COVID first hand And he doesnt doubt the science behind the COVID vaccine 7/ So far (except for #4 above) he and I are on the same page [but I see his point about governments forming dense networks of policy to favour their private taskmasters] 8/ And he respects that people might chose not to hire him if he is not vaccinated 9/ He is just sick of being shamed for not getting the vaccine And sick of people dismissing the premises that motivate his hesitancy 10/ So my point here is that a) if you foster conditions where points #2-6 are plausible dont be surprised that some people resist vaccines And b) dont be dismissive of hesitants moral outlook or their capacity for reflection END/,tempdaddi,16283420980,-13

The Corona Cabinet approved: Insulation for returnees from abroad African variant Omicron (Photo: Reuters) South Africa has transferred new information to Israel - and this is the data | Photo: Reuters The contradictory messages of vaccine manufacturers The test of the effectiveness of existing vaccines against the new variant was in its infancy but Modern CEO Stefan Bensel managed to arouse global concern today when he said in an interview with the Financial Times that he expects a significant decrease in vaccine efficacy But Bensel spoke of a decline in benefit from a disease with symptoms rather than a serious illness - a difference that is known to be dramatic in corona contexts as Pfizer CEO Albert Burla was apt to describe: Defense compared to Delta but that would be the limit In both cases the booster vaccines are expected to reduce the gap dramatically " Burla who promised to know more about the benefits of the vaccine against the variant in about a week and a half said Pfizer had already begun developing a specific vaccine against the variant a few days ago "We know the genetic linkage of the virus we have it - thats how it starts" he explained "We started at risk to produce a vaccine We actually started on Friday to produce a vaccine based on the flooring the DNA template that would allow us to make RNA that would eventually women within that vaccine" Israel meanwhile is waiting for a more categorical statement from the two CEOs and meanwhile relies on data coming from South Africa - where the variant was first discovered - and from which it appears that the omicron is more contagious but is no more violent "Data on the benefits of the vaccine - there may be some partial data from South Africa" Dr Sharon Elrai-Price head of public health services said today during a debate in the Knesset I know they are doing the lab tests as I described to see how useful the vaccine against this variant is " Bennett worried: "There is a lot of uncertainty" Albert Burla and Naftali Bennett (Adapted by Reuters) Burla optimistic Bennett explains why he activated the GSS | Arrangement: Reuters At the same time the government is today approving a memorandum of law that will allow it to extend the decision to allow the GSS to verify the cellular devices of those infected with Omicron or the suspects who were infected with it with high probability - in order to interrupt the transmission chains as quickly as possible But just before the move reaches the Knesset the coalition itself is sharply critical of the law Prime Minister Bennett - who saw for himself how in the ministers WhatsApp groups Ministers Saar Shasha-Bitton Barbibai and Avidar voted against - told today why Israel decided to include the GSS in the campaign despite and perhaps because it is a low number of infected "There is a lot of uncertainty and that is why we are taking these extreme measures" he said in a video call with Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schlenberg "But our advantage as leaders is that once we know more when there is more information - we can let go of those measures gradually" As for the restrictions at Ben Gurion Airport the prime minister has already decided that these will last about two weeks from the date of the decision - and only if the final proof does come that the variant does not endanger the populations immunity or the omicron is already spread in the community - these restrictions will be removed Yaron Avraham participated in the preparation of the article,Serenity101,16383425550,2

hmq9bde,r5ueps,Its important to note that Israel counts those eligible for a booster but who havent gotten a booster shot as among the unvaccinated I would speculate that this means that those who have received no vaccine are more than twice as must at risk for serious illness From the Google translated page: "another worrying statistic was discovered regarding the unvaccinated: their risk of becoming seriously ill is 24 times the original strain of the coronavirus the one that arrived in israel nearly two years ago in "unvaccinated" it also refers to those vaccinated in two doses who are entitled to boosters and have not yet been vaccinated and therefore their protection is insufficient",jpoteet2,16383161890,1

hmsrd5d,r5ueps,What is interesting is that there are so many mutations on the spike protein the part the vaccine targets But the protection compares to delta is similar?

hmu4rhj,r5ueps,Reminds me of the initial reports also from Israel of the Delta variant evading vaccines which we later found out to be bogus Not putting much into the danger factor when all cases of Omicron have been mild This link has been going around Reddit like wildfire anyone ever stop to question their numbers?

hngskpl,r9otza,Stuff like this keeps happening and will continue happening It seems like there are rarely any legal repercussions for it and often these people are insulated by their culture of willful ignorance There was an outbreak in my community that landed numerous people in the hospital and directly lead to a death (that we know of) And it was all due to extreme ignorance and negligence The short version: Family did not "believe in" taking covid precautions No masks no social distancing no vaccine etc They went to a large wedding and a short while later came down with symptoms of covid But rather than get tested or isolate they went on vacation during a busy holiday weekend (if memory serves correct) At some point after they got back and only after their symptoms got worse and other people from the wedding started testing positive for covid they got tested No surprise they had covid Despite the test results the father went into to work afterwards And if all that wasnt bad enough one of the family members died They held a large funeral service with at least a hundred and likely many more people than that where covid precautions were not enforced For the sake of argument I can see why folks might give the family the benefit of the doubt in regards to going on vacation while sick but not being 100% certain its covid However going to work after getting back positive test results is malicious and/or negligent and its crazy that there are no repercussions for doing that And having a large funeral in the middle of a local outbreak is reckless and so irresponsible I dont even know how that was allowed to happen,AnnieDickledoo,16388035760,1

Of course But how else do we do this? Stores had a tough time as is policing mask wearing they just cannot possibly police vaccination Overall the anti-vaccination crowd will never change their tune At this point the remaining people that should be targeted are those who want to get a vaccine but are just dragging their feet Vaccination sites are everywhere now and you dont need an appointment Its free This move gives that middle group the last bit of incentive they may need,chozar,16212820630,3

hfkfxux,q2ckda,The creation of a second class citizen group based on medical choice is a fascinating philosophical question that I dont think people are taking very seriously at the moment At the moment for most people this situation seems very cut and dry: "Get vaccine which helps you & others or else suffer the consequences" There are many good public health reasons to encourage vaccination - both via carrots and sticks However moving this premise out 20- 30- 50 years from now as technology advances would we feel comfortable with the same principles applying to other medical interventions? If we discovered a way (gattaca-style) to make some genetic tweaks that ensured a person would be at a much reduced chance for disease transfer in the future -- would that be okay to mandate (or deny services to that person if they didnt receive the genetic tweak)? Maybe so Maybe as society/ technology changes its entirely fine to mandate such things Its just an interesting philosophical question that I think we arent giving full consideration to yet,paro54,16334942450,126
hflsgrk,q2ckda,I mean you cant fault them for that decision Very limited supply and they want them to go to people who will make responsible choices around it all Someone who wont take a vaccine catches the disease it prevents goes to the hospital and gets put on an ECMO and subsequently needs a kidney afterwards You look at that person and think "Are they suddenly going to make good decisions to make this a successful transplant?" Just not likely that will happen Its just a better decision to give those transplants to recipients who arent in this situation due to poor decision-making People who may have been born with a defective organ or have been afflicted by a non-transmissible/preventable disease,petchulio,16335290620,3

h8g1hqm,p1oqh4,I believe its really important for parents to have an idea of the risks of COVID to children so Ive been doing some research recently to assess the risks **I am not an expert -- so I welcome any comments -- but thought this may be helpful as parents navigate this worrisome time** (sorry if youve seen this before -- Ive reposted this on threads that talk about kids and COVID because I think its important to have some idea behind the risks): **Morality Risks:** Obviously theres an extremely fine line to walk here: every death of a child is horrendously tragic and I cannot imagine being the parent of a child who has died or been hospitalized The good news for parents however is that mortality risks still remain low [Out of 74000000 kids in the US 519 have died of COVID since the crisis began (as of July 28)](https://wwwnytimescom/2021/07/29/well/family/back-to-school-covidhtml) This works out to a mortality rate of 00007% or 0015% amongst those who had had confirmed cases of COVID Again this is immensely tragic -- simply put no child should die -- but if I were a parent Id probably be more worried about the prospects for long-term COVID symptoms (discussed below) **Risks of Delta:** Delta is new so there is still much we do not know However data from the UK (where Delta has hit for some time now) gives us some clues Lets start with the good news: [based on data from the UK kids remain the least impacted age group by a long shot](https://wwwonsgovuk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19latestinsights/hospitals#hospital-admissions-by-age)Despite not having access to vaccines kids age 5-14 still have had by far the lowest hospitalization rates of any demographic (this past week its been 108/100000; kids age 0-4 have had noticeably higher rates -- 312/100k -- though still lower than any other age group) Similarly the chance a child would be hospitalized if they had a confirmed case of COVID was similar to prior waves and maybe even a little bit lower The bad news? Well more kids are going to get Delta on account of it being more transmissible particularly in areas where schools arent taking any precautions We all know it and were seeing it now but Delta is insanely more transmissible The fact were already seeing records for hospitalizations amongst kids is extremely bad to say the least The fact this is already occurring with no indications cases nationally are close to peaking is really troubling (An aside: interestingly the UK never break their record for youth hospitalizations with Delta but were breaking it now I really dont know but if anyone has insight itd be interesting to hear) **Risks of Long COVID/The Disease Course More Generally:** We still have lots to learn about long COVID and Delta is new enough that current studies dont really address it For COVID more generally however the earliest studies suggested frighteningly high rates of long-lasting symptoms (one even pegged it at a third!) But these suffered from immense methodological weaknesses such as low sample sizes parental-reported symptoms probable selection bias and no control groups More recent research (which isnt perfect and still includes many of the above weaknesses but is at least somewhat better) has suggested much lower rates than the first studies albeit the risks are real A sampling of some of the more recent work include: * [In a self-reported survey in the UK over 95% of infected kids had no symptoms lasting longer than four weeks and 98% had no symptoms more than 56 days](https://wwwthelancetcom/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext)(and if Im understanding the study correctly it only analyzed kids with symptomatic COVID so there would be lower rates for all infections) * [In a survey from the UK of people who had COVID an estimated 74% of children aged 2-11 reported any symptoms 12 weeks after infection](https://wwwonsgovuk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/prevalenceofongoingsymptomsfollowingcoronaviruscovid19infectionintheuk/1april2021) (this study included a control group) * [In one study with a control group researchers found that kids infected with COVID in Zurich actually were no more likely to report symptoms of long-COVID than kids who were not infected](https://wwwnaturecom/articles/d41586-021-01935-7)To be clear: this study does not imply that long-Covid does not occur However if true it suggests the actual prevalence of long-COVID in kids is likely quite low (This is definitely the most encouraging study I found) So whats the average course of the illness in most children (again with the caveat that most research is pre-Delta)? First off it seems that \~50% of children will be totally asymptomatic ([the Lancet study](https://wwwthelancetcom/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext) cites a source suggesting between 43-68% of cases are asymptomatic) Of those with symptoms the one study found the median symptom duration is 6 days with the most common symptoms being headache and fatigue (see previous link) Three final notes: First we need to be careful when discussing long-COVID and differentiate between symptoms that are bad but manageable (and resolve over time) and symptoms which are debilitating Unfortunately to my understanding current research has not really addressed this adequately In the Lancet study at least (first bullet point) the most common symptoms that lasted in the children who had lasting symptoms were 1) fatigue 2) loss of smell and 3) (to a lesser degree) headaches This doesnt really resolve the question -- depending on the levels of fatigue for example it certainly can be debilitating -- but I think this is something we really shouldnt lose sight of when discussing long-COVID Second: Ive seen concerns on here about organ damage and the like I havent really seen great studies focusing on this on children (I very well may have missed some so do not take this as gospel) Moreover in the studies Ive run across on adults theres lots of jargon and its not always clear what the medical implications of certain findings are Thus I havent really focused on it here -- not because it might not exist but because its above my expertise and I do not want to misinterpret findings Third risks -- even quantified -- are hard to interpret and people will probably have different reactions to the same numbers Lets say [the Lancet study](https://wwwthelancetcom/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext) (showing 18% of children with symptomatic COVID have any symptoms lasting >56 days) is correct On the one hand -- if your child catches COVID -- this means he/she is extremely unlikely to have symptoms that last that long One the other hand -- this still means lots of kids will have symptoms that last a long time **Takeaways:** Building off this last point: people will look at the above data and likely come to different conclusions For me I look at it and feel somewhat reassured -- its not at all that theres zero risk (theres definitely not) and whats currently happening is absolutely tragic but the data speaks to somewhat lower risks than the impression Id likely get if I spent my whole day on this sub But then again Im also not a parent Others may look at the data (particularly the long-COVID studies) and still very reasonably feel worried **In any event -- and I know Im preaching to the choir here -- the most important thing you can do to protect the kids around you is get vaccinated And if you happen to be a parent with a children age 12 or over whos on the fence please get them vaccinated too Itll protect your child from a truly nasty disease and help lower the risk for those around your child too**,Adodie,16286229860,6

Also I have an autoimmune disorder I have had flares with this and other vaccines I am a little concerned about the inflammation from multiple vaccines Even though risk analysis is that the virus is riskier than the vaccine at what point does that start to no longer be the case?

hl0sgxr,qw0f3o,Got my booster last week and I rode in a car for 5 hours over the weekend with a friend who wasnt vaxxed and just tested positive for Covid So far the 4 of us who were vaxxed in the car with him have not got Covid The vaccines work go get yours if you havent!,mastershake04,16371754510,-6
hl054ad,qw0f3o,Some vaccines require multiple doses and others dont The annual flu vaccine is because the flu variants change yearly The vaccine is actually different every year The Covid booster is currently because efficiency wanes over time Since Covid mutates much like the flu it seems unlikely that 3 doses of the same vaccine will be the standard in the long run My guess is that we switch to 6-12 month vaccine shots for life where the manufactures adjust the vaccine to match newer variants I would also love a science break through so that we can increase the speed at which vaccines are approved while also upping the safety,ILoveSherri,16371663510,-9
hl21kgp,qw0f3o,Why is this surprising for so many people? All vaccines have a limited period of effectiveness some shorter than others We are also learning as we go nothing has existed which would have fully prepared us for covid,pfroo40,16371942210,-6
hl1fndd,qw0f3o,Last week I tried to make an appointment with the same people I got the first two from (mostly for record keeping and clarity) and they were wide open My husband talked me out of it because he felt that we werent in the "at risk" category and said to wait until the guidelines changes I asked around reddit and people were like "do it anyway" So today I went to book it again and they were completely booked I called and they said they had no idea they were booked until today It has to do with their supply too and they are full up until Dec 2nd at this point When they check the vaccine cards will it be mandatory to have 3 entries now?

hl1q4mo,qw0f3o,The fuck is with this sub? Are anti-vaxxers trying to infiltrate it or something? We all knew the vaccine wasnt some magic cure and the protection ran out People acting like having to go for a booster jab instead of dying on a ventilator is just a bridge too far,Redcoat-Mic,16371891530,-23
hl1z3wi,qw0f3o,This article is about the UK but it needs to happen in the US if we are going to prevent a winter surge It may be too late CDC being slow to recognize these are 3-dose vaccines will rank up there with being slow on asymptomatic spread and that most transmission is airborne rather than droplet as the biggest mistakes of the pandemic "Fully vaccinated" should mean what it sounds like rather than being a regulatory term If we are to prevent transmission it takes 3 doses to be fully vaccinated,Pickleballer23,16371930980,-5
hl27js3,qw0f3o,All the people going "Im good with 2" in these comments make zero sense Are you just refusing booster shots to be indignant? Having a fit because a virus that doesnt give a shit about whats convenient for you continued to be a problem? Why are you so opposed to a third shot if youve already gotten two and are therefore hopefully not an antivaxx moron (with the obvious caveat of if you have health issues or reaction problems to the prior vaccines) This comment thread and upvotes with borderline anti-vaxx arguments and r/Conspiracy level takes feels more like a bot/brigading attempt than anything similar to the booster discourse on this sub for months Super weird,RagingCaseOfHerpes,16371969950,-14

h1cmtsm,nx2q0e,Here we go again Maybe well get some vaccine eficacy info out of the great corona cruise ship experiments Hope no one will need a ventilator this time!,Swineservant,16233740060,99
h1czrdk,nx2q0e,Just a numbers game 2218 passengers Vaccine efficacy of 95% would put 110 eligible breakthrough carriers aboard Just think if 50% (1100 passengers) of that ship left Florida unvaccinated were amazingly lucky to all be negative before boarding then its Diamond Princess all over started by two asymptomatic vaccinated carriers,tachophile,16233808450,24
h1f9yty,nx2q0e,As was did the very first cruise ship with infected on board during the beginning of the pandemic this will make for some interesting data In a confined sandbox how many will become infected vaccinated and not vaccinated? What variants are circulating on board? Time for some real world real life sandbox data of the vaccine efficacy Hopefully someone writes a paper of this boat if they keep it docked in quarantine,slvneutrino,16234316250,2
h1fjbn7,nx2q0e,Get your vaccines!!!,meanjake,16234357480,2
h1e6irb,nx2q0e,Why do we care about this the cruise company verified that all passengers and crew had a valid vaccine record and were 2 weeks past the last dose everyone was asymptomatic and they only caught it from cautionary routine testing This is what we expect to happen and judging by how they are asymptomatic the vaccine is working as intended It sucks that a handful of people just had their vacation ruined by having to quarantine but its not like theyre going to do anything other than sit in a room for a few days until they test negative I dont see how any of this is breaking news worthy,SpookyDoomCrab42,16234130120,2
h1cup3t,nx2q0e,They have the vaccine acting like this is gonna kill someone Gosh hate the news making the headlines look like having COVID is bad even with vaccine,TheOneAndOnly117-,16233781170,9
h1dbgf2,nx2q0e,Sounds like it was a couple of kids under 18 I guess well see how those vaccines do My parents were vaccinated (theyre 70 and 80) Then someone whod only had his first shot cant to their house and tested positive the next day They were fine I know its anecdotal but hopefully well see a similar outcome here Ill be really glad when most children have had it,cute_but_lethal,16233877790,2
h1dhbon,nx2q0e,Why is this so surprising? The vaccine severely reduces the symptoms but you can still catch it Its something similar to flu now for those vaccinated maybe its time to stop getting paranoid,bm_mane8,16233920240,1
h1e3mbx,nx2q0e,So this is actually good news as it proves that the vaccine does work the people who got infected were both vaccinated and both were asymptomatic This means that they most likely caught the virus from unvaccinated children aboard This is also a warning for Carnival which wont require people to be vaccinated,outofvogue,16234111140,1
h1eytwv,nx2q0e,So two people out of thousands tested positive are asymptomatic and everyone 18+ had to be vaxxed Unless more cases start pooping up this is literally a natural experiment showing vaccine effectiveness no?,ireaditonreddit2016,16234268140,1
h1ez424,nx2q0e,People: "I dont want to be part of a science experiment!" Also people: "We dont want cruises to require vaccines!" Theres an irony that putting hundreds of not thousands of people in an enclosed and shared space for a week is a great science experiment (One that I even being vaccinated have no interest in participating in for the foreseeable future) Now dont get me wrong- I understand everyone on this ship was said to be vaccinated It will be interesting to see if 95% efficacy holds up or if it comes out later that the people who tested positive faked their certificate No matter what the outcome is it certainly is not going to give hope to what will happen if unvaccinated folks are allowed on board cruise ships,politicsreddit,16234269350,1
h1fnv7n,nx2q0e,Thats why they came up with the vaccine Would not bother me in the least to be on a cruise ship,somerville99,16234377410,1
h1g252m,nx2q0e,This barely feels like a story Dont most cruise ships have a capacity for like 3000 passengers?

h1ipcab,nx2q0e,I dont see what the big deal is Vaccines are never 100% The vaccine is to help you build antibodies so it can lessen the symptoms Same with the flu shot you can get the flu but instead of you being sick for a week youll be sick for 2 days,MrAwesomeTG,16235085620,1

h2ijezg,o44201,A story like this is why I wish more people understood that this virus is nothing like the flu This is something that can either be a minor inconvenience or you have cases of people like Mr Kelk here who battled with this for 14 months of unimaginable levels of pain and suffering that nobody should ever go through Yet we still have people who only care about their own desires how they dont care if what their doing could cause someone else to be sick and possibly end up like this poor guy here Its why I lost a good amount of people during all of this both friends and family People I can never call and talk to again ask them how their day was or wish them a happy birthday or more recently hear them wishing a happy birthday to me It just didnt feel the same and honestly I want this virus gone just as much as the next person does which is why I will continue to wear my mask wash my hands and why I chose to get the vaccine,TechDude30,16242605240,10
h2ftogn,o44201,On the issue of people deciding not to vaccinate (people were discussing below): The other problem with a significant number people deciding not to get vaccinated is that the virus stays in circulation and continues to mutate/adapt and the chances of a variant developing that can defeat the vaccines go up So people who dont vaccinate (not including those who have medical conditions that preclude it) actually PUT US ALL at risk Its not a decision that affects only that person Edit: thanks for the upvotes and the award Wish more people would get vaxxed,gzdogs,16242045940,88

gujabbl,mqz31i,I got my vaccine through my employer (hospital) where there was no insurance information exchanged Months later I was graveling to get my mother an appointment and was very surprised that it asked for insurance information It threw me off despite reading this sub daily and knowing the vaccine is free The website did have a box to check if you were uninsured and repeatedly stated you wouldnt be charged,AnotherLolAnon,16184358830,99
gujn6zw,mqz31i,I saw a post in r/Connecticut that someone was charged an administration fee at UCONN Health I copied this off their site >Vaccine doses purchased with US taxpayer dollars will be given to the American people at no cost However vaccination providers such as UConn Health are able to charge an administration fee for giving the shot to someone **Vaccine providers can get this fee reimbursed by the patients public or private insurance company or for uninsured patients by the Health Resources and Services Administrations Provider Relief Fund** Just wanted to make sure people know that if they are uninsured and the place they get the vaccine asks for the fee tell them they have to bill the Feds Dont pay out of pocket,raynethackery,16184423410,72
gujbebe,mqz31i,Many people simply dont know that there is a Department of Health in each county The DOH is responsible for monitoring infection in their area providing COVID tests for those who have no insurance and offering vaccines and tests for things like Hep A B and C viruses like HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases For families with no insurance they can get a child vaccinated properly so that they can go to school and maintain a record of vaccination The DOH will help anyone get a COVID vaccine for free Call them (look them up like this: "Rock County Department of Health") or go online and search the same on Google After registering and verifying your email hit the "Get Vaccinated" button You will be asked which vaccination site youd like to go to Click it and the next screen will show you the available times and dates for appointments Select one You will be given a Square Code which you can save to your phone and will be emailed to you Either bring the phone or print out the code to bring with you If you get a 2-shot vaccine your next appointment will be sent to you immediately,Commandmanda,16184363980,92
guj5qo5,mqz31i,When I called just to get added to a hospital waitlist not even a real appointment they insisted on all my insurance info and literally ran it while I was on the phone to make sure it was valid Honestly I shouldnt have given them that info but I was desperate for a vaccine I wonder how many people they wouldnt even waitlist because they didnt have insurance info I wonder if its even legal to sort appointment availability by who is privately insured Meanwhile I got the shot somewhere else and two months later they text me and ask if I want to schedule an appointment Nope Too late,stinkbugsinfest,16184337900,228

guk21nd,mqz31i,Today the Stanford health Vaccination clinic was a mess Crowded lines inside the building starting from the fourth floor working down the stairs No temp checks or sanitizers 2 hours to get through the appointment while the vaccine part of the process took only minutes The rest of the time was validating paperwork and taking insurance info They made it come across as there is no cost for the vaccine but there is an 80 dollar administration fee charged to insurance Horrible bedside manner way too long spent holding people in a tight space so their insurance could be collected and billed too while all their other info had been collected well in advance Im sure that people would be scared away by the poor communication It freaked my family out and we have insurance and could pay the cost if we had known we were expected to The posting on their website describes it only slightly better by elaborating that its insurance or the government being billed it wasnt announced anywhere vibrantly during the registration and appointment process but wow was money the focus today It was way weird especially in contrast to my experience going to Sutters drive through clinic where I was a respected human being from start to finish Everyone should be comfortable going to get their vaccine but im certain many will be scared off by treatment like that,Iamyouarewewillbe,16184500520,2
guk85wx,mqz31i,I work claims for a major insurer in the USA Ive seen claims come through where the vaccine itself is billed for $000 but the administration of the vaccine is billed separately for various amounts and we pay a small amount on that line So if places can bill insurance for the administration theyre going to But government is paying for vaccine itself Thats what Im seeing anyway Healthcare/ Insurance stuff isnt ever as straightforward as it should be,MisterKXX,16184532590,2

guklcqu,mqz31i,This was hidden in that earlier AP/NORC poll from mid-February that a lot of people cited to generalize about "vaccine hesitancy": https://apnorcorg/projects/safety-concerns-remain-main-driver-of-vaccine-hesitancy/ Some have noted 15% of all adults said they were certain they would not get vaccinated Alternatively and contrasting the overall adult hesitancy 7% of people 60+ yrs old said they were certain they would not get it 507% of all adults had not committed to getting a vaccine (86% unvaccinated of which 59% combined would (only) probably get a vaccine probably not get a vaccine or definitely not get a vaccine) 13% had been vaccinated already including 9% (72% of those 13%) having just one shot and 1% of those 9% = 01% not planning to receive all required doses So ~51% of adults had not committed (yet) to being vaccinated Of those 51% uncommitted 35% thought other people needed it more than them at that time 10% were concerned about cost and 7% had not been recommended by their doctor (all together 52% about cost doctor and priority of those 51% uncommitted) So the fraction of all adults who hadnt committed to vaccination included ~265% of adults who were waiting for their doctor their turn or the cost,mandy009,16184610710,2

Dunno not a doctor Ive had the flu before but this was something else SO got the shot its a matter of time before i need to but Im scared to death of the side effects Not trying to come off as antivax just anxiety I wear my mask everywhere edit: Sooooooo I did the thing for the greater good and took the shot Definitely teetered on the edge of anxiety and panic as I hate needles Had a staph/blood infection in my finger a long time ago and they inserted the needle from the tip of my finger downward about 1/4in so that was the most intense pain didnt feel anything on this covid shot but now im waiting for crappy symptoms,exccord,16184563220,2

Hes the most famous athlete in the world and refused to say for several months whether he was vaccinated or not My guess is he didnt want to lose money from his anti-vax fans and wanted to wait until the vaccine was widely accepted before saying anything Typical power move I am not trying to be too negative Its just frustrating that these 1% superstars that have 100s of millions could influence the whole world with one positive statement that could have saved lives and decide its not in their best interests due to their selfishness Its his right to be private but he could have contributed so much to society if he wanted to Frustrating AF Best of luck to him and his beautiful family I will continue not to care what he says or does and hope that others follow my lead,Mary_Pick_A_Ford,16328682680,1

hjt6fwc,qpcnyc,Canadian here Forget about having them pay; Id like to just send the unvaccinated home Weve read so much about surgeries being canceled or delayed because ICU beds are taken up with COVID patients Just give them two Tylenols tell them to drink lots of water and have them call the coroner in the morning And then formalize it into a law that anyone who has declined a Health Canada recommended vaccine is not eligible for hospital treatment for that disease And I know there are plenty of other decisions and lifestyles people make that put a strain on the public health care system Overeating smoking drinking etc But none of these are as quick and easy to fix as just getting a free shot Nor are we fighting aggressive foreign-funded misinformation campaigns about them I feel like a hard stance needs to be taken that keeping up to date on vaccines is just a basic almost-zero-effort requirement for participating in a modern society particularly one with a public health care system,Hieremias,16363838220,10

hy8lsaq,szo1gx,There is nothing normal about a population that wont universally take mitigating vaccines to buffer the health care system for all Thats called the USA 25% are so fucking stupid and selfish that we will see a large percentage of them die Time to get back to normal There are vaccines there are ways to mitigate There are antiviral treatments Now should we be adjusting some of our normal policies to account for the Covid? sure How about more sick days for people How about FMLA? How about making it so that people who die of Covid especially if they were vaccinated have their families cared for? Probably not gonna happen but its time to stop fucking around and get back to normal Take your vaccines get your treatments wear your mask and lets try to get through this It is endemic,Forsaken-Shallots17,16457096670,2
hy64xwv,szo1gx,Its definitely not normal its a (hopefully) once in a century tragedy! The question is what else can we do? We locked down and started masking in hopes we drove the virus to extinction That didnt work so we kept that up until we had a vaccine available By this point there is a safe effective vaccine that everyone besides small children can get and theyll hopefully be able to get it in the coming months We even have antivirals to combat the virus Whats the goal now? Lockdowns and masks arent going to stop the virus just buy us time by slowing it down And now we no longer know what were buying time for The flu pandemic never really ended we just stopped treating it as exceptional; covid will be the same as hard as that is to accept,yozaner1324,16456605180,5
hy4qzdl,szo1gx,I think were going to see many more articles like this pop up in the next few weeks - many opinion pieces really begging but what is the point of this article? Do I feel bad that so many people passed away? Yes Do I wish more people were smart enough to take the vaccine to reduce risk by a huge factor? Yes But why does every author need to look backwards at casualties and suggest that we should continue to live a life of covered faces and limited contacts? Do they actually think thats a viable long term solution? I just hate how much this article comes of as "Stop pushing for an urgency to normal dont you realize 1000000 people DIED over the course of 2 years"?

hy5y5ch,szo1gx,The problem with this article is the tone it takes and how it tries to use shame to purport its thesis The reality is that the people who need to care a little bit more about COVID death rates are NOT reading Scientific American So who is the audience for this article people who are already vaccinated and boosted and people who probably wear masks to Target but maybe still go out to the movies go to a concert or go out to get a beer with friends theyre the ones responsible for 1000000 COVID deaths? Thats really the narrative we want to go with in 2022 when the Supreme Court struck down Bidens proposal for a national vaccine mandate the GOP refused to pass the Build Back Better bill when it included a ton of social welfare that could have helped bolster long-term changes and the CDC fixed the isolation guidance because a CEO basically said having people stay home while sick was hurting his bottom line? The fact that the author of this article cant even define what he means by "comprehensive pandemic measures" demonstrates that he cares more about sounding smart than actually discussing what factual changes need to be made The fact that the author and people like him do not grasp the fact that preventing more mass death cannot come without higher vaccination rates--which are hardly mentioned in this article at all for some reason--is a sign that many Americans are failing to grasp what is actually helping to prevent deaths both in this country and across the entire world Until more Americans wake up and finally realize what is actually needed were going to continue to see more preventable deaths and shaming people who have already done what they were supposed to do to help other is not going to help anyone,duncan-the-wonderdog,16456576190,5
