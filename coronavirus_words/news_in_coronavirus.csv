h7ax6v3,ovpxdj,If you think the unvaccinated is the **only** thing between you and pre-COVID normalcy you are really misunderstanding our current predicament Yes everyone should get vaccinated ASAP but that is not enough to restore normalcy [Israel is now starting to apply the third dose of the vaccine out of desperation as serious cases begin to rise even among the fully vaccinated](https://wwwhaaretzcom/israel-news/covid-in-israel-serious-cases-rise-as-third-jab-campaign-gathers-steam-110065710),cambeiu,16278172990,56

h7cqrjb,ovpxdj,Thats me but Ive come to a realization A sizeable portion of the public are brainwashed Theyre not stupid theyre not suddenly assholes they have been brainwashed From the moment they wake up and pick up their phone and load Facebook they are bombarded with anti-vax propaganda Then when they turn on Fox News its almost as bad At lunch with they load YouTube for some light relief the algorithm pounds them with anti-vax 5G conspiracy-theory bullshit Same thing day after day theyre exhausted Then when they have a conversation with anyone they say the same thing and suddenly its ok to believe it After 9/11 we all learned about otherwise normal people being radicalized and wondered how it could happen Its happening right now Radicalized= brainwashed,limitless__,16278507560,2
h7c4ce3,ovpxdj,Im just tired at how it seems like no matter what antivaxers always win and the punished ones are people who are vaccinated and are being cautious meanwhile antivaxers are living their life as if nothing happens its so discouraging Plus a lot of news articles seem to be doing everything in their power to make it seem like vaccinated people are still in a lot of danger "300 vaccinated people get infected!!" then fail to mention that those 300 people are only like 06% of the total vaccinated people who were exposed and never got sick Im back to being scared thanks to the media and that only fuels the antivax agenda of "Vaccines are useless" Also the amount of people in this sub pushing the "we will never go back to normal cause we will soon have a variant that will render vaccines useless" is astonishing Ive done my part I got vaccinated and stayed home as much as I could Im not going to stay inside being scared while unvaccinated people are outside,lucinasardothien,16278400860,6
h7c0pz7,ovpxdj,Bad news The CDC says that vaccinated people apparently become infected with and spread the Delta variant as readily as unvaccinated people In other words even if everyone was vaccinated you would not return to "normalcy" Full disclosure: I and everyone in my household are fully vaccinated We arent happy about these latest developments either,Bo_Jim,16278384180,3

The amount of individuals who would follow a religion that specifically states they can not have a vaccine due to their theological teachings HAS to be minuscule and I personally feel most people saying its a religious reason are liars > Buddhism - Buddhism has no central authority that determines doctrine Vaccination is widely accepted in predominantly Buddhist countries > Christianity - The Christian faith consists of multiple different denominations which may differ in theological approach to vaccines > The following Christian denominations have no theological objection to vaccination: Roman Catholicism Eastern Orthodox Oriental Orthodox Amish Anglican Baptist The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormon) Congregational Episcopalian Jehovahs Witness - Note: This denomination originally denounced vaccination but revised this doctrine in 1952 An article in a recent issue of the churchs newsletter promotes vaccination to avoid infectious diseases Lutheran Mennonite Methodist (including African Methodist Episcopal) Quaker Pentecostal Presbyterian Seventh-Day Adventist Unitarian-Universalist The following denominations do have a theological objection to vaccination: Dutch Reformed Congregations - This denomination has a tradition of declining immunizations Some members decline vaccination on the basis that it interferes with divine providence However others within the faith accept immunization as a gift from God to be used with gratitude Faith healing denominations including: Faith Tabernacle Church of the First Born Faith Assembly End Time Ministries Church of Christ Scientist - One of the basic teachings of this denomination is that disease can be cured or prevented by focused prayer and members will often request exemptions when available However there are not strict rules against vaccination and members can receive required vaccinations > Hinduism - Hinduism has no prohibition against vaccines While Hindus venerate cows trace bovine components of certain vaccines have not been identified as a theological concern > Islam - Islam has no prohibition to vaccination There have been several gatherings of Muslim leaders scholars and philosophers to address the theological implications of ingredients in food and drugs including vaccination The Organization of Islamic Conference and 15th annual conference of the International Fiqh Council both concluded that vaccination is acceptable under Islam The Islamic Organization for Medical Sciences concluded that porcine gelatin used in vaccines is acceptable Some muftis (experts in Islamic law) hold that immunization is obligatory (wajib) when the disease risk is high and the vaccine has benefits that far outweigh its risk > Jainism - Jains follow a path of non-violence toward all living beings including microscopic organisms Jains do allow cooking the use of soap and antibiotics and vaccination because this destruction of microorganisms even though regretted is necessary to protect other lives > Judaism - Judaism supports vaccination as an action to maintain health and also as a parental responsibility to protect children against future infection In Judaism the concept of Pikuakh nefesh acting to save ones own or anothers life is a primary value While some vaccines containing porcine derived gelatin Jewish scholars agree that porcine gelatin in injectable form is acceptable > Scientology: in an interview for BeliefNet Rev John Carmichael of the Church of Scientology stated that there are no precepts or strictures about vaccinations within Scientology https://wwwvumcorg/health-wellness/news-resource-articles/immunizations-and-religion,cats_catz_kats_katz,16300867500,83

gwja6gl,n2hns4,**Michigan is now hospitalizing more people under 40 than those over 80 for COVID-19** Dr Stacey Sensor says her 18-year-old son a high school senior is "one of the healthiest people I know" "He works out every single day at five oclock in the morning" said Sensor a Gaylord physician "He takes all these supplements He only eats healthy And he got COVID at the gym "He was quite sick for about eight days" she said "So Im telling you that it doesnt matter what supplements you take what your age is Even in the healthiest individual they still can get it and they can still become very sick and then the effects can be there for quite some time" Its a cautionary tale she said for people who see COVID-19 as a serious health threat for the elderly but a much more benign illness for younger healthier people In fact Michigans current coronavirus surge has turned that assumption on its head: Last week the state was averaging more hospital admissions for COVID patients under 40 than patients age 80 or older The former was about 78 a day compared to 50 for the latter according to data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services The biggest reason for the demographic shift experts say: The difference in vaccination rates About 74% of Michigan residents age 70 and older have gotten at least one dose of vaccine and two-thirds are fully vaccinated For those 16 to 49 the numbers are 36% who have gotten one dose and 23% fully immunized; there is no vaccine authorized for children under 16 Also contributing to the surge of virus among young people is the spread of variants that are both more contagious and more lethal; the tendency of many younger adults to disregard COVID-19 guidelines and the fact that schools have reopened "Its definitely become more of a young person disease now probably because they havent been vaccinated and theyve been more likely than older folks to go out and about be in close contact with others and go to gatherings" said Dr Mark Hamed a physician who is medical director for Huron Lapeer Sanilac Tuscola Alcona Iosco Ogemaw and Oscoda counties The numbers bear that out In the first year of the pandemic Michigan residents age 60 and older accounted for 23% of cases; its now 13% Conversely those under age 20 accounted for 13% of cases during the first 12 months of the pandemic; its now 25% The chart below shows the April case numbers by age group compared to the monthly average through March 2021 as well as compared to December 2020 during the fall surge [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/WNTiwqVd1gGfPM09p2D0qzVgFZY=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/VQGMMSPTZNGADOVJQPKGAWILMQPNG) In theory thats actually a welcomed shift from the standpoint that old age is easily the biggest risk factor for being hospitalized or dying of COVID-19 But experts have been taken aback by the spike in COVID-19 hospitalizations among younger adults and children Compared to the height of the fall surge in early December Michigans average daily hospitalization admissions for COVID-19 are up 33% for those age 18 to 29 58% for thirty-somethings and 64% for those in their 40s Meanwhile hospitalizations for those age 80 and older are down 60% compared to December [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/86v1e7Apdm4-zWbHd-9Q7X4rAh0=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/RPEUG3IW5JGXTF6HQYL2RBK67Upng) "Its like you take what we were seeing before and shift it down by one or two decades" said Dr Joel Fishbain an infectious disease specialist for Beaumont Hospital in Grosse Pointe "Weve got 20-year-olds who are getting admitted and 30-year-olds requiring oxygen which we never saw before and needing as much treatment as we can give them Weve got 40- and 50-year-olds ending up on ventilators" Pediatric cases also are up Last week the state was averaging almost 10 hospital admissions a day among pediatric patients with COVID-19 triple the number in mid-February Deaths among children and younger adults have spiked too In the first 13 months of the pandemic there were six deaths among children ages 10 to 19 In the past month four deaths were reported Another 65 deaths were reported in April for 20- and 30-somethings quadruple the monthly average The chart below compares April deaths to the monthly average through March 2021 as well as to confirmed COVID deaths in December The numbers show how deaths among seniors plummeted in April compared to December as a result of vaccinations while coronavirus variants spiked deaths among unvaccinated people under age 50 [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/caQyJGE9C2BiswUM2ThU22RJumk=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/ZXCIGC7VWZCN7H65ULFSFE4GPIPNG) Deaths and hospitalizations arent the only concern While most COVID patients under age 50 "dont get severely ill there are a growing number of people who have long-haul COVID symptoms" said Dr Liam Sullivan an infectious disease specialists with Spectrum Health in Grand Rapids "They have problems with smelling with taste with concentration with memory with fatigue with night sweats "So even though they had a mild illness the first time around theyre still dealing with these things month and months later and thats not something you want to deal with when youre 25 or 35" he said "Of course you dont want to deal with it at any age but especially when youre in the prime of your life" And for women the research is growing on the dangers of COVID-19 during pregnancy Dr Kurt Wharton an Oakland County obstetrician currently has four pregnant patients in intensive care units battling COVID-19 All four are "fighting for their lives" said Wharton who works at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak While COVID-19-related deaths among pregnant women remain very rare Wharton and others say the evidence is growing that coronavirus during pregnancy can put a woman at a much higher risk of preterm birth preeclampsia and admission to the ICU and/or intubation especially if the woman has pre-existing conditions such as high blood pressure obesity diabetes or heart disease Evidence growing on COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy: Virus is dangerous; the shots are not Doctors offer several theories on why more younger people are getting significantly ill with COVID-19 in the current surge One is the spread of variants which are both more contagious and more lethal The variants are "stickier" Hamed said which means it takes less exposure to make someone severely ill or even symptomatic Wharton noted the same pattern happened during the 1918 influenza pandemic The initial surge in the spring of 1918 primarily impacted the elderly and babies But the virus mutated and came roaring back in the fall of 1918 and its primary victims during that surge were younger adults "History is repeating itself" Wharton said Another issue suggests Hamed and others: More unvaccinated people are gathering in groups without masks That increases the risk of exposure to a higher viral load which has been associated with more severe disease "The best mask you wear the less viral load you inhale" Wharton said On top that many schools have reopened and children and younger adults in particular are resuming their pre-pandemic social lives "You can see it" Wharton said "Younger people are all out in groups again walking down sidewalks shopping going to restaurants and bars together They just think theyre invulnerable" The good news is that COVID-19 vaccinations have proven "wildly successful" in significantly reducing the chances of getting the virus and spreading to others Sullivan said And just as vaccinations have blunted spread of the virus among senior citizens the spread of COVID among younger adults can be stymied through immunization shots Vaccination programs "really need to target the younger people right now" Sensor said "Theyre the ones who are getting sick Weve done a really good job of vaccinating our older population but to really move forward and get out of this pandemic we really need our younger people to step up to the plate and get the vaccine to protect themselves and protect their families",itsdr00,16198732450,154

gue62ir,mpzwzj,The vaccines are incredibly safe The odds of having a blood clot or dying for one are miniscule at best And certainly much lower than dying or having LONG covid Even for Young people University of Cambridge did an excellent mathematical treatment here with supporting charts: [https://wintoncentremathscamacuk/news/communicating-potential-benefits-and-harms-astra-zeneca-covid-19-vaccine/](https://wintoncentremathscamacuk/news/communicating-potential-benefits-and-harms-astra-zeneca-covid-19-vaccine/) Even people under 30 are better off taking the vaccine vs the chance of Covid And this is for fatality only One could get Covid and have long term disability as well And this is for the Astra-Zeneca vaccine compared to which the J&J has fewer instances of blood clots,iamjimmy15,16183351510,11
guem6ev,mpzwzj,I know america is going to be fine with just pfizer and moderna but a pandemic is a world health issue and america cant isolate completely forever Covid will be over when the world rids itself of the virus I believe j&j fears are overreaction but the news itself definitely will slow down uptake by people and thus prolonging the pandemic Basically dont celebrate too early and go to facts over sensationalist news The flu vaccine kills a number of people each year as well covid vaccines should be seen in a different light than any other vaccine Once j&j resumes anyone eligible should take it asap,user13472,16183423550,3

I would assume I have little or nothing to worry about although I guess I should be more mindful of any symptoms just in case It does not hurt to be diligent and keep an eye out for myself I really dont know what to make of all this I "guess" being vaccinated was still the right choice I would argue the alternative could have been worse I made an informed choice with the information I had which is really all anyone could do right?! ,Linux-Is-Best,16183299540,2

gue5f9l,mpzwzj,https://healthscimcmasterca/news-events/news/news-article/2021/03/22/mcmaster-scientist-resolves-covid-19-clot-question If the clotting is caused by the immune response (antibodies and platelets) wont it stand to reason that the patient could be given blood thinners on a temporary basis? I think the antibodies go away after a period of time (how long?) and then its the remaining T-Cells that help with an immune response during the next exposure? So presumably there would be no need to be on blood thinners permanently? Although what confuses me is this: Once we go back to normal and people have been vaccinated isnt the whole point that their body will ramp up and make a ton of antibodies real quick in response to exposure to the actual virus? Does this mean there is a risk of blood clotting due to viral exposure for those who have been vaccinated regardless of the vaccine? I need someone who understands immunology better than me to explain all this Does it seem like those who are having the severe reaction to the vaccine are the same folks who would have had a crazy immune system overreaction to the virus? What is it about some peoples immune systems? It is kind of scary to think that were trying to vaccinate for a virus where the main cause of virulence is it wrecks havoc on the immune system,Calendar_Girl,16183348630,1

gvh7m5x,mpzwzj,There was concern that this pause will hurt more than help and scare some people away from J&J I would just like to confirm that is true J&J was my vaccine of choice and I had an appt scheduled It was cancelled due to the pause Each day of pause my confidence in it has gone down I read a news article today and have now decided that 1 in a million chance is not worth it and I put this vaccine in the same category of Sputnik and AZ I will now be getting the Pfizer vac By pausing the CDC has stated the risks of J&J may be worse than Covid so do not risk taking the J&J,campingthisweekend,16191181150,1

What this also doesnt take into consideration are variants In certain counties which they curiously picked but I probably would have too in my study there is no differentiator for variants We are already seeing strong real world data showing that many of the vaccines are very ineffective against the D variant originally discovered in India Indias numbers have plummeted but there are widespread reports of falsification of data there so much like Chinas reporting I dont think we can trust that this will just disappear I think the UK is our canary in the coalmine at this point so early into the emergence of this variant There are many folks like myself that just simply dont trust the science behind so much of what has occurred since day 1 of this modern day plague Being allergic to PEG to the point that using shampoo with it causes a mild rash I was told not to take the current offerings and wait for better news to come out for the J/J But all we hear from them is bad news between blood clots and corrupted vials in the millions I feel like the entire globe especially reddit users would like to over simplify vaccines and how to stop this disease Remember the idea of a manufactured disease was laughed at and even censored on these very forums not too long ago Now both sides of the political spectrum are realizing there was an orchestrated cover up by Peter Daszak So what new discoveries will there be about the variants the effectiveness claims of the current vaccines against the new variants and long term effects of the vaccine that lets not forget were originally slated for emergency FDA clearance for older and immune compromised individuals because the potential risk of the vaccine far outweighed the potential risk of covid which for those in that category was a very strong chance of death or at a minimum a painful long possibly perpetual recovery period Harvard and Yale doctors came out together and said there is no reason to vaccinate the young the risks are unknown and the risk of covid for those is also low: [https://wwwmsncom/en-us/health/medical/harvard-stanford-doctors-say-mandating-the-coronavirus-vaccine-unethical/vi-AALbqNq?ocid=entnewsntp&pc=U531](https://wwwmsncom/en-us/health/medical/harvard-stanford-doctors-say-mandating-the-coronavirus-vaccine-unethical/vi-AALbqNq?ocid=entnewsntp&pc=U531) Heres my problem with their statements though As someone pointed out the effectiveness of the vaccines are high and your risk of having a break through case drops dramatically if others are also vaccinated Younger people have been known to be asymptomatic and as such are more likely to spread it as younger people are generally more social in person than older people I dont have the answers but to try and paint this as a black/white conversation is foolish I hope the vaccinated dont have long term health issues but if they did you could bet they wouldnt come back on these forums and apologize to those of us that cant get the current vaccines or are fearful because our scientists and medical community especially our government has shown to be at best a bit inept confused and politically motivated,HyprSl0th,16240387040,0

hrpb059,ryb5hr,The hospitalizations are definitely on the rise again and it is hard to predict the peak The healthcare system doesnt have a lot of margin to adjust so this has been a really tough time for every level of the system The good news though is that there are significantly fewer hospitalizations per case so far when compared to all the previous waves In Pennsylvania where one of the doctor interviewed is working the average new cases per day is 22000 and the total number of hospitalized patients is 5600 During the delta wave as the new case levels were nearing their peak in mid September there were only 5800 cases but hospitalizations were already at 2300 4 times as many cases but only twice as many hospitalizations Twice as many hospitalizations terrible for sure but still below the number on the initial wave The article also states that hospitalizations fall 2 weeks behind cases I dont see that trend in the data Total hospitalizations start to go down a week to 10 days after cases start to go down but that is from people being released from the hospital The upward side of the trend seems to be no more than a couple days behind the case count and sometimes not even that All these numbers generally jive in the national numbers as well though with different dates Like I said I feel for hospital workers and their struggle is very real But I think it is helpful to mention the positive trends with the negative ones especially in a time where it can seem like the only news we get is negative Vaccines ARE working Omicron IS less severe than Delta and the mortality rate has been declining consistently There is hope for things to get better (This data is pulled from the CDCs COVID Data Tracker Not posting a link to respect subreddit rules),intrepidpursuit,16415960970,2

hr9mktt,rw0223,I didnt realise 4th doses were actually a thing already Sure some countries are doing it but > More data is needed to ascertain "whether when and how often those who are vulnerable will need additional doses" [the oxford vaccine scientist] said > "I think its too premature to be talking about a fourth dose" Fauci told Michael Wallace and Steve Scott of WCBS Newsradio 880 Also this > "We cant vaccinate the planet every four to six months Its not sustainable or affordable" Is there actually any evidence that six monthly vaccinations are indicated ? "Its not sustainable or affordable to buy every person on the planet a new car each year" Regardless hard to believe that this wouldnt be a solvable problem Especially with variants more likely to come from unvaccinated populations (in poorer countries) theres a huge incentive to build out vaccination infrastructure I wonder how perceptions will change in the future Theres a lot of frustrated "Im done with this" comments in this thread which is fair enough I guess but for me personally if it were a 15 minute errand each year to get a booster / update and mitigate some of the risk of getting covid I cant imagine why I wouldnt do that Ive been getting the flu shot for years Even if it were just a mild reduction in the chances of contracting a mild illness I would still do that,pseudont,16413323950,0

hqtrnvx,rt54vc,This is good news Now dont get me wrong I fully understand that many are in danger but hear this out: do you prefer to get covid while its weaker than ever experience it (in most cases) like the flu and also have antibodies afterwards or experience delta variant which kills way more people than omicron and is overall more dangerous I think omicron signals that we are towards the end of the pandemic cause since it spreads faster than any other it will mean that way more people will get atleast some antibodies which will make them almost immune to covid thus making it way harder to spread until its so weak it can hardly kill or even show symptoms This is the normal outcome of a virus its destined to be like that The problem a virus faces when killing its host is that it cant spread as easy as it would if the host was kept alive If the virus is weaker the host will not die or have any functioning problems so they will probably pass it to others keeping it alive PS: Im no doctor so dont take my words for granted If Im wrong please correct me,XRISTOS128,16410586460,2

hqtdz7j,rt54vc,I think we all need to accept the fact that covid is here to stay and that we all will be getting covid eventually The good news is that even though the numbers are relatively higher than theyve ever been a new case rate of say 140/100000 is still just 14% of the population making real risks (ie long term negative health outcomes) low for those who are vaccinated Even if unvacced most people who get covid turn out fine its mainly those with core morbidities who are are at a higher risk Yes we should still act to protect the vulnerable - for example I live with someone who is immunocompromised and am careful about my interactions - but ultimately it appears to me that if you are vaccinated you should still live life like you want to After all it seems like having fun and enjoying life again makes it worth getting sick for a week or 10 days After that you are presumed to have antibodies which only protects you more,_bad_bam_,16410526950,1

The Corona Cabinet approved: Insulation for returnees from abroad African variant Omicron (Photo: Reuters) South Africa has transferred new information to Israel - and this is the data | Photo: Reuters The contradictory messages of vaccine manufacturers The test of the effectiveness of existing vaccines against the new variant was in its infancy but Modern CEO Stefan Bensel managed to arouse global concern today when he said in an interview with the Financial Times that he expects a significant decrease in vaccine efficacy But Bensel spoke of a decline in benefit from a disease with symptoms rather than a serious illness - a difference that is known to be dramatic in corona contexts as Pfizer CEO Albert Burla was apt to describe: Defense compared to Delta but that would be the limit In both cases the booster vaccines are expected to reduce the gap dramatically " Burla who promised to know more about the benefits of the vaccine against the variant in about a week and a half said Pfizer had already begun developing a specific vaccine against the variant a few days ago "We know the genetic linkage of the virus we have it - thats how it starts" he explained "We started at risk to produce a vaccine We actually started on Friday to produce a vaccine based on the flooring the DNA template that would allow us to make RNA that would eventually women within that vaccine" Israel meanwhile is waiting for a more categorical statement from the two CEOs and meanwhile relies on data coming from South Africa - where the variant was first discovered - and from which it appears that the omicron is more contagious but is no more violent "Data on the benefits of the vaccine - there may be some partial data from South Africa" Dr Sharon Elrai-Price head of public health services said today during a debate in the Knesset I know they are doing the lab tests as I described to see how useful the vaccine against this variant is " Bennett worried: "There is a lot of uncertainty" Albert Burla and Naftali Bennett (Adapted by Reuters) Burla optimistic Bennett explains why he activated the GSS | Arrangement: Reuters At the same time the government is today approving a memorandum of law that will allow it to extend the decision to allow the GSS to verify the cellular devices of those infected with Omicron or the suspects who were infected with it with high probability - in order to interrupt the transmission chains as quickly as possible But just before the move reaches the Knesset the coalition itself is sharply critical of the law Prime Minister Bennett - who saw for himself how in the ministers WhatsApp groups Ministers Saar Shasha-Bitton Barbibai and Avidar voted against - told today why Israel decided to include the GSS in the campaign despite and perhaps because it is a low number of infected "There is a lot of uncertainty and that is why we are taking these extreme measures" he said in a video call with Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schlenberg "But our advantage as leaders is that once we know more when there is more information - we can let go of those measures gradually" As for the restrictions at Ben Gurion Airport the prime minister has already decided that these will last about two weeks from the date of the decision - and only if the final proof does come that the variant does not endanger the populations immunity or the omicron is already spread in the community - these restrictions will be removed Yaron Avraham participated in the preparation of the article,Serenity101,16383425550,2

h8g1hqm,p1oqh4,I believe its really important for parents to have an idea of the risks of COVID to children so Ive been doing some research recently to assess the risks **I am not an expert -- so I welcome any comments -- but thought this may be helpful as parents navigate this worrisome time** (sorry if youve seen this before -- Ive reposted this on threads that talk about kids and COVID because I think its important to have some idea behind the risks): **Morality Risks:** Obviously theres an extremely fine line to walk here: every death of a child is horrendously tragic and I cannot imagine being the parent of a child who has died or been hospitalized The good news for parents however is that mortality risks still remain low [Out of 74000000 kids in the US 519 have died of COVID since the crisis began (as of July 28)](https://wwwnytimescom/2021/07/29/well/family/back-to-school-covidhtml) This works out to a mortality rate of 00007% or 0015% amongst those who had had confirmed cases of COVID Again this is immensely tragic -- simply put no child should die -- but if I were a parent Id probably be more worried about the prospects for long-term COVID symptoms (discussed below) **Risks of Delta:** Delta is new so there is still much we do not know However data from the UK (where Delta has hit for some time now) gives us some clues Lets start with the good news: [based on data from the UK kids remain the least impacted age group by a long shot](https://wwwonsgovuk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19latestinsights/hospitals#hospital-admissions-by-age)Despite not having access to vaccines kids age 5-14 still have had by far the lowest hospitalization rates of any demographic (this past week its been 108/100000; kids age 0-4 have had noticeably higher rates -- 312/100k -- though still lower than any other age group) Similarly the chance a child would be hospitalized if they had a confirmed case of COVID was similar to prior waves and maybe even a little bit lower The bad news? Well more kids are going to get Delta on account of it being more transmissible particularly in areas where schools arent taking any precautions We all know it and were seeing it now but Delta is insanely more transmissible The fact were already seeing records for hospitalizations amongst kids is extremely bad to say the least The fact this is already occurring with no indications cases nationally are close to peaking is really troubling (An aside: interestingly the UK never break their record for youth hospitalizations with Delta but were breaking it now I really dont know but if anyone has insight itd be interesting to hear) **Risks of Long COVID/The Disease Course More Generally:** We still have lots to learn about long COVID and Delta is new enough that current studies dont really address it For COVID more generally however the earliest studies suggested frighteningly high rates of long-lasting symptoms (one even pegged it at a third!) But these suffered from immense methodological weaknesses such as low sample sizes parental-reported symptoms probable selection bias and no control groups More recent research (which isnt perfect and still includes many of the above weaknesses but is at least somewhat better) has suggested much lower rates than the first studies albeit the risks are real A sampling of some of the more recent work include: * [In a self-reported survey in the UK over 95% of infected kids had no symptoms lasting longer than four weeks and 98% had no symptoms more than 56 days](https://wwwthelancetcom/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext)(and if Im understanding the study correctly it only analyzed kids with symptomatic COVID so there would be lower rates for all infections) * [In a survey from the UK of people who had COVID an estimated 74% of children aged 2-11 reported any symptoms 12 weeks after infection](https://wwwonsgovuk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/prevalenceofongoingsymptomsfollowingcoronaviruscovid19infectionintheuk/1april2021) (this study included a control group) * [In one study with a control group researchers found that kids infected with COVID in Zurich actually were no more likely to report symptoms of long-COVID than kids who were not infected](https://wwwnaturecom/articles/d41586-021-01935-7)To be clear: this study does not imply that long-Covid does not occur However if true it suggests the actual prevalence of long-COVID in kids is likely quite low (This is definitely the most encouraging study I found) So whats the average course of the illness in most children (again with the caveat that most research is pre-Delta)? First off it seems that \~50% of children will be totally asymptomatic ([the Lancet study](https://wwwthelancetcom/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext) cites a source suggesting between 43-68% of cases are asymptomatic) Of those with symptoms the one study found the median symptom duration is 6 days with the most common symptoms being headache and fatigue (see previous link) Three final notes: First we need to be careful when discussing long-COVID and differentiate between symptoms that are bad but manageable (and resolve over time) and symptoms which are debilitating Unfortunately to my understanding current research has not really addressed this adequately In the Lancet study at least (first bullet point) the most common symptoms that lasted in the children who had lasting symptoms were 1) fatigue 2) loss of smell and 3) (to a lesser degree) headaches This doesnt really resolve the question -- depending on the levels of fatigue for example it certainly can be debilitating -- but I think this is something we really shouldnt lose sight of when discussing long-COVID Second: Ive seen concerns on here about organ damage and the like I havent really seen great studies focusing on this on children (I very well may have missed some so do not take this as gospel) Moreover in the studies Ive run across on adults theres lots of jargon and its not always clear what the medical implications of certain findings are Thus I havent really focused on it here -- not because it might not exist but because its above my expertise and I do not want to misinterpret findings Third risks -- even quantified -- are hard to interpret and people will probably have different reactions to the same numbers Lets say [the Lancet study](https://wwwthelancetcom/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext) (showing 18% of children with symptomatic COVID have any symptoms lasting >56 days) is correct On the one hand -- if your child catches COVID -- this means he/she is extremely unlikely to have symptoms that last that long One the other hand -- this still means lots of kids will have symptoms that last a long time **Takeaways:** Building off this last point: people will look at the above data and likely come to different conclusions For me I look at it and feel somewhat reassured -- its not at all that theres zero risk (theres definitely not) and whats currently happening is absolutely tragic but the data speaks to somewhat lower risks than the impression Id likely get if I spent my whole day on this sub But then again Im also not a parent Others may look at the data (particularly the long-COVID studies) and still very reasonably feel worried **In any event -- and I know Im preaching to the choir here -- the most important thing you can do to protect the kids around you is get vaccinated And if you happen to be a parent with a children age 12 or over whos on the fence please get them vaccinated too Itll protect your child from a truly nasty disease and help lower the risk for those around your child too**,Adodie,16286229860,6

gwt3hoo,n3u6kx,Very happy news! Im just jealous because my kids are 7 and 10 Its tough explaining to young kids why theyll need to mask and distance longer but theyre two smart cookies and Im sure theyll understand,hamudm,16200639160,9
gwsgili,n3u6kx,I think this is great news For a variety of reasons I know that age range doesnt ( as a rule ) get as severe reactions to the virus as older people but Id still feel better with children that age having the ability to get it,geneaut,16200542660,6

gwsx8dw,n3u6kx,Can we immediately vaccinate 12-15 or would CDC need to provide guidance before its rolled out This is awesome news as I have a 12 year old daughter I have another 8 year old and i hope she gets approval also in the near future,shawman123,16200612930,3
gwtn588,n3u6kx,I know this is great news personally for many American families but I see it as bad news for the rest of the world Were going to start vaccinating teenagers when other countries have barely started vaccinating elderly due to lack of supply and having more eligible Americans means more stockpiling vaccines instead of sending them to where theyre desperately needed,conceptalbums,16200722380,2
gwtxkmv,n3u6kx,Finally! Thats great news,neutral_cloud,16200768160,3
gwsez2j,n3u6kx,This is amazing news Vaccinating those 16+ did a lot to dramatically lower Covid spread but we were never going to be able to entirely beat Covid by just vaccinating people 16 and over Currently our Covid rates in the US are similar to what they were in early October but once we start vaccinating those 12+ I would expect that number to drop back down to August and early September levels which would be a big improvement,socialistrob,16200535730,3

I recall that someone posted here a couple of days ago they were at tipping point where vaccine would really start to show positive results Cannot read Portuguese or Spanish Thanks Edit: well Downvote if you like to I havent seen news about the situation in the two countries for a couple of days Since this sub doesnt allow asking questions so had to hijack some post,fqye,16200448820,-32

hl0fgqi,qw0f3o,Been expecting this since Covid first hit Its a virus that mutates similar to colds and flus No vaccine for colds and flu shots every year Therefore we can most likely expect regular Covid shots Hopefully they will continue to evolve the shots to be more effective against variants but absolutely none of the news about immunity waning or boosters being needed has been a surprise,dawno64,16371703970,67

h1cnrne,nx2q0e,Both were asymptomatic and vaccinated Nothing really newsworthy,Varolyn,16233745040,242
h1cnez0,nx2q0e,Its two breakthrough cases Did anyone read the article? Everyone on the ship is required to be vaccinated Make it news when someone has a breakthrough case thats severe > Both people are asymptomatic (Edit: added a quote from article),Bobwhilehigh,16233743170,59
h1d80zx,nx2q0e,This is news why?,wontinle,16233856150,3
h1e6irb,nx2q0e,Why do we care about this the cruise company verified that all passengers and crew had a valid vaccine record and were 2 weeks past the last dose everyone was asymptomatic and they only caught it from cautionary routine testing This is what we expect to happen and judging by how they are asymptomatic the vaccine is working as intended It sucks that a handful of people just had their vacation ruined by having to quarantine but its not like theyre going to do anything other than sit in a room for a few days until they test negative I dont see how any of this is breaking news worthy,SpookyDoomCrab42,16234130120,2

h1e3mbx,nx2q0e,So this is actually good news as it proves that the vaccine does work the people who got infected were both vaccinated and both were asymptomatic This means that they most likely caught the virus from unvaccinated children aboard This is also a warning for Carnival which wont require people to be vaccinated,outofvogue,16234111140,1

gujakiz,mqz31i,This surprised me but I had an interaction at work a couple days ago re this Asked someone if hed gotten it yet and I said "nah I cant afford that shit" Told him it was free and he was legit surprised Couldnt believe he hadnt heard that but then I guess you cant underestimate how many people just arent exposed to the news or other channels of information,Soytaco,16184360050,1898
guk9zxg,mqz31i,Considering zero news reports on the vaccine that Ive heard or read have mentioned this; its not very surprising,smoothallday,16184542440,7
gulacut,mqz31i,The American Healthcare system created this problem by dubiously charging some people to be TESTED for COVID-19 towards the start of the pandemic which was reported by multiple news outletsso theres no surprise that many would believe the vaccine and its reputation as hard to obtain wouldnt have some cost associated with them,shadstatic,16184837570,5

gujkob0,mqz31i,Not an uncommon myth unfortunately From my overseas friends (who only hear about how expensive healthcare is from news and probably reddit) the first thing they asked was how much it costs and I told them this was the rare time the government truly made something free,whitechoclax,16184410090,14

gujji5t,mqz31i,There have been stories in the news periodically about a for-profit clinic offering vaccine and then charging hundreds of $s for the "service" of injecting the free vaccine Those stories get reported on local news of course Some people never get past that point,Natoochtoniket,16184404060,1
