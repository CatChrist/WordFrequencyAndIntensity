gzvqvfo,nniy3y,Ima set aside the stupidity of this and simply remind everyone that any mandate your employer wants to implement must be applied to uniformly to everyone for it to be legal &#x200B; For example if your company threatens to fire you for being unvaccinated; they must also fire every unvaccinated full time employee that has been working there for years (**employees whom the company has already invested allot of time and money in training**) If they cherry pick just you then that is discrimination &#x200B; In typical media fashion allot of articles try to place shift the blame onto the individual as if claiming "If YOU dont get the vaccine YOU will face the consequences of not being allowed to work"; when in really the language of these laws is tailored to the employers choice not the employee and should instead be reported as "If WE want to hinder our hiring pool to only vaccinated people we will" **You (the individual employee) are not choosing to be unemployed for not being vaccinated your boss is choosing to fire you** So no need to worry about whether they can or cant mandate this They wont do it because it will for certain cause a labor shortage to them and potentially a discrimination lawsuit if they use it as a reason to fire only the employees they dont like &#x200B; ps: if youre going to post the dumbass response of "many employers already mandate it hurr hurr hurr"; please enlighten us and list specifically which ones Yea Yea Yea you read some article saying that companies are going to do it Name then tell us specifically which companies are right now mandating the vaccine and have fired or are otherwise threatening to fire unvaccinated employees,AbortedBaconFetus,16223037430,3

If actually walking behind people is your way to know they are productive--Id say its time to work on your business processes and get better at project management The ONLY thing Ill miss is a good whiteboard session in person I hate Zoom video its uncanny valley x4 I minimize the thing unless someone is screen sharing Thankfully 95% of our Zoom meetings are audio only,ZenZulu,16296457000,602
h9y8plp,p9dd93,I really feel like permanent WFH at least for a plurality of the *white-collar* workforce is where were headed This is what the employees want and at a certain point if they dont acquiesce then they simply wont retain their workers I want to repeat one of the words in my first sentence though: white-collar There are segments of our service economy that absolutely depend on those white-collar workers headed into the office every day I think about the urban neighborhood where my desk was located: coffee shops lunch places grocery stores that catered to the on my way home crowd hotels that survive on the conference attendees etc etc Its easy to argue that these folks have had almost two years to figure it out at this point but have they? Have the thousands of service employees that depend on those jobs to pay their rent and feed their kids figured it out or are they still depending on aid and hoping things go back to normal? Im not denying that WFH is desirable and going to happen for a lot of people But in a country (Im the US just to be clear) that has an increasing economic divide I cant help but believe that it exacerbates as it becomes more and more likely that urban office neighborhoods are going to be seriously depopulated if they come back at all,georgethethirteenth,16296641290,19

h9x38c3,p9dd93,Ive been managing a remote engineering team for about 15 years- long long before Covid After managing onsite teams for about 15 before that It is IMHO night and day more difficult to manage the remote team And IMHO most of the issues solved by remote work are actually issues with horrible open offices and long commutes- not anything specifically to do with remote vs onsite work Some thoughts from doing this for over a decade: * 25% of people will be productive no matter where they are 25% will be problematic no matter where they are 50% of people work better with some form of office infrastructure Everyone thinks they are in that first 25% * Dealing with HR issues is much much more problematic with remote employees Try dealing with terming someone with a substance abuse problem when you never get to see them in person and dont have an attendance record to support your HR case * Peoples home environments are often horribly full of distractions People put up with this during Covid because there were no other alternatives- but having someones toddler running around screaming during meetings is an issue A good WFH environment will have a dedicated home office and a good WFH employee will have uninterrupted time in that office- but most dont have their home workspaces set up properly * Peoples WFH performance deteriorates over time- especially over many years Especially with employees with kids who only one parent is WFH Suddenly you realize that you are working around an employee who has to pick up the kids from school every day during work hours- folks start building lives/schedules around being able to disappear for a couple hours a day * There are simply no good current tech substitutes for a classic conference room whiteboard session Doing this remotely sucks All of that can be managed with appropriate focus/tools/etc But it adds substantially to the managerial effort required I think it seemed to work during Covid better than it would have because many tech firms paused or slowed down their project work during that period (I know all of my clients basically shelved most of the project deliverables last/this year and we are just now getting back to regular project planning cycles) Well see maybe Ill be wrong and the tech has progressed to the point where this will work I think the norm is going to become hybrid plans where folks are in the office a couple days a week but cant fully live anywhere they want,jakdak,16296461930,43

h9zjtur,p9dd93,I have lifelong friendships and business references from working with people in an office It sounds great maybe if you are young and still in touch with school/university people for your social life Even having offices move to WFH seems great because all your coworkers are in the same area and you already have closer bonds from knowing them in-person so even over video it seems a bit more fun Well over time workers will come and go and fewer and fewer new hires will be "local" to you Though you will have social "zoom meetings" it just wont have the same impact For the past 6 years Ive worked either remotely or with a large part of the team being remote so COVID wasnt the start of this for me As Ive noticed almost nobody keeps in touch after changing jobs from these remote teams Apart from perhaps a reference for a job application there is little to zero contact No long term friendships no long term anything Sure sometimes when someone would move to a new job you might chat quite a bit talk about things but usually those fizzle to zero rather quickly However I have plenty of friends held for decades gained from working together in person We still go out to hang talk over voice and chat play online and in-person games grab some drinks or see a show Those remote people on the "Chicago Team" of a job from five years ago I struggle to remember their names now Long term this will probably damage cities and urban centers Think the rise of the automobile and massive efficient highways created suburban sprawl? Hold your beer for the new WFH economy The continent will likely become coast to coast suburbs with neighbors with tall fences who hardly know each other Its okay you can watch movies in your home You can watch sports in your home You can see concerts in your home You can have your groceries delivered Fine dining some driving service will bring you food from that local restaurant if it really exists Perhaps Taco Bell now? Welcome to your home your prison I cant wait for the downvotes here I can almost smell them Of course some of what I am saying might not completely come to be but without a doubt its a strong possibility I guarantee this first taste of 100% remote working seems great now but long term the unintended consequences have not been fully considered And by the time those consequences are more strongly realized it would probably be impossible to go back to the office or at least a long uphill battle,RedditRage,16296866320,2

h3yaqxw,ocwhp4,Im glad this is here because I didnt want to post and I cant So here is the thing before the pandemic I had asthma an issue I had struggled with all my life and more I constantly got sick starting usually with colds then respiratory infections walking neumona chronic sinus infections all of this before ultimately getting better and slowly starting the same cycle all over again from year to year with varying degrees of severity fluctuating throughout my life After 2020 specifically January or maybe December year previous I had come back home to Oregon because I was chronically ill and unable to eat food I had gone from 220lb to just 147 in two months That issue is still on going I only mention it to make known that I had previously been in a failed physical state as well prior to the outbreak When the outbreak occurred it did so in Hillsboro Oregon the city we lived in at the time and we had already been sick all of us with respiratory issues Something were all well familiar with and more and equipped to deal with it since it runs in the family It passed like nothing for my family but I as per usual began my long cycle starting with the initial cold step; however when it came to the respiratory infection step everything changed In the past my mucus at this point would be thick heavy and brown and it would make it extremely difficult and painful for me to remove it by force namely deliberately coughing it all up over and over again until all of it for that day was gone and then sleep rinse repeat until fully recovered people I am poor as SHIT! When its your whole Life! You find a way Anyways I got to that step but this time my mucus had changed It was now white like histamine light stringy and sticky This made it near impossible to cough out The only reason my method had worked in the past was because it was near solid when brown and I could use the muscles around my lungs to forcefully eject the solid mass once it had built to a certain level Now as right now it just stays as a light presence in my lungs but at that time I tried wildly to eject it to the point that I may have either dislocated my collar bone documented as having been dislocated as a child or my shoulder I dont know for sure I tried and failed but its ok I was for reasons I wont get into examined against my will at a hospital some time after these events and they cleared me as never having had the corona virus subsequently released from unmentioned hospital Since that time my mucus has not gone back to the way it was and Ive not gotten any colds sinus infections none of it I started gaining my weight back more my muscle is rebuilding with very little effort and I have not changed my diet I eat virtually nothing and I mean that I am daily on a starvation diet My wife currently is trying to follow me she is at 114lb meanwhile eating less than she does I currently am just under 180lb I ate steak two days ago I virtually only eat meat these days Here is what I know Prior to the outbreak I was withering and I had been fighting respiratory issues my whole life despite making more than the usual effort to maintain my health through rigorous diet and exercise which had wained in the last three years leading up due to family a child full time work and marital stress Currently I am demonstrably better No changes to my diet since 2019 which consist of regular daily fasting only drinking milk sometimes mixed with peanut butter and a banana once or twice daily and occasionally red meat and sea life No changes to my family whom I still continue to struggle with daily weighting heavily on my psyche Ive been out of work since 2019 so that has not changed but things overall in my family and my living situation has improved Nevertheless the bigger factory being diet has not changed but my mucus has Im writing this while caring for my eight month old son one of two so spare me some consideration here if youre still reading lol in conclusion I got better after the pandemic and although I was told I had not been infected I believe that I was and I also believe that Ive overall as a life form become stronger as a result Im changing physically and physiologically for my betterment and that makes me genuinely wonder if vaccinating myself against these possible natural dangers is not the wrong way to go?

h97cgpe,p5gzct,Serious question only because its happened to me beforeIll preface this by saying Im vaccinated I got terribly sick while eating at a restaurant a few years ago and had to run into the bathroom toempty my stomach Will they allow the unvaccinated inside - with masks- to use the restroom? Or will people be forced to vomit outside in the unvaccinated section lol,EddiePeePeeMarshall,16291462250,7
h98n15h,p5gzct,I say do it It sucks for people physically unfit for the vaccine but it benefits them too in the long term we shouldnt want another two or three years of this shit just because people wont get vaccinated,RexDraco,16291667750,1
h98j3w4,p5gzct,"I dont want the vaccine because I dont know the long term effects" Yet the irony of this? The vast majority of people either drink tons of alcohol smoke weed smoke cigarettes pop molly and ecstasy take untested growth supplements and/or eat tons of processed unhealthy artery clogging junk foods But yeahdont trust the one thing that actively significantly mitigates the chances of death because of the off chance that one day 20 years in the future youll pee blue urine on a Sunday as your "side effect" #getvaccinatedyoumorons,azalin77,16291649380,0
h97luoc,p5gzct,So Im prepared to get downvoted but just to preface this statement keep in mind im vaccinated and i have been playing ball and completely get the need for caution But with the vaccine we are supposed to be safe from covid yeah? Like We can still get it but similar to say a flu shot it isnt as likely and nowhere near as dangerous Now im being told that the delta variant makes the vaccine virtually useless so we are back to square one Im getting real tired trying to explain to the anti mask folks i live around that the vaccine is the way to go when i turn around and see that it might not work at all i have been kept away from going out and enjoying myself for almost 2 years now missed out on having a 21st birthday party and am getting real frustrated with everything Sorry for the rant but i have been playing ball this whole time and now im being told just as everything gets back to normal that we are back to square one and to return to existing by myself and continue avoiding other humans This isnt living am i crazy to rather risk my life and continue living life than stay in hiding? I know this stuff is serious and im not trying to be some psycho anti-mask anti-vax weirdo im just really frustrated that i have lost so much of my life and now im being told it was all for naught,ndelte7,16291499730,1

hmvcllm,r6ejmd,Kinda makes sense omicron is more virulent (it seems) but less severe It has always been my impression that a virus "wants" to be less severe and more virulent After all a dead host cant spread a virus (or at least in any significant manner compared to a living virus factory) or make more viral particles A milder but longer last infection allows more virus to be made and to spread further This is what Ive picked up on over the years though so I maybe way off This could be the first signs of Covid becoming more akin to the flu,SonderEber,16384063050,2
hmtmnrx,r6ejmd,Lmao they know little to nothing about the OG covid 19 virus throw in mutations and it is a constant cycle of trying to catch up Alot of knowledge is coming from past experiences with coronaviruses but thats a very basic understanding that doesnt account for adaptations/mutation If they had an actual knowledge of what truly works with preventing or atleast decreasing symptoms we wouldnt be on shot #4 in a years time And before everyone says Im against vaccinations Im not However I will always be skeptical about any type of meds that are authorized for emergency use Time and results over the longterm will determine true effectiveness (And not saying we will but could just as easily find out that THIS vaccination COULD be doing more harm than good to our bodies) Tiny tidbit: my mother tested positive for Covid now 4-5 times hospitalized 3 of those times all in the past year (She has had all shots and boosters) kind of leads me to believe in a lack of effectiveness or I suppose false diagnosis (She is not only one I know just the closest to me that has tested positive and been hospitalized multiple times,Puzzleheaded-Yard891,16383815520,1

gud2as2,mpzwzj,For those of us reading this because we literally just got the J&J shot: 3 weeks with no issues and we are good to go? Do these clots happen more frequently on the front end and risk goes away with time? Or 2 years from now Im eating a sandwich and get a blood clot? Any way to know?,chuck543540,16183162790,9
gufb9d0,mpzwzj,Although I understand the concern its very possible this is a statistically normal phenomenon Heres some math to consider: The incidence of clots in women on oral contraceptives is 03%-1% over 10 years There are about 65 million women age 18-50 in the US About 14% are on the pill That means at the high end of the range you could expect 24 women per day could get a clot (ie 9000000\*001/3650 = 24) If we assume the distribution of the JnJ vaccine wasnt demographically biased (which may not be the case but the data on it should be available) then 7000000\*65000000/330000000\*014 = 193000 were women age 18-48 on oral contraceptives This is about 214% of all women in that demographic So over the course of a month you would expect those women to be responsible for 00214\*24\*30 = 154 clots at the high end of the normal risk range and 46 at the low end of the range The actual reported number was 6 Even assuming 50% reporting this is well within the normal range And that doesnt even account for pregnant women who also have an increased risk of clots Running the numbers for 54 million pregnant women (at any given time) each with a 01% chance of developing a clot Therefore on any given day you could expect 5400000\*0001/280 = 193 pregnant women to experience a clot or 580 in the course of a month Now granted pregnant women may have been less likely to get the vaccine (although its reportedly safe during pregnancy) BUT lets ignore that potential bias for a minute and assume that 5400000/330000000\*7000000 = 115000 pregnant women got the vaccine in the last month Those women would be responsible for 115000/5400000\*580 = 124 additional clots over the course of that month So under totally regular circumstances it wouldnt be abnormal for 27 out of the 3500000 women in question to get a clot in a given month This leaves a lot of room for the potential effect of biases in these stats Its obviously critical to verify all this though so I understand why the CDC would want to shut things down while they delve into the data Hindsight is 20/20 but I would say its really not surprising this was the main adverse event that was reported Women age 18-48 have a very very low rate of sudden unexpected mortality due to an adverse clinical event Even though the survival rate for a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is 95% that 5% is a significant number for individuals who are otherwise totally healthy Id be willing to bet its one of the top sudden physiological causes of mortality in the demographic in question Glancing at the data for the AstraZeneca vaccine it seems very similar Im curious -- have no patients who got the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines experienced clots?

Absolutely not! Weve been saying things like "Wear masks they arent perfect but every little bit helps" "Skip christmas every little bit helps" "get vaccinated every little bit helps"and then we turn around say "You know what nevermind everyone come on back to work even though we KNOW some of you will STILL be contagious" Funny how only individuals are asked to sacrifice to make every little bit help,Krytan,16416687040,9

"Its not sustainable or affordable to buy every person on the planet a new car each year" Regardless hard to believe that this wouldnt be a solvable problem Especially with variants more likely to come from unvaccinated populations (in poorer countries) theres a huge incentive to build out vaccination infrastructure I wonder how perceptions will change in the future Theres a lot of frustrated "Im done with this" comments in this thread which is fair enough I guess but for me personally if it were a 15 minute errand each year to get a booster / update and mitigate some of the risk of getting covid I cant imagine why I wouldnt do that Ive been getting the flu shot for years Even if it were just a mild reduction in the chances of contracting a mild illness I would still do that,pseudont,16413323950,0

hqripxf,rt54vc,TLDR; If youre using an antigen at-home rapid test wait until 2-3 days after symptom onset (but quarantine before then ofc) Family of 4 (50M 14F 16F 22F (myself)) We were exposed to COVID either on Christmas or the 26th (a close family friend (50Ms girlfriends son 15M with whom he was in the car with for 3+hours on the 26th) had a fever on the 26th confirmed positive PCR test on the 28th) Weve been quarantining since the 26th Day 0: 50M 16F and I took a QuickVue antigen test on the 28th They were all negative At this point 50M had a scratchy throat and was mildly coughing The rest of us had no symptoms I started getting a tickly throat (that feeling of "oh here it comes") late at night Didnt test 14F that night because the tests arent cheap :) and we were quarantining anyways At this point if one of us had it the rest of us did Day 1: The next morning 14F woke up with a fever Myself and 16F woke up with sore throats a headache fatigue and coughing 50M stayed the same I felt pretty rough that night had intense night-sweats and lots more coughing 14F broke her fever half-way through the day Day 2: 14F and 16F are feeling much better! Yay! Hardly any symptoms just mild coughing and runny nose I have worse coughing fatigue scratchy throat runny nose nausea 50M doing pretty much the same as he was--just a scratchy throat and coughing At this point its just been a bad cold for us or akin to a case of bronchitis We all took more at-home tests: 2 QuickVue 2 BinaxNOW All 4 came back positive Day 3 (today): 50M lost his sense of smell dampened sense of taste This didnt happen during his first run with COVID (April 2020) Still has similar symptoms but theyve gotten better Im doing much better still occasionally coughing & headaches/cold symptoms 14F and 16F are practically symptom-free now just a bit of coughing 14F and 16F were 2x Pfizer vaccinated in June 2021 (date of second dose) 50M was 2x Moderna vaccinated in January 2021 but caught COVID early-on from hospital work in April 2020 Was a fairly severe case lasted 15 months but no hospitalization I was vaccinated 2x Pfizer in April 2021 None of us received the booster yet I think we all caught Omicron as the symptoms are relatively mild 14F 16F and I have never had COVID before A bit sad we caught it after 2 years of not catching it 50M isnt as cautious with masking/avoiding crowded areas procedures as we are Some anecdotal evidence if you will We all tested negative the first round of testing and all tested positive the second round of testing So you may want to wait until 2-3 days after the start of symptoms before you do an at-home test Best of luck to everyone!

h66pzxv,opi0xh,I was partying in Nashville last weekend When we booked it it was a "we beat COVID party!" But flash forward to our arrival and stuff has been getting bad again Especially bad in Tennessee I saw some troubling headlines but we decided fuck it Were not gonna not party So we did and we did it harder than in the last 2 years Random girl wants to make out? Done Dancing way too close to people? Check Drinking a Corona from a bartender who totally put her lime in my drink with the same hand she grabbed my cash? Yup! All in baby I came home and when I woke up on Monday I had an awful cold I had read a story about someone saying if youre vaxxed and you have a cold its possibly COVID I was paranoid So I got a rapid test right away Negative But fuck that I want to make sure sure So I got the longer 24-72 test By Tuesday I felt fine It turns out it was just allergies Going from a hyper clean AirBnB to my house which is Im comparison kinda dusty kicked my ass I also forgot to take my nasal spray the day before But I still wanted that negative test And I got it yesterday (47 hours after I got tested) Negative again So I got absurdly lucky Either I interacted with someone with COVID and the vaccine did a kickass job or I got even luckier and in a COVID hot spot I didnt bump into COVID at all I will say that any girls I hooked up and managed to actually talk to (about half) were out of towners from liberal states and all got the vaccine Anyway the vaccine (PFIZER) I got helped me feel like I wasnt in peril I have asthma so Im sure COVID would do a number on my lungs I dont think it will kill me probably especially with the vaccine but any further lung damage would be life changing I just stopped needing an inhaler within the last 5 or so years Is there a point to this way way too long message? Just that I felt like the vaccine would help me And Im pretty sure it did It was a gamble for sure but also a mental thing I think me and all my friends really needed 88% is damn good odds PS Nashville is fucking awesome Its like a 3-1 ratio girls to guys Its like Tinder but in real life and you have such a better shot with every girl out there When everything is cool again (assuming it ever is) check it out Edit: firstly shame a positive vaccine story gets downvoted here but fine Guess I wont be defending this shit anymore Good luck,PeterDarker,16269960890,-3

The Corona Cabinet approved: Insulation for returnees from abroad African variant Omicron (Photo: Reuters) South Africa has transferred new information to Israel - and this is the data | Photo: Reuters The contradictory messages of vaccine manufacturers The test of the effectiveness of existing vaccines against the new variant was in its infancy but Modern CEO Stefan Bensel managed to arouse global concern today when he said in an interview with the Financial Times that he expects a significant decrease in vaccine efficacy But Bensel spoke of a decline in benefit from a disease with symptoms rather than a serious illness - a difference that is known to be dramatic in corona contexts as Pfizer CEO Albert Burla was apt to describe: Defense compared to Delta but that would be the limit In both cases the booster vaccines are expected to reduce the gap dramatically " Burla who promised to know more about the benefits of the vaccine against the variant in about a week and a half said Pfizer had already begun developing a specific vaccine against the variant a few days ago "We know the genetic linkage of the virus we have it - thats how it starts" he explained "We started at risk to produce a vaccine We actually started on Friday to produce a vaccine based on the flooring the DNA template that would allow us to make RNA that would eventually women within that vaccine" Israel meanwhile is waiting for a more categorical statement from the two CEOs and meanwhile relies on data coming from South Africa - where the variant was first discovered - and from which it appears that the omicron is more contagious but is no more violent "Data on the benefits of the vaccine - there may be some partial data from South Africa" Dr Sharon Elrai-Price head of public health services said today during a debate in the Knesset I know they are doing the lab tests as I described to see how useful the vaccine against this variant is " Bennett worried: "There is a lot of uncertainty" Albert Burla and Naftali Bennett (Adapted by Reuters) Burla optimistic Bennett explains why he activated the GSS | Arrangement: Reuters At the same time the government is today approving a memorandum of law that will allow it to extend the decision to allow the GSS to verify the cellular devices of those infected with Omicron or the suspects who were infected with it with high probability - in order to interrupt the transmission chains as quickly as possible But just before the move reaches the Knesset the coalition itself is sharply critical of the law Prime Minister Bennett - who saw for himself how in the ministers WhatsApp groups Ministers Saar Shasha-Bitton Barbibai and Avidar voted against - told today why Israel decided to include the GSS in the campaign despite and perhaps because it is a low number of infected "There is a lot of uncertainty and that is why we are taking these extreme measures" he said in a video call with Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schlenberg "But our advantage as leaders is that once we know more when there is more information - we can let go of those measures gradually" As for the restrictions at Ben Gurion Airport the prime minister has already decided that these will last about two weeks from the date of the decision - and only if the final proof does come that the variant does not endanger the populations immunity or the omicron is already spread in the community - these restrictions will be removed Yaron Avraham participated in the preparation of the article,Serenity101,16383425550,2

When H1N1 was a thing I was working 3 afternoons a week at a high school and DAMN I had classes where students were constantly going to the bathroom to puke their guts out 1/4-1/3 of the students were clearly effected I constantly encouraged them to go home but they didnt see it as an option because their teachers and parents didnt accept the practice of saying home to get better and not risk spreading their illness to others A few years later I had a kid come to school looking kinda sick and before class I asked the girls mother and she upright admitted that she was aware that her child was infected with FMD which can be extremely fatal to humans who are younger/have less developed immune systems I couldnt believe this woman I informed my co-workers of the situation We immediately locked all of the classrooms because we didnt want anyone in the other classrooms to get infected It literally took over an hour to convince the mother to take her child out of the school It was literally impossible to convince her that shed done something wrong by taking her child outside let alone to a school filled with other younglings She attempted to fight the manager when we told her that she wouldnt be able to bring her child back into the school without proof from a local hospital that her daughter was no longer contagious After the insane woman left we spent a few hours sanitizing everything in the school It must have been a weird experience for the kids and teachers in the other classrooms They normally would have finished class a long time ago and would have been let out of the classroom for breaks but they had to just hang out in the classroom while we insured that wed done our best to make sure it was safe for the kids to come out TBH we shouldnt have had anything to do with this process There should have been some division of the government to contact to have them ensure that this is done properly especially given how this disease is famous for coming through areas and taking the lives of children in waves but yeah we didnt have such a luxury at our disposal COVID wasnt nearly as bad The government had clearly learned from SARS and figured out a way to deal with it in their own way After the COVID lockdown had ended it was really nice to see so many kids come to class wearing masks I even had co-workers wearing masks when they had a cold which is something I couldnt have imagined happening ever before COVID COVID really made me question why the hell we havent been wearing masks when under the weather all of these years I think it should be a given You shouldnt be free to spread your germs when youre feeling ill just regardless of whether or not you live in a free country,ThaddCorbett,16387743750,13

hfkfxux,q2ckda,The creation of a second class citizen group based on medical choice is a fascinating philosophical question that I dont think people are taking very seriously at the moment At the moment for most people this situation seems very cut and dry: "Get vaccine which helps you & others or else suffer the consequences" There are many good public health reasons to encourage vaccination - both via carrots and sticks However moving this premise out 20- 30- 50 years from now as technology advances would we feel comfortable with the same principles applying to other medical interventions? If we discovered a way (gattaca-style) to make some genetic tweaks that ensured a person would be at a much reduced chance for disease transfer in the future -- would that be okay to mandate (or deny services to that person if they didnt receive the genetic tweak)? Maybe so Maybe as society/ technology changes its entirely fine to mandate such things Its just an interesting philosophical question that I think we arent giving full consideration to yet,paro54,16334942450,126

h8f0php,p1oqh4,Its no shocker to me A lot of my family and friends live in Florida Back in late June i went down to surprise my father for his 69th birthday I thought since I was fully vaccinated and cases were at their lowest since the start of the pandemic there was never going to be a better time to go I hadnt seen him in 10 years I wasnt sure I would see him again so I took the risk and drove down This trip was highly unusual Normally I would get in contact with everyone and try to spend time with as many people as I could This was more a top secret mission Ive been paying attention to everyones social media posts I knew since i had a high risk son at home there were many folks I did not want to see (He has heart failure one kidney and immuno-compromised from a cancer diagnosis as a toddler)The need to know list was minimal Even though neither of my parents are vaccinated I knew it was ok to visit my father He is living off the system and had most things delivered at his home He only left to buy cigarettes and beer and got them at a window I asked my mom to get tested because she hasnt changed her way of living since all this started Anti masker bible thumping Christian who goes to church and Costco twice a week This church sets aside a half hour after service for fellowship community dining and affection(hugging and spreading love) I visited a handful of friends One group knew i was coming down before anyone else They all were fully vaccinated and quarantined themselves before I arrived Chatting with them made me realize that most Floridians just dont care about following the rules Its always been business as usual down there Theres been major events like concerts live DJ performances and parties weekly Ive seen tons of posts from packed venues Nobody wearing masks all crammed tightly in a building One night I visited my best friend since high school We got to chat while smoking a fat bowl (she bought a new piece just for me for my visit) and she said it perfectly "Florida just dont give a fuck about Covid" Its that frame of mind why Florida will be hit mega hard by this variant Theres a huge number of unvaccinated people down there You have the younger crowd partying like its 1999 mixing with a massive older retired population A recipe for disaster Even with this new variant and numbers skyrocketing they still just dont care With Summer coming to a close soon all of the snowbirds will start arriving again Just in time as the Delta is getting in gear I probably shouldnt have taken the drive down or seen as many people as I did But like I said cases were at their lowest and most of the small number of people I visited were vaccinated I caught a lot of flak once everyone found out I was down and never stopped in Those that knew I was coming also knew the situation with my son and took precaution Most of the time spent together was outdoors and distanced at a persons home The only home I went in was my Fathers I knew it was only a matter of time before a new variant swept through the Sunshine State Im glad I went when I did My dad is a chain smoker and ex hardcore drug addict I never once seen him eat when i was there Beer and cigarettes thats it Didnt matter if it was 8 in the morning or midnight Alcohol and nicotine If you heard him cough you would know he doesnt have much time left on Earth I had to go down to see him when the opportunity was there,ac1dre1gn77,16286075150,97

h8fv8hj,p1oqh4,There are two factors at play here: * Floridas state ban on school mask mandates * Increased Transmission from Delta There have been some [pretty robust](https://wwwnytimescom/2021/08/10/opinion/covid-schools-maskshtml) [studies](https://abcsciencecollaborativeorg/report-shows-that-n-c-k-12-schools-reopened-safely-paving-the-way-for-schools-nationwide-to-limit-covid-19-spread-in-the-classroom/) that show that at least for last years variants in-person education had very low transmission rates so long as everyone was wearing masks So the question is how much of this transmission is due to students not masking and how much is due to the increased transmission rate of the Delta variant? As the parent of kids who are in a school district thats headed back to in-person-with-masks-required school in a few weeks my hope is that masks are still effective enough to allow for safe in-person learning until under-12s can get vaccinated But we really dont know that yet If my kids were headed back to school tomorrow with the data we have available today in an environment where masks are required Id likely send them with N95 masks But well see what things look like in a few weeks when I have to make that decision for realsies,AtOurGates,16286203390,3

hl0mlwa,qw0f3o,said this in another thread but got no replies maybe someone will discuss here i wonder what the history of some of our current 3+ series vaccines are (mmr etc) when they first came out its likely the perfect regimen wasnt ironed out the first year of distribution its not fun to be the ones to have to "fuck around and find out" re: how long and well our current vaccines last but i still have hope for more stability in the long term - studies may show that a much longer interval between the first doses is more optimal and thats what will be given to children going forward etc hopefully mutations will tamp down when the entire world has significantly more coverage (rn 50% of the entire world has 1 dose obviously lopsided af but not bad for less than a year out) hopefully itll stabilize to something like our current vaccines many of which have boosters 10 years out from a 2 or 3 part series or sooner if titers indicate its needed,curiosity676,16371731690,21
