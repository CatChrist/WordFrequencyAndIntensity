h7cho06,ovpxdj,According to the research being done especially in places like Israel that has a population over 60 at 80% vaccinated by February data is showing the vaccine effectiveness is fading quick and dramatically Had you been vaccinated in January such as myself youll find youre at best walking around with an effectiveness of nearly 20% compared to someone vaccinated in June who is around 80% If unvaccinated people are the only ones getting sick the concern we are seeing wouldnt be there You would be protected with your vaccination and would have little to worry about The truth is we will see more variants and until we have boosters available and ones that can be made quickly before the new variants take hold we will continue to see spikes regardless of previous vaccinations Instead we are seeing vaccinated people spreading the virus and some knowingly I know first hand someone who is currently infected after being vaccinated in april and she continues to work at her job since the symptoms arent bad according to her and she is vaccinated The anti vaxxers are a problem but theyre a distraction from the real issue that your vaccine will only provide so much protection and its not a ticket to do whatever you want If the vaccine worked effectively for the current delta variant they would only be their own problem Kind of like driving a car with a seatbelt The direct impact is only to the individual I have and still continue to wear two masks including an n95 as well as limit my public interactions It isnt hard to wear a mask its not hard to use common sense even if youre vaccinated Weve had a hospital in my metropolitan area that had 20% of the admitted covid patients fully vaccinated It all depends on when your state started doing vaccines and how long ago it had been since you got yours And we will see a lot more of these so called "breakthrough" cases regardless of vaccination rates And government officials have been warned already of this and the CDC has discussed this internally and a lot of people are concerned about the effectiveness of the vaccines The mask mandate should have never been removed and local governments have also failed their constituents,mrnight8,16278464230,1
h7cw6ro,ovpxdj,The Israeli Prime Minister stated *"We do not know exactly to what degree the vaccine helps[vs Delta] but it is significantly less"* due to a rise in new and serious cases among vaccinated people *"The highest number of coronavirus cases in nearly four months"* It also affects children who are mostly unvaccinated so we need to get them vaccinated perhaps with an updated booster shot before its too late Over half their population is fully vaccinated and among everyone *"around 60% of the patients in serious conditions have been vaccinated Moreover according to Hebrew University researchers who advise the government around 90% of newly infected people over the age of 50 are fully vaccinated"* So the vaccine IS HELPING these statistics PROVE THAT but they also prove that the Delta Variant is not to be taken lightly and that a new vaccine MUST be developed to combat this deadly mutation,Candaianmann,16278533780,1
h7d2sme,ovpxdj,My country has decided not to do the vaccine passport but still offers some papers which serve as proof I think a company could step to the table and create a scannable hard to counterfeit vaccine passport with integrity behind it I normally would prefer government to do these (essential) things over companies but if they wont why not let a 3rd party do it? I get this isnt great for personal liberties (though we use to require people to show immunization records to get into school or enter the country) and we should keep an eye on the government so that things dont stick past the pandemic (like with the NSA and their anti-terrorism measures) but like most people I take this pandemic seriously and just want it to be over I dont believe in forcing people to take the shot with force (unless the virus was more deadly and Martial Law was declared) but restricting them from public places is good encouragement and helps keep immuno-compromised people and others who cant get vaccinated for medical reasons safe,Beeker93,16278566340,1

I guess this isnt really that big of an issue if Moderna is probably getting full approval soon but still curious,str1kebeam,16297415590,1

Does the anticipated decrease in hospitalizations outweigh the potential decrease in the labor force? Consider also the compounding effects of a labor shortage ( yes I know its actually a wage shortage) on the already fractured supply chain Additionally how much benefit will we actually see from this mandate if (when) a vaccine resistant variant of covid begins to dominate?

gv3sguz,mtzjkn,I hope that the reason why we are moving at such a quick pace is that a significant amount of people are not going to get vaccinated by a still in trials vaccine So the government now has millions of vaccines but not enough people willing to take then so they keep on lowering the threshold Unless I missed something it was supposed to take months as the vaccine producers already had everything set up for different countries and their supply chain was at a limit,trolololoz,16188536060,-12
gw80t1q,n0j4gg,I honestly think the biggest thing here is that we really need a school system that teaches critical thinking and problem solving I used to listen to that podcast quite a bit but was tapering off a lot before it went over to spotify (which killed it to for me entirely) I felt like there was a fair amount of honest discussion and points were brought up that I wouldnt think of myself There was also plenty of stuff I completely disagree with Theres also a ton of banter and half cocked joke ideas I dont listen anymore so really dont know or care how this particular podcast went The real problem is that people are so devoid of the ability to think critically that they cant evaluate a statement its context and whether its coming from a place primarily of opinion vs research etc If it is given as actual advice does it actually make sense? Who are the guests? Are they experts what credentials do they have who do they work for are they bro-ing it up by bullshitting/bantering on a podcast or are they seriously describing their field of study? Are they trying to make themselves look good? Etc etc If Joe Rogan (or anyone else expert or otherwise) looks you in the eyes and seriously tells you something like "Cigarettes arent bad for you its all government propaganda" I would hope you have enough going on in your head to think to yourself "hey that probably isnt right" Maybe dont live your life by that advice just yet This is true of people who both love and hate this podcast There were plenty of instances where something was said that people heavily criticized that were clearly off the cuff remarks or jokes Theres also things that were said with authority and under the guise of expertise that were flat out incorrect or misinformed Taking a celebrity as the end all of where you get advice from is a terrible idea Even statements coming from experts are usually worth internalizing and thinking about but also checking up on and doing a bit of research for what the general consensus is and how it applies to your unique circumstance,cheapseats91,16196457420,58

My point is the officers exercised out search iron their own discretion not with procedure Off topic but in California a lawyer (in law) and his family refuse to get vaccinated or wear a mask My wife was a masker but hesitant to get the vaccine but she finally did Her mother is suspicious of her now My point is if educated (lawyer and my wifes brother (98% sat score)) are anti ) I have no clue about human behavior Japanese immigration and other countries exercise broad flexibility in my experience Highly educated US individuals and high IQ individuals are anti vaccine This is my personal experience with these people It could just be isolated incidents,DavidNipondeCarlos,16206699590,1

Because that could mean that hospitalizations will still rise in Omicron dominant areas Locally our Omicron is increasing fast as well as our daily positive cases but so far hospitalizations are fine The New Year will be the big indicator I think Were getting tons of free home test kits from the Canadian government for Christmas gatherings at least which will keep some asymptomatic omicron cases home and away from vulnerable parents/grandparents,Mike-Hawks,16401912610,1

ha04grb,p9dd93,This is something I suggested to my company in the UK: Hi folks Ive given some consideration to this and would like to suggest the below rules to satisfy a flexible work offering to the SD: I have based this on: 23 SD staff (8x 24/7 engineers 15x Core shift) Image Image Image Each engineer must come in 40% of their time Each day there must be at least 5 people physically on rotad shift Each day there must be no more than 10 engineer on schedule We split the WFH days in any given week between a choice of Monday+Tuesday or Thursday+Friday This grants opportunity of "extended weekend feeling" to all Q: Why 40% submission to physical occupation? A: TeamLead stated Service Desk requires an obligatory 15% physical office presence on any working day Q: How does this impact skill availability? A: It doesnt this is based purely on resource as we have availability across core teams in the working week On average we will have 8 engineers physically within the office space Q: How this is managed? A: Either by a scheduling app/portal where engineers self-sign up (first come first serve) and commit to fulfilling their weekly hours or assigned by TLs Q: How does this solution address 24/7 flexibility? A: Whilst 24/7 day shift must attend the office space 24/7 night shift fulfil duties from home Any 24/7 day shift falling on a weekend is fulfilled from home This is open to your adjustments or leave as is in the pot for discussion and practical application for the business Thanks" Glad to say this has now been adopted  Before COVID happened my company was on target to turn 200m so they purchased a new HQ for 15m We are an IT Managed Service Provider The company had plans to go global looking for offices in the USA They signed the contract grace period passed and then COVID happened They were unable to back out of the deal and have since been working within regulations of UK lockdowns and government guidance to continue with the new head office plan We have lost only 1 employee during this pandemic and that was after he contracted Covid after major surgery Work load has increased the employment demand at our company due to demand from clients working remotely and other IT projects Due to Covid theyve put the expansion on the back burner for now and are cautiously monitoring markets and of course Covid itself They still want to expand to the US Fingers crossed!  As we have hospitals and government clients for technical support we were actually classed as support workers and got full 80% furlough offered but we didnt need to take it Covid has just sped up the work from home culture and those that do not change their ways are set to lose good employees Mental health has been cited as one of the major drivers with a large majority of workers being effected I personally have been wfh social distancing and wearing a mask in public since 2019 when my wife started chemotherapy after a mastectomy So this has been the norm for us long before Covid came along I do think there is a need for a physical space a lot of clients say the office is a place to separate home and work life Ive never had this as an issue in fact I am blessed that I have seen my son grow up since his birth in 2019 I get to spend time playing with him look after my wife and be home "on time" or work late if I want to An hour here and there longer doesnt kill me in fact I believe I start earlier and finish on time or happy to work later I think sales people need that physical connection and banter with their colleagues its the nature of that beast I know from a lot of clients and other companies I interviewed for that WFH was a massive positive to performance and output but over time people have got complacent or lazy and now efficiency is actually on the back slide WFH is definitely here to stay to what degree and capacity offered is another thing Ps feel free to use my wfh flexible working plan ,PrimarisBA,16296996010,1

Hospitals are full no ICU beds Here in upstate NY we sometimes wait 3 to 4 HOURS outside the hospital with the patient in the ambulance because there are no beds in the ER And while we are waiting we cannot respond to other calls that come in People will die in this scenario from injuries or medical issues that were treatable And that makes me angry Not sure who to blame Government anti-vaxxers anti-maskers businesses that dont enforce rules the list seems endless But watching a patient die in the back of an ambulance 100 feet from the ER doors because there is no capacity to provide care is something I dont wish on anyone,IronScaggs,16413923930,8260

What this also doesnt take into consideration are variants In certain counties which they curiously picked but I probably would have too in my study there is no differentiator for variants We are already seeing strong real world data showing that many of the vaccines are very ineffective against the D variant originally discovered in India Indias numbers have plummeted but there are widespread reports of falsification of data there so much like Chinas reporting I dont think we can trust that this will just disappear I think the UK is our canary in the coalmine at this point so early into the emergence of this variant There are many folks like myself that just simply dont trust the science behind so much of what has occurred since day 1 of this modern day plague Being allergic to PEG to the point that using shampoo with it causes a mild rash I was told not to take the current offerings and wait for better news to come out for the J/J But all we hear from them is bad news between blood clots and corrupted vials in the millions I feel like the entire globe especially reddit users would like to over simplify vaccines and how to stop this disease Remember the idea of a manufactured disease was laughed at and even censored on these very forums not too long ago Now both sides of the political spectrum are realizing there was an orchestrated cover up by Peter Daszak So what new discoveries will there be about the variants the effectiveness claims of the current vaccines against the new variants and long term effects of the vaccine that lets not forget were originally slated for emergency FDA clearance for older and immune compromised individuals because the potential risk of the vaccine far outweighed the potential risk of covid which for those in that category was a very strong chance of death or at a minimum a painful long possibly perpetual recovery period Harvard and Yale doctors came out together and said there is no reason to vaccinate the young the risks are unknown and the risk of covid for those is also low: [https://wwwmsncom/en-us/health/medical/harvard-stanford-doctors-say-mandating-the-coronavirus-vaccine-unethical/vi-AALbqNq?ocid=entnewsntp&pc=U531](https://wwwmsncom/en-us/health/medical/harvard-stanford-doctors-say-mandating-the-coronavirus-vaccine-unethical/vi-AALbqNq?ocid=entnewsntp&pc=U531) Heres my problem with their statements though As someone pointed out the effectiveness of the vaccines are high and your risk of having a break through case drops dramatically if others are also vaccinated Younger people have been known to be asymptomatic and as such are more likely to spread it as younger people are generally more social in person than older people I dont have the answers but to try and paint this as a black/white conversation is foolish I hope the vaccinated dont have long term health issues but if they did you could bet they wouldnt come back on these forums and apologize to those of us that cant get the current vaccines or are fearful because our scientists and medical community especially our government has shown to be at best a bit inept confused and politically motivated,HyprSl0th,16240387040,0

h828k8x,ozr842,Im my mind the only reasonable argument to be made for vaccine mandates is to avoid overwhelming hospitals with sick people I dont think its the governments job to protect people from themselves unless that harm also creates a negative externality for others (like not getting treated for other conditions when all the ICU beds are fill with Covid patients) That said I think many who support mandates are operating on the false assumption that these vaccines are sterilizing or offer enough protection to fully prevent the spread of the virus from vaccinated persons If the virus can still spread whats the point? Also how long before mandated vaccines drop further in efficacy (of preventing spread)? And what does am enforcement regime look like when the science is constantly updating and bureaucracy is slow to adjust?,DavenportBlues,16283483930,3

hmrq413,r5ueps,I dont see an English option (on mobile page) so I ran the article through Google translate: Preliminary data: The vaccine protects highly effectively against the new variant Marciano Foundation The information received in Israel about the Omicron - the good and bad news: After Bennetts declaration of "state of emergency" in Israel tonight received preliminary data - both from South Africa and Europe - on the new variant that is causing concern around the world The data revealed tonight (Tuesday) in the "main edition" shortly after being received in Israel are preliminary - but indicate that the vaccine is still effective against the newly discovered mutations The data were collected in both South Africa and European countries where verifications were found in the new variant It should be emphasized that these are preliminary data that the whole world is waiting for and at this point they become the working assumption According to these data the effectiveness of the vaccine (for those who received three doses ie also the booster) decreases only slightly: 90% protection compared to 95% protection against the Delta strain These are impressive and somewhat reassuring figures The effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing serious illness for those who have been vaccinated three times is the same as the effectiveness against the Delta strain - the strain that has been the most dominant in Israel so far The alarming data But not everything is rosy: the problems start with the risk of recovering from being infected The data show that the risk of recovering from infection is twice as high as in Delta and the rate of infection is 13 times higher than in Delta This rate of infection is very high: in South Africa there is talk that in 15 days the number of patients has increased 15 times Although the numbers are low the rate is problematic and worrying: in Israel there are many Israelis who are not vaccinated Another worrying statistic has been revealed regarding the unvaccinated: their risk of becoming seriously ill is 24 times that of the original strain of the corona the one that arrived in Israel nearly two years ago In "unvaccinated" the reference is also to those vaccinated in two doses who are entitled to a booster and have not yet been vaccinated and therefore their protection is insufficient Despite this news the data is a reassuring siren when it comes to protecting vaccinated people from both serious illness and infection for further reading: South Africa to Israel: "Vaccine effective against Omicron variant" The Omicron variant captured the continent of Europe unprepared A new variant has been identified in Africa Will Ben Gurion Airport close because of the new variant? The Corona Cabinet approved: Insulation for returnees from abroad African variant Omicron (Photo: Reuters) South Africa has transferred new information to Israel - and this is the data | Photo: Reuters The contradictory messages of vaccine manufacturers The test of the effectiveness of existing vaccines against the new variant was in its infancy but Modern CEO Stefan Bensel managed to arouse global concern today when he said in an interview with the Financial Times that he expects a significant decrease in vaccine efficacy But Bensel spoke of a decline in benefit from a disease with symptoms rather than a serious illness - a difference that is known to be dramatic in corona contexts as Pfizer CEO Albert Burla was apt to describe: Defense compared to Delta but that would be the limit In both cases the booster vaccines are expected to reduce the gap dramatically " Burla who promised to know more about the benefits of the vaccine against the variant in about a week and a half said Pfizer had already begun developing a specific vaccine against the variant a few days ago "We know the genetic linkage of the virus we have it - thats how it starts" he explained "We started at risk to produce a vaccine We actually started on Friday to produce a vaccine based on the flooring the DNA template that would allow us to make RNA that would eventually women within that vaccine" Israel meanwhile is waiting for a more categorical statement from the two CEOs and meanwhile relies on data coming from South Africa - where the variant was first discovered - and from which it appears that the omicron is more contagious but is no more violent "Data on the benefits of the vaccine - there may be some partial data from South Africa" Dr Sharon Elrai-Price head of public health services said today during a debate in the Knesset I know they are doing the lab tests as I described to see how useful the vaccine against this variant is " Bennett worried: "There is a lot of uncertainty" Albert Burla and Naftali Bennett (Adapted by Reuters) Burla optimistic Bennett explains why he activated the GSS | Arrangement: Reuters At the same time the government is today approving a memorandum of law that will allow it to extend the decision to allow the GSS to verify the cellular devices of those infected with Omicron or the suspects who were infected with it with high probability - in order to interrupt the transmission chains as quickly as possible But just before the move reaches the Knesset the coalition itself is sharply critical of the law Prime Minister Bennett - who saw for himself how in the ministers WhatsApp groups Ministers Saar Shasha-Bitton Barbibai and Avidar voted against - told today why Israel decided to include the GSS in the campaign despite and perhaps because it is a low number of infected "There is a lot of uncertainty and that is why we are taking these extreme measures" he said in a video call with Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schlenberg "But our advantage as leaders is that once we know more when there is more information - we can let go of those measures gradually" As for the restrictions at Ben Gurion Airport the prime minister has already decided that these will last about two weeks from the date of the decision - and only if the final proof does come that the variant does not endanger the populations immunity or the omicron is already spread in the community - these restrictions will be removed Yaron Avraham participated in the preparation of the article,Serenity101,16383425550,2

hnflckn,r9otza,Ive been teaching in China for 18 years and this is par for the course Ill first say Ive always worked in the private sector and there have been times that Ive been outsourced to public schools on occasion while working with a few schools in the past What a gong show Not criticizing China Just humanity in general So I came **right** after the WHO lifted the SARS travel ban to China Id planned on moving to China earlier and SARS ended up delaying my departure by a few months There are always sick kids coming to school It really broke my heart Id see kids as young as 4 years old coming to class run down and sick It just made me think "if youre going to run your kid into the ground like this at this age what kind of physical condition can you expect them to be in when theyre 30?" When H1N1 was a thing I was working 3 afternoons a week at a high school and DAMN I had classes where students were constantly going to the bathroom to puke their guts out 1/4-1/3 of the students were clearly effected I constantly encouraged them to go home but they didnt see it as an option because their teachers and parents didnt accept the practice of saying home to get better and not risk spreading their illness to others A few years later I had a kid come to school looking kinda sick and before class I asked the girls mother and she upright admitted that she was aware that her child was infected with FMD which can be extremely fatal to humans who are younger/have less developed immune systems I couldnt believe this woman I informed my co-workers of the situation We immediately locked all of the classrooms because we didnt want anyone in the other classrooms to get infected It literally took over an hour to convince the mother to take her child out of the school It was literally impossible to convince her that shed done something wrong by taking her child outside let alone to a school filled with other younglings She attempted to fight the manager when we told her that she wouldnt be able to bring her child back into the school without proof from a local hospital that her daughter was no longer contagious After the insane woman left we spent a few hours sanitizing everything in the school It must have been a weird experience for the kids and teachers in the other classrooms They normally would have finished class a long time ago and would have been let out of the classroom for breaks but they had to just hang out in the classroom while we insured that wed done our best to make sure it was safe for the kids to come out TBH we shouldnt have had anything to do with this process There should have been some division of the government to contact to have them ensure that this is done properly especially given how this disease is famous for coming through areas and taking the lives of children in waves but yeah we didnt have such a luxury at our disposal COVID wasnt nearly as bad The government had clearly learned from SARS and figured out a way to deal with it in their own way After the COVID lockdown had ended it was really nice to see so many kids come to class wearing masks I even had co-workers wearing masks when they had a cold which is something I couldnt have imagined happening ever before COVID COVID really made me question why the hell we havent been wearing masks when under the weather all of these years I think it should be a given You shouldnt be free to spread your germs when youre feeling ill just regardless of whether or not you live in a free country,ThaddCorbett,16387743750,13

hy60eqb,szo1gx,But it is normal We have been spoiled the last 100 years with modern technology but death from disease ill include childbirth is very normal Early death is part of life most people never died of old age This is a normal human situation in fact 1 million or 03% is pretty low for the biggest disaster in 70 years Barely noticable most people dont know 250 people in their daily life so chance of knowing anyone who died is small COVID had no impact on peoples lives aside from the ridiculous overreaction measures from the government,leonard12daniels,16456585740,-1
