h7brc7u,ovpxdj,I hate that I feel this way but I am torn about masking up again in public and at work - not because I dont like wearing a mask I actually dont mind it and often forgot I had it on What I am dreading is the confrontations the anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers who will sneer and mock and the conversations with clients and coworkers who think its all a hoax The thing is the mask worn by me is for them its to protect them and their families who cant/wont get the damn shots Im torn because I dont want to unknowingly pass anything along that might sicken hospitalize and maybe kill someone who cannot get the shots but Im also very close to the point where I dont give a rats ass if someone who refuses to protect themselves gets sick and dies,bookofbob,16278340250,2

h7cho06,ovpxdj,According to the research being done especially in places like Israel that has a population over 60 at 80% vaccinated by February data is showing the vaccine effectiveness is fading quick and dramatically Had you been vaccinated in January such as myself youll find youre at best walking around with an effectiveness of nearly 20% compared to someone vaccinated in June who is around 80% If unvaccinated people are the only ones getting sick the concern we are seeing wouldnt be there You would be protected with your vaccination and would have little to worry about The truth is we will see more variants and until we have boosters available and ones that can be made quickly before the new variants take hold we will continue to see spikes regardless of previous vaccinations Instead we are seeing vaccinated people spreading the virus and some knowingly I know first hand someone who is currently infected after being vaccinated in april and she continues to work at her job since the symptoms arent bad according to her and she is vaccinated The anti vaxxers are a problem but theyre a distraction from the real issue that your vaccine will only provide so much protection and its not a ticket to do whatever you want If the vaccine worked effectively for the current delta variant they would only be their own problem Kind of like driving a car with a seatbelt The direct impact is only to the individual I have and still continue to wear two masks including an n95 as well as limit my public interactions It isnt hard to wear a mask its not hard to use common sense even if youre vaccinated Weve had a hospital in my metropolitan area that had 20% of the admitted covid patients fully vaccinated It all depends on when your state started doing vaccines and how long ago it had been since you got yours And we will see a lot more of these so called "breakthrough" cases regardless of vaccination rates And government officials have been warned already of this and the CDC has discussed this internally and a lot of people are concerned about the effectiveness of the vaccines The mask mandate should have never been removed and local governments have also failed their constituents,mrnight8,16278464230,1
h7clmli,ovpxdj,This is exactly where Im at Other than little kids anyone who wants the vaccine could get it by now even the poor (Im speaking of America I realize this is an international community) The fact that were doing the right thing and were still going to get punished by the dumbasses is unreasonable Never mind the fact that the entire point behind masking/shutdowns/etc is the stress on our public health system I live in a state that has currently ZERO strain on our system yet some CDC scientists are here to tell me that my 5 cases per 100k people is considered "high" and we should be masking indoors everywhere Our vaccinated kids? Masked 100% in school this fall - no option Its bullshit If you are a family that has a little one then wear your masks If I had a child under 12 my entire family would be masked right now anywhere indoors today - despite currently miniscule numbers However we dont so I dont feel its necessary to do so I wont raise a stink about masking rules that businesses want to put in place but unlike last year when I supported every single one of these mandatesthis year is different,islander1,16278483180,1

h7d2sme,ovpxdj,My country has decided not to do the vaccine passport but still offers some papers which serve as proof I think a company could step to the table and create a scannable hard to counterfeit vaccine passport with integrity behind it I normally would prefer government to do these (essential) things over companies but if they wont why not let a 3rd party do it? I get this isnt great for personal liberties (though we use to require people to show immunization records to get into school or enter the country) and we should keep an eye on the government so that things dont stick past the pandemic (like with the NSA and their anti-terrorism measures) but like most people I take this pandemic seriously and just want it to be over I dont believe in forcing people to take the shot with force (unless the virus was more deadly and Martial Law was declared) but restricting them from public places is good encouragement and helps keep immuno-compromised people and others who cant get vaccinated for medical reasons safe,Beeker93,16278566340,1

gybc19e,ndkvik,So in the facility I work in (6000+ people) we are allowing for fully vaccinated people to go without masks My company arranged for people to be vaccinated on site and before that arranged for people to get vaccinated offsite We know who the people are that did not or will not get vaccinated mainly because they wont shut up about how much of a hoax it all is This policy change came out after work on Friday Monday is going to be a shit show &#x200B; \*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\*\* TLDR: There was no shit show So Facility management sent out emails reminding people that only those that were fully vaccinated were allowed to have their masks off They also reminded people that they dont want any integrity issues by lying about being vaccinated My field requires a security clearance so a integrity issue could compromise that Walked into work today and the people who were still required to wear a mask wore one I heard minimal griping about the change in policy from the people who were unvaccinated I dont know if any minds were changed about getting the vaccine but Im appreciative that my coworkers are sticking to the mask policy,johnqpublic81,16211648840,2647
gyd6qgd,ndkvik,Its too early for masks off in public indoors We should wait until 1 There has been enough time for everyone who wants the vaccine to be FULLY vaccinated including in blue areas where appointments have been less available Many age groups have only been recently eligible in some states Also dont forget people without car access need more time 2 At least 50% of the total population is FULLY vaccinated (that means a full 6 weeks after first dose) 3 Ideally until cases are down but if idiots stop us from achieving that this summer we can at least keep masks on until the only people left 12 or older and not FULLY vaccinated are TRULY just the anti-vaxxers 4 The most ideal of all would be for most people to keep wearing masks indoors in public until fall so the 2-11 age group could be included This would also crush the case numbers even more Obviously its fine for fully vaccinated people to have private unmasked indoor parties but in public a lot of lying unmasked people just means that people still waiting for their appointments and partially vaccinated people are now forced to stay at home even more than before or may be in an unsafe environment at work Because other peoples masks protect you more than your own mask And there are definitely going to be some people who stop wearing a mask just because no one else is wearing masks or because someone is harassing them for still wearing a mask,kittey257,16211982160,2

guotxn9,mrcrm8,There was a good article somewhere about how to assess these risks at a more personal level Like the chances of bad outcomes from these things varies with stuff like age and certain pre-existing conditions along with the general community transmission rates of covid So for this headline here you would need to compare also "what are my chances of getting covid *at all*?" against the choice of vaccine If the chances of getting covid are very very low (maybe you live on an island off NZ or something) then it might make sense to avoid AstraZeneca since in your circumstances your chances of having *any* negative outcome from covid are very very very low compared with a very very low chance of negative outcome from AstraZeneca At the public health level different countries have already taken different reactions based on their particular circumstances For instance if you have a fairly dense population and are high income country and have access to something like the BioNTech vaccine then you might take the approach of abandoning AstraZeneca entirely If you are at the other extreme low income poorly developed health infrastructure lots of people long travel times from population centres you probably will press ahead with AstraZeneca and similar vaccines because of its advantages and accept that you will have some small number of complications or deaths because it is far smaller number of deaths from the much slower more expensive difficult roll out of different vaccines,FartHeadTony,16185472640,1

Im really sick of it Especially the disappointment that my family and I got our two doses of Pfizer shot and because of everything else we cant feel 100% safe from Covid Weve done our part and gotten vaccinatedcan barely wait to get a third doseand still read that vaccinated people die from this stupid virus! Regardless of your personal feelings its a public health crisisthere are way too many news articles about dying unvaccinated people saying they wish theyd gotten vaccinated Even if you think its stupid get it and be a hero for the greater good I think another worry is Bidens mental stateas in is he mentally competent?

hpjxe0s,rm4ymn,**Omicron Has 80% Lower Risk of Hospitalization New Study Shows** * Once admitted risk of severe disease is the same: NICD data * Compared to delta odds of severe omicron disease is 70% lower South Africans contracting Covid-19 in the current fourth wave of infections are 80% less likely to be hospitalized if they catch the omicron variant compared with other strains according to a study released by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases Once admitted to the hospital the risk of severe disease doesnt differ from other variants the authors led by scientists Nicole Walter and Cheryl Cohen said Compared to delta infections in South Africa between April and November omicron infections are associated with a 70% lower risk of severe disease they said The omicron data was collected for the two months through November Since being identified by South African scientists on Nov 25 the omicron variant has fueled record case numbers across the country Africas most developed economy has fully inoculated about 44% of its adult population over a seven-month period &#x200B; In the data that are being submitted to a preprint medical publication -- MedRxiv -- the authors adjusted for various confounding factors that could influence the results including age gender and whether the cases were known reinfections For severity of disease after admission they also adjusted for the presence of other illnesses and prior immunization The study also showed that those with omicron may have higher viral loads The study is "important" though its use of so-called historic controls when comparing to the delta infections between April and November means its outcome may be biased by time issues said Paul Hunter a professor of medicine at the UKs University of East Anglia "So even though cases of omicron were less likely to end up in hospital than cases of delta it is not possible to say whether this is due to inherent differences in virulence or whether this is due to higher population immunity in November compared to earlier in the year" Hunter said The authors flagged the same limitations,b3atballs,16401793260,233

gy1cr9q,nbi105,I feel like a good system to make sure people who are not vaccinated to keep wearing a mask and not lie about being vaccinated is those who have been vaccinated get a code via email text or whatever and then there will be a website or app with like [insert code here] and [insert picture here] (more on that later) and when u enter the code u get a new green screen but in the background of the green screen (it would be faded) it will have a picture of you that you just inputted into the system that way it will be a lot harder for them to get away with it Also on the bottom right it can like have your code or something or a bar code they can scan to make sure its legit By "they" I mean like whenever you walk into a public building It sounds like a lot of steps but I think this will discourage people from cheating the system When like 75-80% of US adults are fully vaccinated then we can finally say fuck it and we dont need the green screen anymore,Chungulungus,16209475990,1

gy1tg8l,nbi105,I would ideally err on the side of caution and disagree with the statement by Dr Fauci because of following (I know I might get downvoted but as someone who belongs to a family of doctors including medical researchers I would like to put in my 2 cents): 1) Masks are not only supposed to prevent you from getting infected but also prevent your mucus/ nose droplets from going out when you sneeze It has been a proven fact that it is more critical for an infected person to wear a mask than a healthy person who needs protection Moreover it has been proven that fully vaccinated people can still be asymptomatic carriers of the disease So there is a chance if vaccinated people do not wear mask in public places they might end up spreading droplets and infecting people given they are asymptomatic 2) There is a potential that this will encourage a lot of non vaccinated people to stop wearing masks in public by falsely claiming they are vaccinated I am not saying that everyone will do it but even a minor section does it it might break havoc especially as some of the new variants are highly infectious 3) Look at countries who have really done well in controlling numbers eg Singapore Apart from very effecting tracing and isolation measures mandatory masks at all public places except while doing intensive exercises (ie running in a park/ or road gyms get closed the moment cases shoot up) is one of the key factors which has limited transmission in workplaces malls beaches etc Again I do not mean to undermine his statement as he is a very learner doctor but just highlight some of the possible downsides Peace,TowardsFitness,16209563140,-2

gzw0xq0,nniy3y,Not necessarily employers but heres a fun read about this type of stuff Real Life Example: Massachusetts Mandates A Vaccine In Jacobson v Massachusetts (1905) Mr Jacobsen refused to obey a law requiring that everyone in Cambridge receive a smallpox vaccination At the time a smallpox epidemic was raging Jacobson faced a fine or imprisonment if he failed to take the vaccine Jacobsen argued that forcing him to get the vaccine violated his fundamental liberty which included freedom to control his own body The State argued that the health risk was urgent that widespread vaccination was needed to protect everyone against smallpox and that any harm to individual liberty was a price worth paying given the severe threat of smallpox The Supreme Court acknowledged that both sides had a point On one hand the Court noted that "when faced with a society-threatening epidemic a state may implement emergency measures that curtail constitutional rights so long as the measures have at least some "real or substantial relation" to the public health crisis "On the other hand the Court recognized Jacobsens argument and agreed that the vaccine order did impact liberty and personal freedom The court cautioned that "a law purporting to protect public health may nevertheless be invalid if it "has no real or substantial relation to those objects or is beyond all question a plain palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law" In short while the court balanced the two competing concernsliberty and public safetythe court came down squarely in favor of public safety holding the vaccine order was valid given the seriousness of the threat The Court said that "the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States does not import an absolute right in each person to be at all times and in all circumstances wholly freed from restraint" But the Court also warned that any if a law goes too far in restricting liberty if the law is in place for too long or reaches too far or if the goal of the law can be achieved by less invasive measures then the court may well strike down the law,LazyKidd420,16223088990,1

ha04grb,p9dd93,This is something I suggested to my company in the UK: Hi folks Ive given some consideration to this and would like to suggest the below rules to satisfy a flexible work offering to the SD: I have based this on: 23 SD staff (8x 24/7 engineers 15x Core shift) Image Image Image Each engineer must come in 40% of their time Each day there must be at least 5 people physically on rotad shift Each day there must be no more than 10 engineer on schedule We split the WFH days in any given week between a choice of Monday+Tuesday or Thursday+Friday This grants opportunity of "extended weekend feeling" to all Q: Why 40% submission to physical occupation? A: TeamLead stated Service Desk requires an obligatory 15% physical office presence on any working day Q: How does this impact skill availability? A: It doesnt this is based purely on resource as we have availability across core teams in the working week On average we will have 8 engineers physically within the office space Q: How this is managed? A: Either by a scheduling app/portal where engineers self-sign up (first come first serve) and commit to fulfilling their weekly hours or assigned by TLs Q: How does this solution address 24/7 flexibility? A: Whilst 24/7 day shift must attend the office space 24/7 night shift fulfil duties from home Any 24/7 day shift falling on a weekend is fulfilled from home This is open to your adjustments or leave as is in the pot for discussion and practical application for the business Thanks" Glad to say this has now been adopted  Before COVID happened my company was on target to turn 200m so they purchased a new HQ for 15m We are an IT Managed Service Provider The company had plans to go global looking for offices in the USA They signed the contract grace period passed and then COVID happened They were unable to back out of the deal and have since been working within regulations of UK lockdowns and government guidance to continue with the new head office plan We have lost only 1 employee during this pandemic and that was after he contracted Covid after major surgery Work load has increased the employment demand at our company due to demand from clients working remotely and other IT projects Due to Covid theyve put the expansion on the back burner for now and are cautiously monitoring markets and of course Covid itself They still want to expand to the US Fingers crossed!  As we have hospitals and government clients for technical support we were actually classed as support workers and got full 80% furlough offered but we didnt need to take it Covid has just sped up the work from home culture and those that do not change their ways are set to lose good employees Mental health has been cited as one of the major drivers with a large majority of workers being effected I personally have been wfh social distancing and wearing a mask in public since 2019 when my wife started chemotherapy after a mastectomy So this has been the norm for us long before Covid came along I do think there is a need for a physical space a lot of clients say the office is a place to separate home and work life Ive never had this as an issue in fact I am blessed that I have seen my son grow up since his birth in 2019 I get to spend time playing with him look after my wife and be home "on time" or work late if I want to An hour here and there longer doesnt kill me in fact I believe I start earlier and finish on time or happy to work later I think sales people need that physical connection and banter with their colleagues its the nature of that beast I know from a lot of clients and other companies I interviewed for that WFH was a massive positive to performance and output but over time people have got complacent or lazy and now efficiency is actually on the back slide WFH is definitely here to stay to what degree and capacity offered is another thing Ps feel free to use my wfh flexible working plan ,PrimarisBA,16296996010,1

hb1o56y,pf4633,Moderna Incs Covid vaccine generated more than double the antibodies of a similar shot made by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE in research directly comparing immune responses to the inoculations A study of almost 2500 workers at a major Belgium hospital system found antibody levels among individuals who hadnt been infected with the coronavirus before getting two doses of the Moderna vaccine averaged 2881 units per milliliter compared with 1108 units/mL in an equivalent group who got two jabs of the Pfizer shot The results published Monday in a letter to the Journal of the American Medical Association suggested the differences might be explained by the: higher amount of active ingredient in the Moderna vaccine -- 100 micrograms versus 30 micrograms in Pfizer-BioNTech longer interval between doses of the Moderna vaccine -- four weeks versus three weeks for Pfizer-BioNTech Modernas vaccine was associated with a two-fold risk reduction against breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to Pfizers in a review of people in the Mayo Clinic Health System in the US from January to July The results were reported in a separate study released ahead of publication and peer review on Aug 9,actualtext,16304105170,2894

h9pnz04,p8e6s6,"The Food and Drug Administration is pushing to approve Pfizer-BioNTechs two-dose Covid-19 vaccine on Monday further expediting an earlier timeline for licensing the shot according to people familiar with the agencys planning Regulators were working to finish the process by Friday but were still working through a substantial amount of paperwork and negotiation with the company The people familiar with the planning who were not authorized to speak publicly about it cautioned that the approval might slide beyond Monday if some components of the review need more time An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment The agency had recently set an unofficial deadline for approval of around Labor Day The approval is expected to pave the way for a series of vaccination requirements by public and private organizations who were awaiting firmer regulatory backing before implementing mandates Federal and state health officials are also hoping that an approved vaccine will draw interest from some Americans who have been hesitant to take one that was only authorized for emergency use a phenomenon suggested by recent polling Some universities and hospitals are expected to mandate inoculation once a vaccine is fully approved The Pentagon earlier this month said it plans to make Covid vaccinations mandatory for the countrys 13 million active-duty troops "no later" than the middle of next month or sooner if the FDA acts earlier The timing of the approval could result in an uncomfortable messaging problem for the Biden administration which on Wednesday announced that fully vaccinated people should prepare to get booster shots eight months after they received second doses Approving the vaccine and encouraging boosters at the same time may suggest to some that the vaccine as licensed is inadequate without an extra shot The FDA last week updated its authorizations of Pfizer-BioNTechs and Modernas vaccine to allow third doses for some immunocompromised people a decision backed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Regulators are still reviewing Modernas application for full approval for its coronavirus vaccine and a decision could come at least several weeks after the one for Pfizer-BioNTech",urbanpencil,16294944330,203

They have to know we are all in the middle of a global pandemic but they make a conscious decision and concerted effort to harm others and avoid any and all safety measures they refuse to follow guidelines and said guidelines are rarely enforced You ask them politely to be considerate and they swear and insult you its political to them and to everyone else its life and death Its really starting to become so sickening that the next time I see someone In safeway without a mask you can only assume they are also unvaxxed ill politely tell them to be considerate and wear a mask if they call me names or cough in my direction like others have i might just have to beat them over the head with an object I find nearby perhaps a #10 can Ive done everything I possibly can do to avoid catching or spreading this disease Im vaxxed boosted I mask up everytime I am out in public and meanwhile the people who refuse to do so are the ones responsible for covid longevity and the mutations If 100% of the population were to have masked from the beginning & if 100% of the population were vaccinated wed be a lot better off We might have been able to improve the situation for everyone but because a certain percentage of the population refuse to do anything were all worse off AntivXxers are literally the reason this virus is being allowed to mutate and spread so rapidly The only thing these people are doing by refusing to mask up is allowing the disease to spread further Life as we know it is over and I blame anti maskers and anti vaxxers and I am beyond mad Ive lost hope and I honestly dont care at this point but I want these people to know that its not going to be tolerated they cant be allowed to continue to be selfish and knowingly spread a deadly disease If we ever want things to go back to normal or even semi normal the people who refuse to do the right thing or even the bare minimum they might get the message if any time they are seen maskless in public for starters theyll be asked politely to mask up if they refuse or get confrontational they should be severely beaten this needs to be the norm Everytime they go out in public and refuse to wear a mask and refuse at the behest of others to do so they deserve serious physical injuries They do not deserve to be out in public with all the other people who have actually made an effort to reduce the spread of covid19 People who sacrificed so much and who have literally put their lives on hold to prevent this disease their sacrifices are diminished while the antimaskers behave as if nothing is wrong Their ignorance should not be allowed to continue to harm others Antivaxxers and anti maskers who arent already dead from the disease deserve to be harshly ridiculed and possibly assaulted into cooperation or worse if need be I know this may sound absurd to some of you but what other measures can be enacted?

hqf6iaj,rr7div,More than likely there are people at your job who are asymptomatic and have the virus unless of course each job has the ability to test employees daily (they dont) At some point people just have to accept that every public setting you go to has the potential for community spread regardless of the safety measures people take Theres going to be at least one person in every place you go who has COVID All of this is boiling down to your own personal risk tolerance at this point Were past the point where avoiding infection should be the primary goal All of that was fucked up last year when we could have significantly limited infection,NineteenAD9,16407931510,5
hqg0acr,rr7div,It seems SO likely that everyone will get Omicron the way its being talked about in the media I consume Previous infection wont prevent it Vaccinations wont prevent it Boosters wont prevent it (Ive had all those) Cloth masks wont prevent it Disposable surgical masks wont prevent it Unless you and everyone you live with can stay home and isolated from the public for several weeks which VERY few people can do Im led to believe well just all get it It almost seems futile to even try to avoid it Why avoid a fun NYE party to prevent infection when Im going to get it anyway from the grocery from work or from my kids bringing it home from school?

The messaging throughout this pandemic has been shit even when Ive been "on board" with it At some point these leaders are going to have to pull their heads out of their asses and let us get on with our lives Mandate masks in public and encourage social distancing sure but beyond that dont let businesses reopen if youre just going to beg workers to spend all our remaining time at home So dumb,LettuceBeGrateful,16408352530,1

hmrq413,r5ueps,I dont see an English option (on mobile page) so I ran the article through Google translate: Preliminary data: The vaccine protects highly effectively against the new variant Marciano Foundation The information received in Israel about the Omicron - the good and bad news: After Bennetts declaration of "state of emergency" in Israel tonight received preliminary data - both from South Africa and Europe - on the new variant that is causing concern around the world The data revealed tonight (Tuesday) in the "main edition" shortly after being received in Israel are preliminary - but indicate that the vaccine is still effective against the newly discovered mutations The data were collected in both South Africa and European countries where verifications were found in the new variant It should be emphasized that these are preliminary data that the whole world is waiting for and at this point they become the working assumption According to these data the effectiveness of the vaccine (for those who received three doses ie also the booster) decreases only slightly: 90% protection compared to 95% protection against the Delta strain These are impressive and somewhat reassuring figures The effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing serious illness for those who have been vaccinated three times is the same as the effectiveness against the Delta strain - the strain that has been the most dominant in Israel so far The alarming data But not everything is rosy: the problems start with the risk of recovering from being infected The data show that the risk of recovering from infection is twice as high as in Delta and the rate of infection is 13 times higher than in Delta This rate of infection is very high: in South Africa there is talk that in 15 days the number of patients has increased 15 times Although the numbers are low the rate is problematic and worrying: in Israel there are many Israelis who are not vaccinated Another worrying statistic has been revealed regarding the unvaccinated: their risk of becoming seriously ill is 24 times that of the original strain of the corona the one that arrived in Israel nearly two years ago In "unvaccinated" the reference is also to those vaccinated in two doses who are entitled to a booster and have not yet been vaccinated and therefore their protection is insufficient Despite this news the data is a reassuring siren when it comes to protecting vaccinated people from both serious illness and infection for further reading: South Africa to Israel: "Vaccine effective against Omicron variant" The Omicron variant captured the continent of Europe unprepared A new variant has been identified in Africa Will Ben Gurion Airport close because of the new variant? The Corona Cabinet approved: Insulation for returnees from abroad African variant Omicron (Photo: Reuters) South Africa has transferred new information to Israel - and this is the data | Photo: Reuters The contradictory messages of vaccine manufacturers The test of the effectiveness of existing vaccines against the new variant was in its infancy but Modern CEO Stefan Bensel managed to arouse global concern today when he said in an interview with the Financial Times that he expects a significant decrease in vaccine efficacy But Bensel spoke of a decline in benefit from a disease with symptoms rather than a serious illness - a difference that is known to be dramatic in corona contexts as Pfizer CEO Albert Burla was apt to describe: Defense compared to Delta but that would be the limit In both cases the booster vaccines are expected to reduce the gap dramatically " Burla who promised to know more about the benefits of the vaccine against the variant in about a week and a half said Pfizer had already begun developing a specific vaccine against the variant a few days ago "We know the genetic linkage of the virus we have it - thats how it starts" he explained "We started at risk to produce a vaccine We actually started on Friday to produce a vaccine based on the flooring the DNA template that would allow us to make RNA that would eventually women within that vaccine" Israel meanwhile is waiting for a more categorical statement from the two CEOs and meanwhile relies on data coming from South Africa - where the variant was first discovered - and from which it appears that the omicron is more contagious but is no more violent "Data on the benefits of the vaccine - there may be some partial data from South Africa" Dr Sharon Elrai-Price head of public health services said today during a debate in the Knesset I know they are doing the lab tests as I described to see how useful the vaccine against this variant is " Bennett worried: "There is a lot of uncertainty" Albert Burla and Naftali Bennett (Adapted by Reuters) Burla optimistic Bennett explains why he activated the GSS | Arrangement: Reuters At the same time the government is today approving a memorandum of law that will allow it to extend the decision to allow the GSS to verify the cellular devices of those infected with Omicron or the suspects who were infected with it with high probability - in order to interrupt the transmission chains as quickly as possible But just before the move reaches the Knesset the coalition itself is sharply critical of the law Prime Minister Bennett - who saw for himself how in the ministers WhatsApp groups Ministers Saar Shasha-Bitton Barbibai and Avidar voted against - told today why Israel decided to include the GSS in the campaign despite and perhaps because it is a low number of infected "There is a lot of uncertainty and that is why we are taking these extreme measures" he said in a video call with Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schlenberg "But our advantage as leaders is that once we know more when there is more information - we can let go of those measures gradually" As for the restrictions at Ben Gurion Airport the prime minister has already decided that these will last about two weeks from the date of the decision - and only if the final proof does come that the variant does not endanger the populations immunity or the omicron is already spread in the community - these restrictions will be removed Yaron Avraham participated in the preparation of the article,Serenity101,16383425550,2

hnflckn,r9otza,Ive been teaching in China for 18 years and this is par for the course Ill first say Ive always worked in the private sector and there have been times that Ive been outsourced to public schools on occasion while working with a few schools in the past What a gong show Not criticizing China Just humanity in general So I came **right** after the WHO lifted the SARS travel ban to China Id planned on moving to China earlier and SARS ended up delaying my departure by a few months There are always sick kids coming to school It really broke my heart Id see kids as young as 4 years old coming to class run down and sick It just made me think "if youre going to run your kid into the ground like this at this age what kind of physical condition can you expect them to be in when theyre 30?" When H1N1 was a thing I was working 3 afternoons a week at a high school and DAMN I had classes where students were constantly going to the bathroom to puke their guts out 1/4-1/3 of the students were clearly effected I constantly encouraged them to go home but they didnt see it as an option because their teachers and parents didnt accept the practice of saying home to get better and not risk spreading their illness to others A few years later I had a kid come to school looking kinda sick and before class I asked the girls mother and she upright admitted that she was aware that her child was infected with FMD which can be extremely fatal to humans who are younger/have less developed immune systems I couldnt believe this woman I informed my co-workers of the situation We immediately locked all of the classrooms because we didnt want anyone in the other classrooms to get infected It literally took over an hour to convince the mother to take her child out of the school It was literally impossible to convince her that shed done something wrong by taking her child outside let alone to a school filled with other younglings She attempted to fight the manager when we told her that she wouldnt be able to bring her child back into the school without proof from a local hospital that her daughter was no longer contagious After the insane woman left we spent a few hours sanitizing everything in the school It must have been a weird experience for the kids and teachers in the other classrooms They normally would have finished class a long time ago and would have been let out of the classroom for breaks but they had to just hang out in the classroom while we insured that wed done our best to make sure it was safe for the kids to come out TBH we shouldnt have had anything to do with this process There should have been some division of the government to contact to have them ensure that this is done properly especially given how this disease is famous for coming through areas and taking the lives of children in waves but yeah we didnt have such a luxury at our disposal COVID wasnt nearly as bad The government had clearly learned from SARS and figured out a way to deal with it in their own way After the COVID lockdown had ended it was really nice to see so many kids come to class wearing masks I even had co-workers wearing masks when they had a cold which is something I couldnt have imagined happening ever before COVID COVID really made me question why the hell we havent been wearing masks when under the weather all of these years I think it should be a given You shouldnt be free to spread your germs when youre feeling ill just regardless of whether or not you live in a free country,ThaddCorbett,16387743750,13

hfkfxux,q2ckda,The creation of a second class citizen group based on medical choice is a fascinating philosophical question that I dont think people are taking very seriously at the moment At the moment for most people this situation seems very cut and dry: "Get vaccine which helps you & others or else suffer the consequences" There are many good public health reasons to encourage vaccination - both via carrots and sticks However moving this premise out 20- 30- 50 years from now as technology advances would we feel comfortable with the same principles applying to other medical interventions? If we discovered a way (gattaca-style) to make some genetic tweaks that ensured a person would be at a much reduced chance for disease transfer in the future -- would that be okay to mandate (or deny services to that person if they didnt receive the genetic tweak)? Maybe so Maybe as society/ technology changes its entirely fine to mandate such things Its just an interesting philosophical question that I think we arent giving full consideration to yet,paro54,16334942450,126

Police EMS Healthcare workers teachers and other school employees all public workers should be banding together to support protecting their communities Right now the biggest threat to virtually all communities is the spread of COVID The message that should be uniting everyone is our civic duty to protect our community by getting everyone vaccinated who can be vaccinated,PukingDiogenes,16305232630,12

gujn6zw,mqz31i,I saw a post in r/Connecticut that someone was charged an administration fee at UCONN Health I copied this off their site >Vaccine doses purchased with US taxpayer dollars will be given to the American people at no cost However vaccination providers such as UConn Health are able to charge an administration fee for giving the shot to someone **Vaccine providers can get this fee reimbursed by the patients public or private insurance company or for uninsured patients by the Health Resources and Services Administrations Provider Relief Fund** Just wanted to make sure people know that if they are uninsured and the place they get the vaccine asks for the fee tell them they have to bill the Feds Dont pay out of pocket,raynethackery,16184423410,72
gul012i,mqz31i,I have undocumented friends and what I heard is that is fine to show up to the vaccine appointment with zero documents like a passport or something; meaning if you think someomes afraid to get vaccines because they fear deportation encourage them to attend their appointment with no documents that could put them at risk if the person at the front or whatever doesnt know that they have to vaccinate you anyway escalate a little (as is safe) and a store manager will help you proceed (most people checking appointments are not always familiar with the nuanced immigration statuses) anyway popular post and buried bla bla but if youre reading this help us spread; whether or not you agree with undocumented immigrants getting rights or whatever is way better for our public safety that they get vaccinated so please help us get the word around!,dvidsilva,16184734270,4

hemx0f8,pxc6hb,I hate how much weight celebrities carry when it comes to things like vaccination but I am glad LeBron is doing the right thing and being public about it,AvocadosAreMeh,16328593790,3039
hemif18,pxc6hb,So many people have been blaming Lebron for the anti-vaxx sentiment in the NBA Turns out hes already vaccinated Take that haters The Lakers are fully vaccinated EDIT: Also his endorsement on getting vaccinated carries sway in both the NBA and to the public,PepeBabinski,16328532770,43
heo4nit,pxc6hb,Using terms like did my research isnt helping anyone LeBron Thats just giving air and credence to the morons who think doing research is reading memes on Facebook LeBron didnt research shit Hes not a doctor or researcher Hes a basketball player and a businessman The truth of the matter here is that smarter people than LeBron did *their* research and he took medical advice which in and of itself is praiseworthy However kowtowing to the moronic segment of the community with "I did my research" is disingenuous at best and form LeBron downright dangerous at worst Jordan was selling sneakers when he said "Republicans buy sneakers too"; LeBron is playing a much much more consequential game,TakeshiKovacsSleeve3,16328792460,1
henk3we,pxc6hb,Guarantee lebron was one of the first thousand vaccinated and is just using this as publicity because of nicki minaj,susbarusti3,16328695860,1
henrvts,pxc6hb,Proof these people are dumb as shit and needed two years of people dying left and right for him to get it and make it some thing public i hope the people who love following his status that dont have the vaccine follow suit You would think professional athletes would have had the wherewithal to get it in the first place,FROCKHARD,16328732240,1
henx1y5,pxc6hb,Its perfectly reasonable to be skeptical Especially about a vaccine that was released so quickly But I think it was released around March-April for the general public It doesnt take 5-6 months to do your own research on this vaccine There are countless videos of Dr Fauci explaining how it was made what is in it how it works in the body the chances of having a negative reaction the testing process and how it was able to be released so quickly All that information is available to read on the CDC John Hopkins different hospital websites etcIts everywhere I guess my point is that it shouldnt have taken him this long to get the vaccine and the excuse of "doing your own research" just doesnt cut it IMO,BootySweat0217,16328756650,1
hep1r3g,pxc6hb,Hot take: "I did my research" is not a great public advocacy message To a lot of people that means read vile conspiracy theories on Facebook for 8 hours The message should be "if you have concerns talk to your doctor",gnocchicotti,16328987280,1

hjt6fwc,qpcnyc,Canadian here Forget about having them pay; Id like to just send the unvaccinated home Weve read so much about surgeries being canceled or delayed because ICU beds are taken up with COVID patients Just give them two Tylenols tell them to drink lots of water and have them call the coroner in the morning And then formalize it into a law that anyone who has declined a Health Canada recommended vaccine is not eligible for hospital treatment for that disease And I know there are plenty of other decisions and lifestyles people make that put a strain on the public health care system Overeating smoking drinking etc But none of these are as quick and easy to fix as just getting a free shot Nor are we fighting aggressive foreign-funded misinformation campaigns about them I feel like a hard stance needs to be taken that keeping up to date on vaccines is just a basic almost-zero-effort requirement for participating in a modern society particularly one with a public health care system,Hieremias,16363838220,10
hy7g5tb,szo1gx,I dont know what to tell internet people except that for a lot of us COVID changed nearly nothing The jobs didnt let us go home the bills kept coming no checks came in the mail except for those two that everyone mocked for being silly and not even covering one month of rent Unless we wanted to quit and stay home (no unemployment checks for quitters in the US) there was no real choice except to carry on mask up and go to work Its been same crap different day since March 2020 Sometimes you hear about somebodys granny passing away or your coworker goes home with COVID for two weeks while you pick up the slack and then they come back and thats the end of it Theres been a huge mismatch between the online wailing about COVID and the actual experience of living with it and when I say living with it I mean week in and week out in one of the industries where we had higher COVID death rates than the medical people did Line cooks dont take masking very seriously Too high probably think 5G is the virus MOST of the US has been in this boat the entire time The poor Amazon workers didnt get a single day off they got overtime Only on the internet do people seem to live in this weird parallel universe defined by work from home and perpetual COVID measures Its been a hell of a thing to watch people act like thats normal It doesnt matter what I think of any of it I didnt even get to stay home from work for a week while I watched the whole world slam the shutters at once thats how much power I have Call me all the names you want Tell me Im stupid or whatever I have no control over your situation Outside of your bubble its been "normal" this entire time Its been two solid years of everyone carrying on more or less as usual The virus has somehow avoided presenting a face to the public that would make them treat it like a mortal threat the way things like Ebola did and the bosses arent letting anyone off the hook since they can all stay home safe if they wanna Youre the educated middle class not me Youre the ones who should have come up with some sort of way to force whatever it is youre wanting on the world Perpetual work from home? I dont know what you want You had the money resources safety and time to do something about it politically All I know is that everyone has been living in "normal" for a quarter of a decade except for you deaths or no deaths It seems that all your kind can really muster is thinkpieces like this one that tell everyone what they already know and that will fail to convince anyone who doesnt want to know Its just ineffective handwringing except for maybe this writer made a buck from it Maybe Mourn if you want to but theyre obviously going to drag you all back into the offices by your scruffs that or fire you Again its been "normal" since like June 2020 and it looks like its finally your turn at that shit sandwich Whatever the hell this is thats normal now,AttackPug,16456826160,6

hy8btrk,szo1gx,COVID is costly in terms of its impact on health and the amount of people it kills but another cost that still rarely finds its way into the public discourse is the psychological cost of lockdowns People are social creatures and social activities are necessary for the proper psychological development of children for the maintenance of mental health for elderly and most importantly to avoid loneliness Dr John Cacioppo who passed in 2018 but was the worlds greatest mind on the topic of loneliness research estimated the cost of loneliness as being equivalent to smoking a pack of cigarettes per day And to clarify he wasnt talking about mere psychological discomfort he was talking about the impact of loneliness on our physiological health and the way loneliness actually causes people to die But when peoples lives are abbreviated by loneliness we dont record loneliness as the cause of death so it never shows up in population health statistics If you talk about COVID and lockdowns but avoid ignore things like compromised mental health addiction depression and loneliness then you are missing the bigger picture,LoudestGuyAtTheParty,16457042200,1
hy9n5yo,szo1gx,That article is based on the argument that our numbers are so high that its not rational to go back to normal so quickly What it ignored is the trend of the numbers - the numbers go up and down and it is now going down Its sad that there were 1M deaths But no amount of public health policy will bring them back Its time to learn from the past and move forward,dchobo,16457245730,1
