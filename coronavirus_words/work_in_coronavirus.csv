h7bgqj0,ovpxdj,Uh yeah School starts in 2 weeks and I have no choice but to send my asthmatic kid with scarred lungs from dozens of bouts of bronchitis and pneumonia back into the classroom Because Texas isnt allowing virtual learning and our governor signed an executive order to stop schools from requiring masks So I have no choice but to put him back in a classroom of 25 kids breathing all over each other ( and never washing their hands lets be real) hope his vaccine and his mask are enough because nobody else here is going to have their kids wear them voluntarily So you could use "angry" as an appropriate descriptor You could also say terrified Edit: For all those saying either homeschool or move: I am in the process of rearranging my life (work my own education which can and will obviously be put on hold because it comes way behind my kids wellbeing household expenses etc) to accommodate homeschooling but its not an overnight process Im trying He is too young to stay at home while I go to work every day But I have to work to live and I have to have health insurance to cover my sons meds theyre very expensive As for moving do you have any idea how much that costs? I have picked up and moved out of state before thats how I got here Im not native to Texas It costs thousands of dollars Have you seen the rental/real estate market lately? Its insane If I and my spouse leave our jobs to relocate it would be nearly impossible to find the same income and our rent would increase by as much as double People dont always have the privilege of just picking up and moving somewhere else That costs money and lots of it even to just move to another city and not everyone has that kind of money at their disposal,AncestralFoil247,16278291300,2817

People refused to do basic things like social distance and wear masks so now when we are at a point where getting a vaccine is becoming the only option left to really fight this thing; people are saying no because clearly the masks and social distancing didnt work so why would the vaccine?

h7cho06,ovpxdj,According to the research being done especially in places like Israel that has a population over 60 at 80% vaccinated by February data is showing the vaccine effectiveness is fading quick and dramatically Had you been vaccinated in January such as myself youll find youre at best walking around with an effectiveness of nearly 20% compared to someone vaccinated in June who is around 80% If unvaccinated people are the only ones getting sick the concern we are seeing wouldnt be there You would be protected with your vaccination and would have little to worry about The truth is we will see more variants and until we have boosters available and ones that can be made quickly before the new variants take hold we will continue to see spikes regardless of previous vaccinations Instead we are seeing vaccinated people spreading the virus and some knowingly I know first hand someone who is currently infected after being vaccinated in april and she continues to work at her job since the symptoms arent bad according to her and she is vaccinated The anti vaxxers are a problem but theyre a distraction from the real issue that your vaccine will only provide so much protection and its not a ticket to do whatever you want If the vaccine worked effectively for the current delta variant they would only be their own problem Kind of like driving a car with a seatbelt The direct impact is only to the individual I have and still continue to wear two masks including an n95 as well as limit my public interactions It isnt hard to wear a mask its not hard to use common sense even if youre vaccinated Weve had a hospital in my metropolitan area that had 20% of the admitted covid patients fully vaccinated It all depends on when your state started doing vaccines and how long ago it had been since you got yours And we will see a lot more of these so called "breakthrough" cases regardless of vaccination rates And government officials have been warned already of this and the CDC has discussed this internally and a lot of people are concerned about the effectiveness of the vaccines The mask mandate should have never been removed and local governments have also failed their constituents,mrnight8,16278464230,1

This is anecdotal but its increasing in frequency I am not vaxxed yet but I take all necessary precautions Anyone at my work who IS vaccinated gets to walk around without masks Well a girl at work who IS vaccinated tested positive after showing symptoms and forced anyone at work who is taking all necessary precaution to stay home and have to get tested and wait for results but the vaccinated people continued to go to work and walk around without masks Whichever side you are on about this you cannot tell me this isnt absolutely ludicrous decision making Vaccinated people can still get it and get sick and spread it You are not invincible if you are vaccinated,thisismyname03,16278602360,1

ha1m2gi,pa00vu,Bad name but oh well :) Going to be interesting to see if more employers now will grow a pair and start requiring vaccinations Related - its absolute utter horseshit that there are religious exemptions to the vaccinations I fully expect to see a major uptick in the number of new spiritual workers if employers offer that loophole If your religion really says you cant be vaccinated you should also be exempt from getting treated in hospitals--go find a spiritual advisor to pray away the covid,ZenZulu,16297336280,3

ha2l9i4,pa00vu,So now that the FDA approved the vaccine does that mean that people will be forced to get one in order to go into public places?

ha25hfj,pa00vu,Im still a little confused on how approvals work between different vaccines If Pfizer is the only one fully approved and this means that companies governments etc can mandate it with little to no legal recourse what does that mean for people who got Moderna/J&J? Will these companies/governments be mandating Pfizer vaccines only? I guess this isnt really that big of an issue if Moderna is probably getting full approval soon but still curious,str1kebeam,16297415590,1

ha5r6k9,pa00vu,Ok so I have a question because I cant seem to find the answer myself from searching so the next logical thing is to ask people smarter than me on Reddit I am vaccinated and I feel everyone should be however vaccine passports and restrictions and the like dont make sense to me For the fact now with Delta a vaccinated person can catch and spread the virus just as easy as an unvaccinated person how does this ever stop the pandemic? The vaccine was always said as keeping you alive or out of the hospital not preventing transmission so why restrict what unvaccinated people can do if the risk is the same to each other? I can definitely understand the push to get vaccinated to not overwhelm hospital workers whove been busting ass for so long but they tout it as get vaccinated to end the pandemic unvaccinated people are continuing to extend the pandemic but vaccinated people now do the same thing I think their message is unclear and I think so many mandates that are based of case count is wrong since the vaccine isnt intended to stop transmission it should be off hospitalizations and deaths Thanks to anyone who helps clear this up for me,Quitefrankly27,16298119330,1

gxyeklz,nb0qrm,This is completely laughable Im sure that the people who havent gotten the vaccine yet have other reasons than it not being incentivised Examples include: not being able to get off at work; having another serious illness at the moment and not wanting to risk a lowered immunity; limited supply and could not obtain one to date; or of course those who dont want vaccines in general Suddenly awarding money for those who have received it at the expense of having $5 million to do something else with that could benifot hundreds of people,Critical-Coat-1593,16208933390,1

gybc19e,ndkvik,So in the facility I work in (6000+ people) we are allowing for fully vaccinated people to go without masks My company arranged for people to be vaccinated on site and before that arranged for people to get vaccinated offsite We know who the people are that did not or will not get vaccinated mainly because they wont shut up about how much of a hoax it all is This policy change came out after work on Friday Monday is going to be a shit show &#x200B; \*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\*\* TLDR: There was no shit show So Facility management sent out emails reminding people that only those that were fully vaccinated were allowed to have their masks off They also reminded people that they dont want any integrity issues by lying about being vaccinated My field requires a security clearance so a integrity issue could compromise that Walked into work today and the people who were still required to wear a mask wore one I heard minimal griping about the change in policy from the people who were unvaccinated I dont know if any minds were changed about getting the vaccine but Im appreciative that my coworkers are sticking to the mask policy,johnqpublic81,16211648840,2647
gybqebq,ndkvik,Of course theyll lie the CDC knows that Everyone knows that Not all of us were born yesterday It sucks for those that are incapable of vaccinating but I dont know how else the CDC is supposed to proceed under the assumption that the vaccines are as effective as they are They cant force people to get shots the anti-maskers will continue to refuse shots those that cant get shots but otherwise want them cant get vaccinated and most people that want the shot are getting it They also cant expect masks to work forever just because more people get sick of them by the day Eventually people will just accept the risk like many had already been doing Really there is no way forward for the CDC with the pre-existing guidance which is why the guidance changed The belief that everyone should get vaccinated comes from the desire to eradicate COVID; that ship has sailed as early as last June and we still expect the cows to come back to the barn The cows are gone: COVID is here to stay The CDC finally threw its hands up and said "ok you want to deal with Covid? Fuck it have all the Covid you want If you want to live you know where the vaccine is" Frankly I cant blame them and would probably do the same myself I feel bad for those that cant get the Covid shot for allergies or whatever else but I dont feel bad at all if someone gets sick because they refuse to get the vaccine Now its like any other anti-vaxxor talking point,AyyyGreens,16211740740,119

gyd6qgd,ndkvik,Its too early for masks off in public indoors We should wait until 1 There has been enough time for everyone who wants the vaccine to be FULLY vaccinated including in blue areas where appointments have been less available Many age groups have only been recently eligible in some states Also dont forget people without car access need more time 2 At least 50% of the total population is FULLY vaccinated (that means a full 6 weeks after first dose) 3 Ideally until cases are down but if idiots stop us from achieving that this summer we can at least keep masks on until the only people left 12 or older and not FULLY vaccinated are TRULY just the anti-vaxxers 4 The most ideal of all would be for most people to keep wearing masks indoors in public until fall so the 2-11 age group could be included This would also crush the case numbers even more Obviously its fine for fully vaccinated people to have private unmasked indoor parties but in public a lot of lying unmasked people just means that people still waiting for their appointments and partially vaccinated people are now forced to stay at home even more than before or may be in an unsafe environment at work Because other peoples masks protect you more than your own mask And there are definitely going to be some people who stop wearing a mask just because no one else is wearing masks or because someone is harassing them for still wearing a mask,kittey257,16211982160,2

Dont worry about it; you can have as much Covid as you want You already know where the vaccine is if you want to live" I cant say I blame them; Id probably do the same I feel bad for those that cant get the Covid shot for allergies or whatever else but I dont feel bad at all if someone gets sick because they refuse to get the vaccine Its now just like every other anti-vaccination talking point,Hot_Firefighter,16211888960,1

Does the anticipated decrease in hospitalizations outweigh the potential decrease in the labor force? Consider also the compounding effects of a labor shortage ( yes I know its actually a wage shortage) on the already fractured supply chain Additionally how much benefit will we actually see from this mandate if (when) a vaccine resistant variant of covid begins to dominate?

Who are the guests? Are they experts what credentials do they have who do they work for are they bro-ing it up by bullshitting/bantering on a podcast or are they seriously describing their field of study? Are they trying to make themselves look good? Etc etc If Joe Rogan (or anyone else expert or otherwise) looks you in the eyes and seriously tells you something like "Cigarettes arent bad for you its all government propaganda" I would hope you have enough going on in your head to think to yourself "hey that probably isnt right" Maybe dont live your life by that advice just yet This is true of people who both love and hate this podcast There were plenty of instances where something was said that people heavily criticized that were clearly off the cuff remarks or jokes Theres also things that were said with authority and under the guise of expertise that were flat out incorrect or misinformed Taking a celebrity as the end all of where you get advice from is a terrible idea Even statements coming from experts are usually worth internalizing and thinking about but also checking up on and doing a bit of research for what the general consensus is and how it applies to your unique circumstance,cheapseats91,16196457420,58

gy1tg8l,nbi105,I would ideally err on the side of caution and disagree with the statement by Dr Fauci because of following (I know I might get downvoted but as someone who belongs to a family of doctors including medical researchers I would like to put in my 2 cents): 1) Masks are not only supposed to prevent you from getting infected but also prevent your mucus/ nose droplets from going out when you sneeze It has been a proven fact that it is more critical for an infected person to wear a mask than a healthy person who needs protection Moreover it has been proven that fully vaccinated people can still be asymptomatic carriers of the disease So there is a chance if vaccinated people do not wear mask in public places they might end up spreading droplets and infecting people given they are asymptomatic 2) There is a potential that this will encourage a lot of non vaccinated people to stop wearing masks in public by falsely claiming they are vaccinated I am not saying that everyone will do it but even a minor section does it it might break havoc especially as some of the new variants are highly infectious 3) Look at countries who have really done well in controlling numbers eg Singapore Apart from very effecting tracing and isolation measures mandatory masks at all public places except while doing intensive exercises (ie running in a park/ or road gyms get closed the moment cases shoot up) is one of the key factors which has limited transmission in workplaces malls beaches etc Again I do not mean to undermine his statement as he is a very learner doctor but just highlight some of the possible downsides Peace,TowardsFitness,16209563140,-2

gzvqvfo,nniy3y,Ima set aside the stupidity of this and simply remind everyone that any mandate your employer wants to implement must be applied to uniformly to everyone for it to be legal &#x200B; For example if your company threatens to fire you for being unvaccinated; they must also fire every unvaccinated full time employee that has been working there for years (**employees whom the company has already invested allot of time and money in training**) If they cherry pick just you then that is discrimination &#x200B; In typical media fashion allot of articles try to place shift the blame onto the individual as if claiming "If YOU dont get the vaccine YOU will face the consequences of not being allowed to work"; when in really the language of these laws is tailored to the employers choice not the employee and should instead be reported as "If WE want to hinder our hiring pool to only vaccinated people we will" **You (the individual employee) are not choosing to be unemployed for not being vaccinated your boss is choosing to fire you** So no need to worry about whether they can or cant mandate this They wont do it because it will for certain cause a labor shortage to them and potentially a discrimination lawsuit if they use it as a reason to fire only the employees they dont like &#x200B; ps: if youre going to post the dumbass response of "many employers already mandate it hurr hurr hurr"; please enlighten us and list specifically which ones Yea Yea Yea you read some article saying that companies are going to do it Name then tell us specifically which companies are right now mandating the vaccine and have fired or are otherwise threatening to fire unvaccinated employees,AbortedBaconFetus,16223037430,3

gzvm272,nniy3y,I work for a hospital system and we have been discussing this from the very beginning This guidance from the EEOC makes mandates possible for employers to require the vaccine It removes the legal challenge hurdles that employees could bring if an employer mandates a vaccine with an emergency approval from the FDA (which isnt full drug authorization and not fully tested) However because of the number of vaccinations in the US Pfizer is in process of requesting full FDA authorization By the EEOC making this action it ramps up the timeline making it possible for employers to take action now instead of 3-4 months later this summer/fall when we may see increases I infection rates TLDR - this moves up the timeline for employers to make vaccinations mandatory improving vaccination rates and protecting more people especially those who cannot get the vaccine (immuno-compromised and those under 12),tumbleweedcowboy,16223012420,1

Have the thousands of service employees that depend on those jobs to pay their rent and feed their kids figured it out or are they still depending on aid and hoping things go back to normal? Im not denying that WFH is desirable and going to happen for a lot of people But in a country (Im the US just to be clear) that has an increasing economic divide I cant help but believe that it exacerbates as it becomes more and more likely that urban office neighborhoods are going to be seriously depopulated if they come back at all,georgethethirteenth,16296641290,19

We used to limit meeting times to 9:30am to 3:30pm to respect everyones start and end times but now thats all out the window * People know you cant travel anywhere and are probably nearby if you have vacation time This has led to what I consider a toxic expectation that youre always around unless you explicitly tell people youre truly unavailable between these certain hours on your damn vacation Two of the managers who took vacations this summer still came online for meetings I guess maybe its admirable in the eyes of some but IMO is there nothing better to do? Read a book or go cook a meal for your kids Thats what Id be doing * I talk with my hands a lot Being confined to a tiny Zoom meeting box that filters out my arms feels stifling to me * Im not as fast on the unmute button as some people and it feels like I can never get a word in because of it Not everyone has cameras on or is paying attention to the cameras so they dont really pick up on social cues that someone is about to speak Using the "raise hand" function is nice in theory but few respect it One of my best skills in meetings was not only doing that but also respecting the quieter people and creating venues for them to speak Now its just an unmute race and Im always losing * I struggle to stay focused in Zoom meetings Its not that Im playing games or checking e-mails Even if I turn on my camera full-screen my monitor for the meeting to block out all distractions and try my best to stay focused I completely zone out hearing voices of people in various volumes and quality blasted directly into my ear via headphones * I cant stand to be in my home office after work I used to love gaming here but now I just want nothing to do with it The whole room is associated with work and I dont want to step foot in it after I log off As a programmer I used to like coming in here putting on some movies and experimenting with new tech but now it seems like a chore Its like my company now owns part of my house I still consider myself lucky that I dont have to work out of my bedroom though Is this just my company or are other people experiencing this too? I dont even know if all of these are related to working from home or not but they definitely werent problems at my company before we moved to a fully WFH environment Its strange too because we were a hybrid setup before with a mix of full remote people and people across multiple offices who wouldnt come in every day and things *seemed* fine,bluetista1988,16296690980,14

h9x38c3,p9dd93,Ive been managing a remote engineering team for about 15 years- long long before Covid After managing onsite teams for about 15 before that It is IMHO night and day more difficult to manage the remote team And IMHO most of the issues solved by remote work are actually issues with horrible open offices and long commutes- not anything specifically to do with remote vs onsite work Some thoughts from doing this for over a decade: * 25% of people will be productive no matter where they are 25% will be problematic no matter where they are 50% of people work better with some form of office infrastructure Everyone thinks they are in that first 25% * Dealing with HR issues is much much more problematic with remote employees Try dealing with terming someone with a substance abuse problem when you never get to see them in person and dont have an attendance record to support your HR case * Peoples home environments are often horribly full of distractions People put up with this during Covid because there were no other alternatives- but having someones toddler running around screaming during meetings is an issue A good WFH environment will have a dedicated home office and a good WFH employee will have uninterrupted time in that office- but most dont have their home workspaces set up properly * Peoples WFH performance deteriorates over time- especially over many years Especially with employees with kids who only one parent is WFH Suddenly you realize that you are working around an employee who has to pick up the kids from school every day during work hours- folks start building lives/schedules around being able to disappear for a couple hours a day * There are simply no good current tech substitutes for a classic conference room whiteboard session Doing this remotely sucks All of that can be managed with appropriate focus/tools/etc But it adds substantially to the managerial effort required I think it seemed to work during Covid better than it would have because many tech firms paused or slowed down their project work during that period (I know all of my clients basically shelved most of the project deliverables last/this year and we are just now getting back to regular project planning cycles) Well see maybe Ill be wrong and the tech has progressed to the point where this will work I think the norm is going to become hybrid plans where folks are in the office a couple days a week but cant fully live anywhere they want,jakdak,16296461930,43

h9zjtur,p9dd93,I have lifelong friendships and business references from working with people in an office It sounds great maybe if you are young and still in touch with school/university people for your social life Even having offices move to WFH seems great because all your coworkers are in the same area and you already have closer bonds from knowing them in-person so even over video it seems a bit more fun Well over time workers will come and go and fewer and fewer new hires will be "local" to you Though you will have social "zoom meetings" it just wont have the same impact For the past 6 years Ive worked either remotely or with a large part of the team being remote so COVID wasnt the start of this for me As Ive noticed almost nobody keeps in touch after changing jobs from these remote teams Apart from perhaps a reference for a job application there is little to zero contact No long term friendships no long term anything Sure sometimes when someone would move to a new job you might chat quite a bit talk about things but usually those fizzle to zero rather quickly However I have plenty of friends held for decades gained from working together in person We still go out to hang talk over voice and chat play online and in-person games grab some drinks or see a show Those remote people on the "Chicago Team" of a job from five years ago I struggle to remember their names now Long term this will probably damage cities and urban centers Think the rise of the automobile and massive efficient highways created suburban sprawl? Hold your beer for the new WFH economy The continent will likely become coast to coast suburbs with neighbors with tall fences who hardly know each other Its okay you can watch movies in your home You can watch sports in your home You can see concerts in your home You can have your groceries delivered Fine dining some driving service will bring you food from that local restaurant if it really exists Perhaps Taco Bell now? Welcome to your home your prison I cant wait for the downvotes here I can almost smell them Of course some of what I am saying might not completely come to be but without a doubt its a strong possibility I guarantee this first taste of 100% remote working seems great now but long term the unintended consequences have not been fully considered And by the time those consequences are more strongly realized it would probably be impossible to go back to the office or at least a long uphill battle,RedditRage,16296866320,2

What an informed financial move! Nothing like a little snow around Christmas either right? Well then we can certainly use your San Diego level salary somewhere else in the company!"

h9y46xe,p9dd93,Good All these companies claim that they want to be environmentally friendly carbon neutral and a safe place for their workers are just a bunch of hypocrite tools However when a GOLDEN opportunity as we have now presents itself to effectively change the *status quo* and achieve all those goals they get cold feet and wanna go back to their "one trick pony show" The sad thing is that there are no excuses: all the communication technologies required to these sweeping changes exists and the employees welcome the change But I reckon most managers are terrified of these changes since it would make painfully clear that some (not all) are just "disposable heroes" that bring zero value to the bottom line On the other hand the Corporate Real-estate lobby - with many billions at stake - is just too strong to let this happen without a fight,optimal_random,16296621230,1

h9yvza3,p9dd93,Forbes stated 5+ years ago that "Management Resistance" was the #1 problem with remote work not productivity or the technology Execs want their big offices perks and to be far away from their spouses all day And also many are crap at managing remotely vs slightly younger tech-savvy GenX/Millennials,TheSimpler,16296748240,1
h9yw6au,p9dd93,Heres my take as a member of the Executive team: a huge majority of the staff does not have to come into the office for the company to continue to run smoothly and be successful We announced that "If you want to come back let your direct manager know by X date If not no problem" Were a 500 person company 200 were already remote Of the 300 remaining 70-ish wanted to come back We save money in the long run and have happier staff (as of now) On the flip side there is absolutely less off-the-cuff collaboration That stifles creativity and perhaps innovation but not to the point that its worth mandating Another angle is that remote worker put in much more time since there is no finality to the end I prefer a balance personally I go in Monday - Wednesday EDIT: If youre in Sales and your manager/company is forcing you back in then its time to quit They dont trust you and want to babysit activity,makgeolliandsoju,16296749170,1

h9yy9je,p9dd93,I like working from home and I definitely hope itll continue to be a normal part of work during and "after" Covid-19 However I think people are generally a bit to quick to sing its praises The advantages for those that have work thats suited for it have established relationships with colleagues and dont struggle with work-related psychological challenges are obvious But for some it makes their work a lot harder without extra pay For some its really hard to get to know their colleagues in a new workplace and become a real part of a team And for some they now suffer in isolation and invisibly slip into deeper problems with nobody around to ask "are you OK?" Thats not to say we should move back into the offices like nothing changed - but businesses should be pushed into dealing with these problems before they become big problems The companies youll want to work for are the companies that get working from home right,grismar-net,16296759310,1

ha04grb,p9dd93,This is something I suggested to my company in the UK: Hi folks Ive given some consideration to this and would like to suggest the below rules to satisfy a flexible work offering to the SD: I have based this on: 23 SD staff (8x 24/7 engineers 15x Core shift) Image Image Image Each engineer must come in 40% of their time Each day there must be at least 5 people physically on rotad shift Each day there must be no more than 10 engineer on schedule We split the WFH days in any given week between a choice of Monday+Tuesday or Thursday+Friday This grants opportunity of "extended weekend feeling" to all Q: Why 40% submission to physical occupation? A: TeamLead stated Service Desk requires an obligatory 15% physical office presence on any working day Q: How does this impact skill availability? A: It doesnt this is based purely on resource as we have availability across core teams in the working week On average we will have 8 engineers physically within the office space Q: How this is managed? A: Either by a scheduling app/portal where engineers self-sign up (first come first serve) and commit to fulfilling their weekly hours or assigned by TLs Q: How does this solution address 24/7 flexibility? A: Whilst 24/7 day shift must attend the office space 24/7 night shift fulfil duties from home Any 24/7 day shift falling on a weekend is fulfilled from home This is open to your adjustments or leave as is in the pot for discussion and practical application for the business Thanks" Glad to say this has now been adopted  Before COVID happened my company was on target to turn 200m so they purchased a new HQ for 15m We are an IT Managed Service Provider The company had plans to go global looking for offices in the USA They signed the contract grace period passed and then COVID happened They were unable to back out of the deal and have since been working within regulations of UK lockdowns and government guidance to continue with the new head office plan We have lost only 1 employee during this pandemic and that was after he contracted Covid after major surgery Work load has increased the employment demand at our company due to demand from clients working remotely and other IT projects Due to Covid theyve put the expansion on the back burner for now and are cautiously monitoring markets and of course Covid itself They still want to expand to the US Fingers crossed!  As we have hospitals and government clients for technical support we were actually classed as support workers and got full 80% furlough offered but we didnt need to take it Covid has just sped up the work from home culture and those that do not change their ways are set to lose good employees Mental health has been cited as one of the major drivers with a large majority of workers being effected I personally have been wfh social distancing and wearing a mask in public since 2019 when my wife started chemotherapy after a mastectomy So this has been the norm for us long before Covid came along I do think there is a need for a physical space a lot of clients say the office is a place to separate home and work life Ive never had this as an issue in fact I am blessed that I have seen my son grow up since his birth in 2019 I get to spend time playing with him look after my wife and be home "on time" or work late if I want to An hour here and there longer doesnt kill me in fact I believe I start earlier and finish on time or happy to work later I think sales people need that physical connection and banter with their colleagues its the nature of that beast I know from a lot of clients and other companies I interviewed for that WFH was a massive positive to performance and output but over time people have got complacent or lazy and now efficiency is actually on the back slide WFH is definitely here to stay to what degree and capacity offered is another thing Ps feel free to use my wfh flexible working plan ,PrimarisBA,16296996010,1

ha2d7eg,p9dd93,Im in IT and everything I do can be done remotely On those ultra-rare occasions a server doesnt come back up or theres something that requires a brief on-site I have coworkers in the Austin area who gladly volunteer to go to the office I live 86 miles from the office in San Antonio You gain so much from working from home and it enriches your life and finances Financially I reallocated my previous vehicle expenses towards building a maintenance account for the car and now am placing small amounts away for whenever the car needs replacement which wont be soon as its a 7 year-old car with only 40k on the odometer What frightens me is that so many retirement accounts and other investments are using REITs and if holding companies start to go under due to unleased office space that may drive companies to migrate back into offices again That movement and how rapidly it is migrated to would depend on the market overall REITs are not always the safe haven theyve been portrayed as from some insiders Ive spoken to There is also much anxiety with middle-management over not being able to manage what you dont see While remote monitoring software adoption is increasing these middle managers arent the least bit tech-savvy and such applications intimidate the hell out of them Thus middle managers are paranoid their jobs are next on the chopping block something I am happy to see as theyve often been excluded from previous workforce culls At the end of the day the companys bottom line is all that counts If theyre saving tons of cash from not having to lease so much office space and middle management is suddenly redundant theres even more opportunity for profit by cutting them They were never essential to begin with and always an albatross in my opinion With work from home I never have to worry about leaving by x time to avoid traffic which in Austin is impossible If I have to work overtime or do something after hours its super-easy For those in the medical field I empathize with you greatly not mention deeply respect your daily efforts even when the public behaves like an ass My wife is a CRNA and doesnt have the luxury I do My fervent hope is that work from home doesnt come to an end and that weve seen the birth of a new form of work become permanent,pguschin,16297447470,1

h3yaqxw,ocwhp4,Im glad this is here because I didnt want to post and I cant So here is the thing before the pandemic I had asthma an issue I had struggled with all my life and more I constantly got sick starting usually with colds then respiratory infections walking neumona chronic sinus infections all of this before ultimately getting better and slowly starting the same cycle all over again from year to year with varying degrees of severity fluctuating throughout my life After 2020 specifically January or maybe December year previous I had come back home to Oregon because I was chronically ill and unable to eat food I had gone from 220lb to just 147 in two months That issue is still on going I only mention it to make known that I had previously been in a failed physical state as well prior to the outbreak When the outbreak occurred it did so in Hillsboro Oregon the city we lived in at the time and we had already been sick all of us with respiratory issues Something were all well familiar with and more and equipped to deal with it since it runs in the family It passed like nothing for my family but I as per usual began my long cycle starting with the initial cold step; however when it came to the respiratory infection step everything changed In the past my mucus at this point would be thick heavy and brown and it would make it extremely difficult and painful for me to remove it by force namely deliberately coughing it all up over and over again until all of it for that day was gone and then sleep rinse repeat until fully recovered people I am poor as SHIT! When its your whole Life! You find a way Anyways I got to that step but this time my mucus had changed It was now white like histamine light stringy and sticky This made it near impossible to cough out The only reason my method had worked in the past was because it was near solid when brown and I could use the muscles around my lungs to forcefully eject the solid mass once it had built to a certain level Now as right now it just stays as a light presence in my lungs but at that time I tried wildly to eject it to the point that I may have either dislocated my collar bone documented as having been dislocated as a child or my shoulder I dont know for sure I tried and failed but its ok I was for reasons I wont get into examined against my will at a hospital some time after these events and they cleared me as never having had the corona virus subsequently released from unmentioned hospital Since that time my mucus has not gone back to the way it was and Ive not gotten any colds sinus infections none of it I started gaining my weight back more my muscle is rebuilding with very little effort and I have not changed my diet I eat virtually nothing and I mean that I am daily on a starvation diet My wife currently is trying to follow me she is at 114lb meanwhile eating less than she does I currently am just under 180lb I ate steak two days ago I virtually only eat meat these days Here is what I know Prior to the outbreak I was withering and I had been fighting respiratory issues my whole life despite making more than the usual effort to maintain my health through rigorous diet and exercise which had wained in the last three years leading up due to family a child full time work and marital stress Currently I am demonstrably better No changes to my diet since 2019 which consist of regular daily fasting only drinking milk sometimes mixed with peanut butter and a banana once or twice daily and occasionally red meat and sea life No changes to my family whom I still continue to struggle with daily weighting heavily on my psyche Ive been out of work since 2019 so that has not changed but things overall in my family and my living situation has improved Nevertheless the bigger factory being diet has not changed but my mucus has Im writing this while caring for my eight month old son one of two so spare me some consideration here if youre still reading lol in conclusion I got better after the pandemic and although I was told I had not been infected I believe that I was and I also believe that Ive overall as a life form become stronger as a result Im changing physically and physiologically for my betterment and that makes me genuinely wonder if vaccinating myself against these possible natural dangers is not the wrong way to go? Are we not looking for that key to open the door to the next phase of biological evolution? Or are we just waiting for Elon and machines to make things easy for us?

hb1o56y,pf4633,Moderna Incs Covid vaccine generated more than double the antibodies of a similar shot made by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE in research directly comparing immune responses to the inoculations A study of almost 2500 workers at a major Belgium hospital system found antibody levels among individuals who hadnt been infected with the coronavirus before getting two doses of the Moderna vaccine averaged 2881 units per milliliter compared with 1108 units/mL in an equivalent group who got two jabs of the Pfizer shot The results published Monday in a letter to the Journal of the American Medical Association suggested the differences might be explained by the: higher amount of active ingredient in the Moderna vaccine -- 100 micrograms versus 30 micrograms in Pfizer-BioNTech longer interval between doses of the Moderna vaccine -- four weeks versus three weeks for Pfizer-BioNTech Modernas vaccine was associated with a two-fold risk reduction against breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to Pfizers in a review of people in the Mayo Clinic Health System in the US from January to July The results were reported in a separate study released ahead of publication and peer review on Aug 9,actualtext,16304105170,2894

What is acceptable line for antibodies? What is rate of decline? For example if you need 50 antibodies per nanoliter to be effective but pfizer gives 500 and moderna 990 then its moot If on day 14 pfizer is 400 and moderna is 600 then on day 60 pfizer is200 and moderna is 202 And so on Thats why hospitizations and death are good clinical outcomes Both vaccines work great Period Otherwise you would see huge jumps in hospitalizations from the pfizer group Honestly out of the 8000 or so hospitalized or dead and completely vaccinated how many are moderna vs pfizer? Also 75% of those are 65 and up So that means they were more likely to get pfizer before moderna was approved So even then you would have to account for accessibility Studies like this dont really help except to get researchers more funding,justjoshingu,16304292650,6

Vaccines are working So honestly the death data leads me to believe there are waaaaay less people in the ICU vs last year Not sure Im buying these drama headlines or why the hospitals are struggling this year vs last And Mass general on their own website stated they have ICU capacity as of 12/24 https://datargjcom/covid-19-hospital-capacity/facility/massachusetts-general-hospital/220071/ Now Im sure the holiday surge probably pushed those numbers up but look at last year the same time frame They had 157 ICU beds last Christmas They now have 147 Theyve lost 9% of their beds (probably due to staff having Covid) But that isnt exactly a crisis and they still appear to have capacity But just saying do the research for yourself and come to your own conclusions Then again its Reddit and no one gives a $&@% A sensationalistic headline gets way more clicks even if the article is offering alternative facts and people have an attention span of an ant So who cares right? Im gonna save this mass general link so I can check the data for next week Not reaching a conclusion yet but based on this data Im leaning towards "yes this is a problem but its not the end of the world crisis the internet makes you believe" EDIT: and honestly the EMT post below was asking who to blame? Look at the Mass General link and how much capacity they had last Nov they over shot offering 210+ beds Operating at half capacity is not profitable for the hospital so it makes sense they would scale down and run at capacity If youre looking for someone to blame clearly this is hospital managements problem Theyve underestimated the demand for ICU beds and werent able to scale up fast enough Granted this is an extremely difficult thing to predict Who knew right? But this in essence is where the problem lies The inability of hospitals to accurately predict the demand for ICU beds 2 months ahead and scale capacity accordingly,888Kraken888,16413995890,27

gwja6gl,n2hns4,**Michigan is now hospitalizing more people under 40 than those over 80 for COVID-19** Dr Stacey Sensor says her 18-year-old son a high school senior is "one of the healthiest people I know" "He works out every single day at five oclock in the morning" said Sensor a Gaylord physician "He takes all these supplements He only eats healthy And he got COVID at the gym "He was quite sick for about eight days" she said "So Im telling you that it doesnt matter what supplements you take what your age is Even in the healthiest individual they still can get it and they can still become very sick and then the effects can be there for quite some time" Its a cautionary tale she said for people who see COVID-19 as a serious health threat for the elderly but a much more benign illness for younger healthier people In fact Michigans current coronavirus surge has turned that assumption on its head: Last week the state was averaging more hospital admissions for COVID patients under 40 than patients age 80 or older The former was about 78 a day compared to 50 for the latter according to data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services The biggest reason for the demographic shift experts say: The difference in vaccination rates About 74% of Michigan residents age 70 and older have gotten at least one dose of vaccine and two-thirds are fully vaccinated For those 16 to 49 the numbers are 36% who have gotten one dose and 23% fully immunized; there is no vaccine authorized for children under 16 Also contributing to the surge of virus among young people is the spread of variants that are both more contagious and more lethal; the tendency of many younger adults to disregard COVID-19 guidelines and the fact that schools have reopened "Its definitely become more of a young person disease now probably because they havent been vaccinated and theyve been more likely than older folks to go out and about be in close contact with others and go to gatherings" said Dr Mark Hamed a physician who is medical director for Huron Lapeer Sanilac Tuscola Alcona Iosco Ogemaw and Oscoda counties The numbers bear that out In the first year of the pandemic Michigan residents age 60 and older accounted for 23% of cases; its now 13% Conversely those under age 20 accounted for 13% of cases during the first 12 months of the pandemic; its now 25% The chart below shows the April case numbers by age group compared to the monthly average through March 2021 as well as compared to December 2020 during the fall surge [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/WNTiwqVd1gGfPM09p2D0qzVgFZY=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/VQGMMSPTZNGADOVJQPKGAWILMQPNG) In theory thats actually a welcomed shift from the standpoint that old age is easily the biggest risk factor for being hospitalized or dying of COVID-19 But experts have been taken aback by the spike in COVID-19 hospitalizations among younger adults and children Compared to the height of the fall surge in early December Michigans average daily hospitalization admissions for COVID-19 are up 33% for those age 18 to 29 58% for thirty-somethings and 64% for those in their 40s Meanwhile hospitalizations for those age 80 and older are down 60% compared to December [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/86v1e7Apdm4-zWbHd-9Q7X4rAh0=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/RPEUG3IW5JGXTF6HQYL2RBK67Upng) "Its like you take what we were seeing before and shift it down by one or two decades" said Dr Joel Fishbain an infectious disease specialist for Beaumont Hospital in Grosse Pointe "Weve got 20-year-olds who are getting admitted and 30-year-olds requiring oxygen which we never saw before and needing as much treatment as we can give them Weve got 40- and 50-year-olds ending up on ventilators" Pediatric cases also are up Last week the state was averaging almost 10 hospital admissions a day among pediatric patients with COVID-19 triple the number in mid-February Deaths among children and younger adults have spiked too In the first 13 months of the pandemic there were six deaths among children ages 10 to 19 In the past month four deaths were reported Another 65 deaths were reported in April for 20- and 30-somethings quadruple the monthly average The chart below compares April deaths to the monthly average through March 2021 as well as to confirmed COVID deaths in December The numbers show how deaths among seniors plummeted in April compared to December as a result of vaccinations while coronavirus variants spiked deaths among unvaccinated people under age 50 [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/caQyJGE9C2BiswUM2ThU22RJumk=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/ZXCIGC7VWZCN7H65ULFSFE4GPIPNG) Deaths and hospitalizations arent the only concern While most COVID patients under age 50 "dont get severely ill there are a growing number of people who have long-haul COVID symptoms" said Dr Liam Sullivan an infectious disease specialists with Spectrum Health in Grand Rapids "They have problems with smelling with taste with concentration with memory with fatigue with night sweats "So even though they had a mild illness the first time around theyre still dealing with these things month and months later and thats not something you want to deal with when youre 25 or 35" he said "Of course you dont want to deal with it at any age but especially when youre in the prime of your life" And for women the research is growing on the dangers of COVID-19 during pregnancy Dr Kurt Wharton an Oakland County obstetrician currently has four pregnant patients in intensive care units battling COVID-19 All four are "fighting for their lives" said Wharton who works at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak While COVID-19-related deaths among pregnant women remain very rare Wharton and others say the evidence is growing that coronavirus during pregnancy can put a woman at a much higher risk of preterm birth preeclampsia and admission to the ICU and/or intubation especially if the woman has pre-existing conditions such as high blood pressure obesity diabetes or heart disease Evidence growing on COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy: Virus is dangerous; the shots are not Doctors offer several theories on why more younger people are getting significantly ill with COVID-19 in the current surge One is the spread of variants which are both more contagious and more lethal The variants are "stickier" Hamed said which means it takes less exposure to make someone severely ill or even symptomatic Wharton noted the same pattern happened during the 1918 influenza pandemic The initial surge in the spring of 1918 primarily impacted the elderly and babies But the virus mutated and came roaring back in the fall of 1918 and its primary victims during that surge were younger adults "History is repeating itself" Wharton said Another issue suggests Hamed and others: More unvaccinated people are gathering in groups without masks That increases the risk of exposure to a higher viral load which has been associated with more severe disease "The best mask you wear the less viral load you inhale" Wharton said On top that many schools have reopened and children and younger adults in particular are resuming their pre-pandemic social lives "You can see it" Wharton said "Younger people are all out in groups again walking down sidewalks shopping going to restaurants and bars together They just think theyre invulnerable" The good news is that COVID-19 vaccinations have proven "wildly successful" in significantly reducing the chances of getting the virus and spreading to others Sullivan said And just as vaccinations have blunted spread of the virus among senior citizens the spread of COVID among younger adults can be stymied through immunization shots Vaccination programs "really need to target the younger people right now" Sensor said "Theyre the ones who are getting sick Weve done a really good job of vaccinating our older population but to really move forward and get out of this pandemic we really need our younger people to step up to the plate and get the vaccine to protect themselves and protect their families",itsdr00,16198732450,154

h9pnz04,p8e6s6,"The Food and Drug Administration is pushing to approve Pfizer-BioNTechs two-dose Covid-19 vaccine on Monday further expediting an earlier timeline for licensing the shot according to people familiar with the agencys planning Regulators were working to finish the process by Friday but were still working through a substantial amount of paperwork and negotiation with the company The people familiar with the planning who were not authorized to speak publicly about it cautioned that the approval might slide beyond Monday if some components of the review need more time An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment The agency had recently set an unofficial deadline for approval of around Labor Day The approval is expected to pave the way for a series of vaccination requirements by public and private organizations who were awaiting firmer regulatory backing before implementing mandates Federal and state health officials are also hoping that an approved vaccine will draw interest from some Americans who have been hesitant to take one that was only authorized for emergency use a phenomenon suggested by recent polling Some universities and hospitals are expected to mandate inoculation once a vaccine is fully approved The Pentagon earlier this month said it plans to make Covid vaccinations mandatory for the countrys 13 million active-duty troops "no later" than the middle of next month or sooner if the FDA acts earlier The timing of the approval could result in an uncomfortable messaging problem for the Biden administration which on Wednesday announced that fully vaccinated people should prepare to get booster shots eight months after they received second doses Approving the vaccine and encouraging boosters at the same time may suggest to some that the vaccine as licensed is inadequate without an extra shot The FDA last week updated its authorizations of Pfizer-BioNTechs and Modernas vaccine to allow third doses for some immunocompromised people a decision backed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Regulators are still reviewing Modernas application for full approval for its coronavirus vaccine and a decision could come at least several weeks after the one for Pfizer-BioNTech",urbanpencil,16294944330,203

hdlacvc,prsbj3,The headlines are skewing this VERY positively This is actually not very reassuring data in terms of likelihood getting the vaccine approved There wasnt enough COVID observed particularly severe illness/hospitalization to determine clinical efficacy which is why they had to use antibody response as a surrogate endpoint Antibody levels are not a very good measure of real world clinical efficacy and its unclear what they mean and how much benefit they actually confer particularly in children The FDA may have a hard time issuing the EUA in the coming weeks with the data we have now and I wouldnt at all be surprised if they ask for more After all EUA stands for **Emergency** Use Authorization and the virus hardly qualifies as an emergency in children based on this data Id love to argue that its an emergency in adults and vaccinating kids would help but in general we have a real tough time approving interventions in kids without evidence of much direct benefit to them particularly under EUA I know Im gonna get downvoted for this but Im a resident pediatrician and I truly wanted this to work more than anyone Disappointed with how the data shook out At the same time I wouldnt want anything to be approved without CLEAR evidence that the benefit outweighs the risk and its hard to say we have enough data to determine that at this time,chocoholicsoxfan,16321461530,50

hda1xrc,pq0mfs,IMO this is a bad policy because it puts the onus of checking vaccination status on some of the lowest paid and overworked employees of all Often these people speak English as a second language as well If the state wants to mandate a vaccine then the state should be the one to enforce it as well For example cops patrol and give out speeding tickets I dont have to chase down reckless drivers and ticket them,No-Amoeba217,16319278000,1

hdap4rv,pq0mfs,If politicians are going to strong arm restaurant workers to do the dirty work of enforcing covid precaution policies then they need to step up and give them more protections from abuse from a partially hostile and dangerous minority of the public There needs to be increased penalties for this type of behavior or restaurants should refuse to cooperate whenever someone puts up any resistance Instead they should just seat them and quietly call the police and report them If anybody tries to ticket them for serving them food then you have it on record that you reported it to the police to be dealt with but the police didnt do anything about it so you felt unsafe refusing service to a potentially hostile person without a police presence for protection to trespass the patron Eventually the police unions will get sick of thousands of calls a day to deal with diners who refuse masks or providing proof of vaccination and they will vet the policy reversed because god forbid we task law enforcement with enforcing pandemic control measures instead of restaurant hostesses,kismetschmizmet,16319405890,1

They are just trying to scare people we dont even have that here" Along with "they just want to scare people into wearing masks again or getting the vaccine" or something along those lines About 1-2 weeks ago our state (ND) reported they found people with the omicron variant one or two of the people hadnt ever even traveled outside of the state for a long time Plus its been reported Omicron variant spreads much faster it sounds like But no cant be omicron variant here Plus what would those doctors and scientists know its not like they went to specialized schools and learned that kind of stuff Plus pretty sure a guy who only graduated from high school and only got his position cause no one else wanted it nor the fact not many people were all that much qualified for it got it Pretty sure he knows better then those doctors/scientists -_- I need to figure out where I want to move to to get out of this crapy place,iamfuturetrunks,16408430160,1

Absolutely not! Weve been saying things like "Wear masks they arent perfect but every little bit helps" "Skip christmas every little bit helps" "get vaccinated every little bit helps"and then we turn around say "You know what nevermind everyone come on back to work even though we KNOW some of you will STILL be contagious" Funny how only individuals are asked to sacrifice to make every little bit help,Krytan,16416687040,9

According to the article roughly 15% of patients are covid+ I dont know exactly but that seems like a reasonably expected share of patients for any general hospital in the United states right now Maybe even on the low side actually 2 - The article never says how many covid+ patients the hospital had before those asymptomatic workers came in It would be useful to know if it went from 8 to 28 or 24 to 28 A significant detail left out 3 - The article also fails to actually say how many of the infected patients had tested positive on admission or how many of them were already admitted prior to the asymptomatic workers being there I dont know how things work in Rhode Island but in Ohio anyone who is going to be admitted to any hospital must be covid tested I dont think its required by law its just become standard procedure for hospital systems This seems like total clickbait They got me good!,chad-proton,16417434670,1

h0jsums,nrqtko,Ive worked tending bar or retail since 1991 Interact within 1 meter of hundreds of people a day for 30 years Used to catch every respiratory infection going Used to think Flu must be incredibly rare though because Ive only spent a week in bed wishing I was dead twice in those 30 years What I learnt during Covid is that there are in-fact Asymptomatics to the Flu too and people whos immune system deal with it quickly and effectively that never get uber sick with it and a flu for them ends up feeling just like a bad cold to many/most other people whereas for many/most people a Flu will floor them and send them to their beds for a week or more and make them wish they were dead Anyway havent had a single respiratory infection since about 2013 Not one!! ie No sore throats no weakness fatigue fevers chills sinus congestion blowing shit of of my nose every 10 minutes etc etc All that exposure over all those years to every single Rhino/Adeno/Corona/Flu virus going has probably rendered me immune to nearly every variant of all the common respiratory infections out there or certainly given my immune system all the tools or headstarts it needs to deal with most things out there Ive just spent 18 months serving hundreds a day with no mask but a plexiglass screen between me and the mostly mask wearing customers in my well ventilated convenience store where the permanently open door is 2m from the service counter where the register is All of the above likely did their part but in all likelihood I probably still caught Covid but was Asymptomatic thanks to all that previous respiratory infection exposure especially the cold causing corona-virii Only other explanation I can think of is my Vaping Switched to vaping in 2013 Perhaps all that Propylene Glycol coating my respiratory tract and lungs was a very effective barrier against all the endemic respiratory infections over the last 8 years and all those nicotine molecules plugged into my ACE2 receptors slowed the replication of SarsCov2 long enough for my immune system to eradicate it before I became symptomatic Sill going to get Vaccinated (Pfizer) tomorrow though!

h0la381,nrqtko,Every year just before the height of flu season we should have a national pandemic preparedness week where we mask up in public work/school from home if we can and get people accustomed to what needs to be done when theres a virus going around Sure COVID is a once-a-century thing but that doesnt mean another similar virus cant happen in 1 5 or 10 years Heck with variants Id say were more likely than ever to have a new pandemic next year Getting kids educated about how to act during a pandemic should be as common as lessons on "stop drop and roll" Additional benefit of having everyone across the country do this is we could put a significant dent in the number of flu cases and flu deaths,trevdak2,16228279610,0

I feel like this is becoming more and more apparent as healthcare workers quit How are they obligated to provide health care to ungrateful and non-compliant individuals risking their own health? In my experience healthcare is a risky and oftentimes brutal struggle against death It can be painful humiliating and traumatizing Which is why sometimes patients refuse treatment Describing it as a human right is just ridiculous When there is no one left to provide this "right" then what happens?

Am I fine with the first two shots? If someone is just now getting vaccinated should they take all three in the shortest window of time thats recommended?

hqripxf,rt54vc,TLDR; If youre using an antigen at-home rapid test wait until 2-3 days after symptom onset (but quarantine before then ofc) Family of 4 (50M 14F 16F 22F (myself)) We were exposed to COVID either on Christmas or the 26th (a close family friend (50Ms girlfriends son 15M with whom he was in the car with for 3+hours on the 26th) had a fever on the 26th confirmed positive PCR test on the 28th) Weve been quarantining since the 26th Day 0: 50M 16F and I took a QuickVue antigen test on the 28th They were all negative At this point 50M had a scratchy throat and was mildly coughing The rest of us had no symptoms I started getting a tickly throat (that feeling of "oh here it comes") late at night Didnt test 14F that night because the tests arent cheap :) and we were quarantining anyways At this point if one of us had it the rest of us did Day 1: The next morning 14F woke up with a fever Myself and 16F woke up with sore throats a headache fatigue and coughing 50M stayed the same I felt pretty rough that night had intense night-sweats and lots more coughing 14F broke her fever half-way through the day Day 2: 14F and 16F are feeling much better! Yay! Hardly any symptoms just mild coughing and runny nose I have worse coughing fatigue scratchy throat runny nose nausea 50M doing pretty much the same as he was--just a scratchy throat and coughing At this point its just been a bad cold for us or akin to a case of bronchitis We all took more at-home tests: 2 QuickVue 2 BinaxNOW All 4 came back positive Day 3 (today): 50M lost his sense of smell dampened sense of taste This didnt happen during his first run with COVID (April 2020) Still has similar symptoms but theyve gotten better Im doing much better still occasionally coughing & headaches/cold symptoms 14F and 16F are practically symptom-free now just a bit of coughing 14F and 16F were 2x Pfizer vaccinated in June 2021 (date of second dose) 50M was 2x Moderna vaccinated in January 2021 but caught COVID early-on from hospital work in April 2020 Was a fairly severe case lasted 15 months but no hospitalization I was vaccinated 2x Pfizer in April 2021 None of us received the booster yet I think we all caught Omicron as the symptoms are relatively mild 14F 16F and I have never had COVID before A bit sad we caught it after 2 years of not catching it 50M isnt as cautious with masking/avoiding crowded areas procedures as we are Some anecdotal evidence if you will We all tested negative the first round of testing and all tested positive the second round of testing So you may want to wait until 2-3 days after the start of symptoms before you do an at-home test Best of luck to everyone!

hqsktkf,rt54vc,I currently have covid very likely omicron (though I dont know for sure Im sharing symptoms with confirmed omicron cases and not with og/delta cases) and I think there must be an issue with detection and early testing I was symptomatic for four days before I tested positive (symptoms started afternoon of 25th and my lateral flow came back positive on 29th - I then took a pcr test on 30th which was also positive) Alarmingly though I tested negative twice with lateral flow tests on 26th and 27th and also had a negative result from a pcr test taken on 26 And Ive heard of long gaps between infection and testing positive increasingly in the last two weeks Technically given the negative pcr test on the 26th I could have gone back to work and my symptoms would have been dismissed as cold symptoms which is what I think is contributing to the spread People arent testing positive negative quickly and especially if they are asymptomatic are going into the community and unknowingly infecting people in the days before they test positive Fortunately someone else in my household (we think the person who became infected first and so was further into it) tested positive so we just decided to ignore the test results and isolate to be cautious,thatstoomuchsauce,16410330480,3

ha7111a,pamuzn,after pumping the message of "get vaxed resume life" nonstop putting a new message like this out there which will be interpreted as: "on an individual level theres an undefined amount of additional work to be done afterwards and then maybe well see" is counterproductive imo we cant get double the vaccines in our arms to make up for the stubborn idiots we cant put twice the amount of masks on to make up for the people that dont wear them and we cant lockdown twice as hard for the idiots that partied on spring break throughout the previous peaks reward good reward and punish bad the work that still needs to be done is with local leaders hospitals setting policy companies setting policy for staff etc pivoting from "get vaccinated resume life" to "get vaccinated require vaccines for those ready to resume life resume life" seems like an easier more actionable pivot to accomplish something (besides just inspiring defeatism) than "get vaccinated hope that the dumbest lowlifes catch on eventually and maybe next year you get to live again but stay tuned" on a community level if we could require vaccines/proof of negative tests to participate in "normal" life sooner i think hammering that message would do more to incentivize individuals than when only looking at things nationally/globally good luck getting the crowd that has already done everything more or less right during quarantines mandates etc to continue paying attention while they watched a bunch of hicks bury their heads in the sand cancel out any progress and continue to stay tuned in after already sacrificing a year of life i know its complicated but seems so counterproductive not to spend time also highlighting the spots in the country that succeeded and have been able to have more normalcy already and to balance the national/international gloom and doom with the stark contrast from the cities and communities that have done it right look at floridas deaths currently surpassing the deaths of their previous peaks LONG AFTER A VACCINE HAS BEEN WIDELY AVAILABLE TO THEIR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS (eg 999% of the people that die from covid) then look at the cities that have reached 60-70%+ fully vaxed having music festivals outdoors with no burden on hospital capacity and (except for those highly at risk to begin with those in nursing homes or in healthcare or education) apart from slapping a mask on in an uber and grocery store already are back to normal it was (supposed to be) a team effort until there was a vaccine available for the most at risk which many never participated in or actively sabotaged while others did their part but now that there is a vaccine for the majority of the population and the majority of older folks have gotten it it isnt going to be a one-size-fits-all approach for each individual: qualifying for a vaccine vax rates in the individuals community co-morbidity occupation contact (or lack of contact) with at-risk or groups that cant yet get vaccinated all realistically play more of a role on how much "normal" you get to have the broader context is necessary but its an increasingly hard sell in healthy vaccinated populations to continue to buckle down seemingly endlessly when life itself is insanely short my community has done what it takes and it makes no sense to send a message to the group that has followed marching orders to now wait for the lowlifes in florida to catch up and then maybe u get your normal well be getting boosters before they get a faction of these morons vaccinated fuck em i think about all my friends that own businesses in chicago that barely stayed afloat before there was a vaccine reading this seeing this new "maybe" date (when it could instead be as simple as letting businesses set a policy to reward folks for getting vaccinated) because of some downstate/out of state hillbillies and it makes me sick,lisaleftsharklopez,16298309000,4

The Corona Cabinet approved: Insulation for returnees from abroad African variant Omicron (Photo: Reuters) South Africa has transferred new information to Israel - and this is the data | Photo: Reuters The contradictory messages of vaccine manufacturers The test of the effectiveness of existing vaccines against the new variant was in its infancy but Modern CEO Stefan Bensel managed to arouse global concern today when he said in an interview with the Financial Times that he expects a significant decrease in vaccine efficacy But Bensel spoke of a decline in benefit from a disease with symptoms rather than a serious illness - a difference that is known to be dramatic in corona contexts as Pfizer CEO Albert Burla was apt to describe: Defense compared to Delta but that would be the limit In both cases the booster vaccines are expected to reduce the gap dramatically " Burla who promised to know more about the benefits of the vaccine against the variant in about a week and a half said Pfizer had already begun developing a specific vaccine against the variant a few days ago "We know the genetic linkage of the virus we have it - thats how it starts" he explained "We started at risk to produce a vaccine We actually started on Friday to produce a vaccine based on the flooring the DNA template that would allow us to make RNA that would eventually women within that vaccine" Israel meanwhile is waiting for a more categorical statement from the two CEOs and meanwhile relies on data coming from South Africa - where the variant was first discovered - and from which it appears that the omicron is more contagious but is no more violent "Data on the benefits of the vaccine - there may be some partial data from South Africa" Dr Sharon Elrai-Price head of public health services said today during a debate in the Knesset I know they are doing the lab tests as I described to see how useful the vaccine against this variant is " Bennett worried: "There is a lot of uncertainty" Albert Burla and Naftali Bennett (Adapted by Reuters) Burla optimistic Bennett explains why he activated the GSS | Arrangement: Reuters At the same time the government is today approving a memorandum of law that will allow it to extend the decision to allow the GSS to verify the cellular devices of those infected with Omicron or the suspects who were infected with it with high probability - in order to interrupt the transmission chains as quickly as possible But just before the move reaches the Knesset the coalition itself is sharply critical of the law Prime Minister Bennett - who saw for himself how in the ministers WhatsApp groups Ministers Saar Shasha-Bitton Barbibai and Avidar voted against - told today why Israel decided to include the GSS in the campaign despite and perhaps because it is a low number of infected "There is a lot of uncertainty and that is why we are taking these extreme measures" he said in a video call with Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schlenberg "But our advantage as leaders is that once we know more when there is more information - we can let go of those measures gradually" As for the restrictions at Ben Gurion Airport the prime minister has already decided that these will last about two weeks from the date of the decision - and only if the final proof does come that the variant does not endanger the populations immunity or the omicron is already spread in the community - these restrictions will be removed Yaron Avraham participated in the preparation of the article,Serenity101,16383425550,2

hnflckn,r9otza,Ive been teaching in China for 18 years and this is par for the course Ill first say Ive always worked in the private sector and there have been times that Ive been outsourced to public schools on occasion while working with a few schools in the past What a gong show Not criticizing China Just humanity in general So I came **right** after the WHO lifted the SARS travel ban to China Id planned on moving to China earlier and SARS ended up delaying my departure by a few months There are always sick kids coming to school It really broke my heart Id see kids as young as 4 years old coming to class run down and sick It just made me think "if youre going to run your kid into the ground like this at this age what kind of physical condition can you expect them to be in when theyre 30?" When H1N1 was a thing I was working 3 afternoons a week at a high school and DAMN I had classes where students were constantly going to the bathroom to puke their guts out 1/4-1/3 of the students were clearly effected I constantly encouraged them to go home but they didnt see it as an option because their teachers and parents didnt accept the practice of saying home to get better and not risk spreading their illness to others A few years later I had a kid come to school looking kinda sick and before class I asked the girls mother and she upright admitted that she was aware that her child was infected with FMD which can be extremely fatal to humans who are younger/have less developed immune systems I couldnt believe this woman I informed my co-workers of the situation We immediately locked all of the classrooms because we didnt want anyone in the other classrooms to get infected It literally took over an hour to convince the mother to take her child out of the school It was literally impossible to convince her that shed done something wrong by taking her child outside let alone to a school filled with other younglings She attempted to fight the manager when we told her that she wouldnt be able to bring her child back into the school without proof from a local hospital that her daughter was no longer contagious After the insane woman left we spent a few hours sanitizing everything in the school It must have been a weird experience for the kids and teachers in the other classrooms They normally would have finished class a long time ago and would have been let out of the classroom for breaks but they had to just hang out in the classroom while we insured that wed done our best to make sure it was safe for the kids to come out TBH we shouldnt have had anything to do with this process There should have been some division of the government to contact to have them ensure that this is done properly especially given how this disease is famous for coming through areas and taking the lives of children in waves but yeah we didnt have such a luxury at our disposal COVID wasnt nearly as bad The government had clearly learned from SARS and figured out a way to deal with it in their own way After the COVID lockdown had ended it was really nice to see so many kids come to class wearing masks I even had co-workers wearing masks when they had a cold which is something I couldnt have imagined happening ever before COVID COVID really made me question why the hell we havent been wearing masks when under the weather all of these years I think it should be a given You shouldnt be free to spread your germs when youre feeling ill just regardless of whether or not you live in a free country,ThaddCorbett,16387743750,13

hngskpl,r9otza,Stuff like this keeps happening and will continue happening It seems like there are rarely any legal repercussions for it and often these people are insulated by their culture of willful ignorance There was an outbreak in my community that landed numerous people in the hospital and directly lead to a death (that we know of) And it was all due to extreme ignorance and negligence The short version: Family did not "believe in" taking covid precautions No masks no social distancing no vaccine etc They went to a large wedding and a short while later came down with symptoms of covid But rather than get tested or isolate they went on vacation during a busy holiday weekend (if memory serves correct) At some point after they got back and only after their symptoms got worse and other people from the wedding started testing positive for covid they got tested No surprise they had covid Despite the test results the father went into to work afterwards And if all that wasnt bad enough one of the family members died They held a large funeral service with at least a hundred and likely many more people than that where covid precautions were not enforced For the sake of argument I can see why folks might give the family the benefit of the doubt in regards to going on vacation while sick but not being 100% certain its covid However going to work after getting back positive test results is malicious and/or negligent and its crazy that there are no repercussions for doing that And having a large funeral in the middle of a local outbreak is reckless and so irresponsible I dont even know how that was allowed to happen,AnnieDickledoo,16388035760,1

h8g1hqm,p1oqh4,I believe its really important for parents to have an idea of the risks of COVID to children so Ive been doing some research recently to assess the risks **I am not an expert -- so I welcome any comments -- but thought this may be helpful as parents navigate this worrisome time** (sorry if youve seen this before -- Ive reposted this on threads that talk about kids and COVID because I think its important to have some idea behind the risks): **Morality Risks:** Obviously theres an extremely fine line to walk here: every death of a child is horrendously tragic and I cannot imagine being the parent of a child who has died or been hospitalized The good news for parents however is that mortality risks still remain low [Out of 74000000 kids in the US 519 have died of COVID since the crisis began (as of July 28)](https://wwwnytimescom/2021/07/29/well/family/back-to-school-covidhtml) This works out to a mortality rate of 00007% or 0015% amongst those who had had confirmed cases of COVID Again this is immensely tragic -- simply put no child should die -- but if I were a parent Id probably be more worried about the prospects for long-term COVID symptoms (discussed below) **Risks of Delta:** Delta is new so there is still much we do not know However data from the UK (where Delta has hit for some time now) gives us some clues Lets start with the good news: [based on data from the UK kids remain the least impacted age group by a long shot](https://wwwonsgovuk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19latestinsights/hospitals#hospital-admissions-by-age)Despite not having access to vaccines kids age 5-14 still have had by far the lowest hospitalization rates of any demographic (this past week its been 108/100000; kids age 0-4 have had noticeably higher rates -- 312/100k -- though still lower than any other age group) Similarly the chance a child would be hospitalized if they had a confirmed case of COVID was similar to prior waves and maybe even a little bit lower The bad news? Well more kids are going to get Delta on account of it being more transmissible particularly in areas where schools arent taking any precautions We all know it and were seeing it now but Delta is insanely more transmissible The fact were already seeing records for hospitalizations amongst kids is extremely bad to say the least The fact this is already occurring with no indications cases nationally are close to peaking is really troubling (An aside: interestingly the UK never break their record for youth hospitalizations with Delta but were breaking it now I really dont know but if anyone has insight itd be interesting to hear) **Risks of Long COVID/The Disease Course More Generally:** We still have lots to learn about long COVID and Delta is new enough that current studies dont really address it For COVID more generally however the earliest studies suggested frighteningly high rates of long-lasting symptoms (one even pegged it at a third!) But these suffered from immense methodological weaknesses such as low sample sizes parental-reported symptoms probable selection bias and no control groups More recent research (which isnt perfect and still includes many of the above weaknesses but is at least somewhat better) has suggested much lower rates than the first studies albeit the risks are real A sampling of some of the more recent work include: * [In a self-reported survey in the UK over 95% of infected kids had no symptoms lasting longer than four weeks and 98% had no symptoms more than 56 days](https://wwwthelancetcom/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext)(and if Im understanding the study correctly it only analyzed kids with symptomatic COVID so there would be lower rates for all infections) * [In a survey from the UK of people who had COVID an estimated 74% of children aged 2-11 reported any symptoms 12 weeks after infection](https://wwwonsgovuk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/prevalenceofongoingsymptomsfollowingcoronaviruscovid19infectionintheuk/1april2021) (this study included a control group) * [In one study with a control group researchers found that kids infected with COVID in Zurich actually were no more likely to report symptoms of long-COVID than kids who were not infected](https://wwwnaturecom/articles/d41586-021-01935-7)To be clear: this study does not imply that long-Covid does not occur However if true it suggests the actual prevalence of long-COVID in kids is likely quite low (This is definitely the most encouraging study I found) So whats the average course of the illness in most children (again with the caveat that most research is pre-Delta)? First off it seems that \~50% of children will be totally asymptomatic ([the Lancet study](https://wwwthelancetcom/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext) cites a source suggesting between 43-68% of cases are asymptomatic) Of those with symptoms the one study found the median symptom duration is 6 days with the most common symptoms being headache and fatigue (see previous link) Three final notes: First we need to be careful when discussing long-COVID and differentiate between symptoms that are bad but manageable (and resolve over time) and symptoms which are debilitating Unfortunately to my understanding current research has not really addressed this adequately In the Lancet study at least (first bullet point) the most common symptoms that lasted in the children who had lasting symptoms were 1) fatigue 2) loss of smell and 3) (to a lesser degree) headaches This doesnt really resolve the question -- depending on the levels of fatigue for example it certainly can be debilitating -- but I think this is something we really shouldnt lose sight of when discussing long-COVID Second: Ive seen concerns on here about organ damage and the like I havent really seen great studies focusing on this on children (I very well may have missed some so do not take this as gospel) Moreover in the studies Ive run across on adults theres lots of jargon and its not always clear what the medical implications of certain findings are Thus I havent really focused on it here -- not because it might not exist but because its above my expertise and I do not want to misinterpret findings Third risks -- even quantified -- are hard to interpret and people will probably have different reactions to the same numbers Lets say [the Lancet study](https://wwwthelancetcom/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext) (showing 18% of children with symptomatic COVID have any symptoms lasting >56 days) is correct On the one hand -- if your child catches COVID -- this means he/she is extremely unlikely to have symptoms that last that long One the other hand -- this still means lots of kids will have symptoms that last a long time **Takeaways:** Building off this last point: people will look at the above data and likely come to different conclusions For me I look at it and feel somewhat reassured -- its not at all that theres zero risk (theres definitely not) and whats currently happening is absolutely tragic but the data speaks to somewhat lower risks than the impression Id likely get if I spent my whole day on this sub But then again Im also not a parent Others may look at the data (particularly the long-COVID studies) and still very reasonably feel worried **In any event -- and I know Im preaching to the choir here -- the most important thing you can do to protect the kids around you is get vaccinated And if you happen to be a parent with a children age 12 or over whos on the fence please get them vaccinated too Itll protect your child from a truly nasty disease and help lower the risk for those around your child too**,Adodie,16286229860,6

hy5b95h,szo1gx,And no one cares I live in Louisiana and no one ever really took the virus seriously it was all a joke to a very very high percentage of the population here They will say that its not 1 million people that if you died of a car wreck the hospital marked you down as a covid death driving the numbers up Ive heard countless times from people say "well its just natural selection" and other BS like this To say I am ashamed is an understatement I am working on getting my family out of here to move somewhere more like minded I just cannot deal with the ignorance anymore,ESB1812,16456489110,170
hy64xwv,szo1gx,Its definitely not normal its a (hopefully) once in a century tragedy! The question is what else can we do? We locked down and started masking in hopes we drove the virus to extinction That didnt work so we kept that up until we had a vaccine available By this point there is a safe effective vaccine that everyone besides small children can get and theyll hopefully be able to get it in the coming months We even have antivirals to combat the virus Whats the goal now? Lockdowns and masks arent going to stop the virus just buy us time by slowing it down And now we no longer know what were buying time for The flu pandemic never really ended we just stopped treating it as exceptional; covid will be the same as hard as that is to accept,yozaner1324,16456605180,5
hy7g5tb,szo1gx,I dont know what to tell internet people except that for a lot of us COVID changed nearly nothing The jobs didnt let us go home the bills kept coming no checks came in the mail except for those two that everyone mocked for being silly and not even covering one month of rent Unless we wanted to quit and stay home (no unemployment checks for quitters in the US) there was no real choice except to carry on mask up and go to work Its been same crap different day since March 2020 Sometimes you hear about somebodys granny passing away or your coworker goes home with COVID for two weeks while you pick up the slack and then they come back and thats the end of it Theres been a huge mismatch between the online wailing about COVID and the actual experience of living with it and when I say living with it I mean week in and week out in one of the industries where we had higher COVID death rates than the medical people did Line cooks dont take masking very seriously Too high probably think 5G is the virus MOST of the US has been in this boat the entire time The poor Amazon workers didnt get a single day off they got overtime Only on the internet do people seem to live in this weird parallel universe defined by work from home and perpetual COVID measures Its been a hell of a thing to watch people act like thats normal It doesnt matter what I think of any of it I didnt even get to stay home from work for a week while I watched the whole world slam the shutters at once thats how much power I have Call me all the names you want Tell me Im stupid or whatever I have no control over your situation Outside of your bubble its been "normal" this entire time Its been two solid years of everyone carrying on more or less as usual The virus has somehow avoided presenting a face to the public that would make them treat it like a mortal threat the way things like Ebola did and the bosses arent letting anyone off the hook since they can all stay home safe if they wanna Youre the educated middle class not me Youre the ones who should have come up with some sort of way to force whatever it is youre wanting on the world Perpetual work from home? I dont know what you want You had the money resources safety and time to do something about it politically All I know is that everyone has been living in "normal" for a quarter of a decade except for you deaths or no deaths It seems that all your kind can really muster is thinkpieces like this one that tell everyone what they already know and that will fail to convince anyone who doesnt want to know Its just ineffective handwringing except for maybe this writer made a buck from it Maybe Mourn if you want to but theyre obviously going to drag you all back into the offices by your scruffs that or fire you Again its been "normal" since like June 2020 and it looks like its finally your turn at that shit sandwich Whatever the hell this is thats normal now,AttackPug,16456826160,6
hy5atbz,szo1gx,Sure there is Thats how evolution works Sure modern society has tried to change the rules but the battle for dominance and survival is complicated and sometimes brutal Survival is not guaranteed,SockPuppet-57,16456487490,3
hy7131i,szo1gx,Not saying this is normal but there will forever be no accurate total death count from Covid reason being no one knows if the death was due to or with Covid-19 My friends dad works for insurance and told me the corrupt system that was going on If paramedics and doctors suspected any Covid-19 related symptoms from their patients or victims in any deathly cause; marking up that the death was Covid related would instantly give them a Covid relief bonus So with that being said nothing is accurate in this country,flashundredyardash,16456749960,1
hy7mhfa,szo1gx,Too bad our healthcare workers wouldnt prescribe early treatments Some independent doctors say that 85% could have been saved with early treatment,Free_58,16456863800,1
i11kxn0,szo1gx,> As Luppe B Luppen noted on Twitter the newspapers more recent headline was the cruel and callous "900000 Dead but Many Americans Move On" This headline succinctly captures the feelings towards COVID in America No one cares anymore From the frontline worker to the Biden administration,HellaReyna,16475381880,0
