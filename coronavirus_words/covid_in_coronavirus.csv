All because they wanted to go on a trip? I make just enough to get all my bills paid i cant afford that There is no going back to normalcy Shit has hit the fan for us in the united states We need to stop being so selfish and deal with the issues that covid has amplified and uncovered in our country and take responsibility so we can grow to become a stronger more unified nation,foolishsunshine,16278309680,134

Theyve still got polio in Africa I guarantee even if we wipe COVID off the map in the West youll still have variants coming from the 3rd world This is a bad argument Stop blaming non-vaccinated people for lockdowns and masks The government is whats slowing us down,Doge_Of_Wall_Street,16278654610,3

h7bun41,ovpxdj,My problem is this: Had the first shot waiting for appt for the second one But now I am reading that people who have been vaccinated are contracting COVID Im all in favor of vaccines - but - if you can still get the disease that you are vaccinated against that doesnt mean you are bullet-proof once you are vaccinated I guess its all a matter of percentages and avoiding getting really sick if you get the virus after vaccination Heres the other weird thing: Ive been reading about people whove had COVID who are not immune to getting it again From what I read the antibodies do not last that long - like only a few months or at least they dont show up on tests How is the vaccine any different?

h7bv5k3,ovpxdj,Worst part is that all these new variants are coming from the bodies of unvaccinated people who go into critical care Allowing them to live on a ventilator just gives the virus a perfect environment to mutate endlessly I listened to a [podcast](https://wwwwnycstudiosorg/podcasts/radiolab/articles/dispatch-14-covid-crystal-ball) where a man in the UK who was sick with covid for weeks was given the vaccine The problem was he already had like 10 different mutations of covid that were created in his body while he was sick When they gave him the vaccine the other mutations quickly took over and killed him Whats really crazy is they sequenced the strains in his body and found he had independently created the same variants found in other parts of the world before they became wide spread The fact we have the same strains mutating independently in different people in different parts of the world scares the shit out of me Just fuck these selfish awful people who wont get vaccinated and stop this pandemic,somecallmemike,16278358080,1

h7cho06,ovpxdj,According to the research being done especially in places like Israel that has a population over 60 at 80% vaccinated by February data is showing the vaccine effectiveness is fading quick and dramatically Had you been vaccinated in January such as myself youll find youre at best walking around with an effectiveness of nearly 20% compared to someone vaccinated in June who is around 80% If unvaccinated people are the only ones getting sick the concern we are seeing wouldnt be there You would be protected with your vaccination and would have little to worry about The truth is we will see more variants and until we have boosters available and ones that can be made quickly before the new variants take hold we will continue to see spikes regardless of previous vaccinations Instead we are seeing vaccinated people spreading the virus and some knowingly I know first hand someone who is currently infected after being vaccinated in april and she continues to work at her job since the symptoms arent bad according to her and she is vaccinated The anti vaxxers are a problem but theyre a distraction from the real issue that your vaccine will only provide so much protection and its not a ticket to do whatever you want If the vaccine worked effectively for the current delta variant they would only be their own problem Kind of like driving a car with a seatbelt The direct impact is only to the individual I have and still continue to wear two masks including an n95 as well as limit my public interactions It isnt hard to wear a mask its not hard to use common sense even if youre vaccinated Weve had a hospital in my metropolitan area that had 20% of the admitted covid patients fully vaccinated It all depends on when your state started doing vaccines and how long ago it had been since you got yours And we will see a lot more of these so called "breakthrough" cases regardless of vaccination rates And government officials have been warned already of this and the CDC has discussed this internally and a lot of people are concerned about the effectiveness of the vaccines The mask mandate should have never been removed and local governments have also failed their constituents,mrnight8,16278464230,1

My slight chance of dying has no effect on you Why cant we go back to normal why do you insist on wanting everyone to be vaccinated if you are safe? Are you going to ban fast food? High fructose? High sugar? Opioids? Over eating? Those are killers as well and at a much larger scale Why dont you care if Im morbidly obese and at risk of death but care if I can get infected from Covid? I know that the obvious answer will be "you can create a new variant" but think about it The variants we have now have been from all over the world Meaning that unless 100% of the world population is vaccinated with a vaccine that is effective 100% variants will always be a thing So again if you are vaccinated and I choose to be unvaccinated what is stopping us from going back to normal?,trolololoz,16278309140,-4

gybc0zt,ndkvik,Totally anecdotal and I realize my area might not represent the average American area since we have for the most part been taking covid seriously since the beginning but my state did announce they were changing their mask mandate to reflect the CDC guidelines so we are on the honor system now I was at the mall yesterday and it was pretty busy but literally everyone was wearing a mask still I was honestly shocked since we have good vaccine uptake and over half our adult population fully vaccinated I was expecting to see at least a few The only ones I saw were people sitting at tables and actively eating/drinking and a couple under the nose/chin but its basically no change from before the announcement I just got my 2nd shot so Im not technically fully vaxed yet but I was personally planning to still wear a mask in crowded indoor places like the mall grocery store etc for now until numbers are very low because it just doesnt bother me and its that extra bit of protection Was just surprised to see apparently everyone else feels the same way!,skatinvee,16211648790,578
gybqebq,ndkvik,Of course theyll lie the CDC knows that Everyone knows that Not all of us were born yesterday It sucks for those that are incapable of vaccinating but I dont know how else the CDC is supposed to proceed under the assumption that the vaccines are as effective as they are They cant force people to get shots the anti-maskers will continue to refuse shots those that cant get shots but otherwise want them cant get vaccinated and most people that want the shot are getting it They also cant expect masks to work forever just because more people get sick of them by the day Eventually people will just accept the risk like many had already been doing Really there is no way forward for the CDC with the pre-existing guidance which is why the guidance changed The belief that everyone should get vaccinated comes from the desire to eradicate COVID; that ship has sailed as early as last June and we still expect the cows to come back to the barn The cows are gone: COVID is here to stay The CDC finally threw its hands up and said "ok you want to deal with Covid? Fuck it have all the Covid you want If you want to live you know where the vaccine is" Frankly I cant blame them and would probably do the same myself I feel bad for those that cant get the Covid shot for allergies or whatever else but I dont feel bad at all if someone gets sick because they refuse to get the vaccine Now its like any other anti-vaxxor talking point,AyyyGreens,16211740740,119

gybl5f9,ndkvik,Some of my coworkers do I have some who arent vaccinated dont plan on it and brag about taking advantage of the change It just angers me because most of them are selfish Even saying its just a flu The flu didnt kill my family Covid-19 did Edit: To clarify now that Im off work I have multiple family members who died to Covid but not my entire family,RattusDraconis,16211711080,327
gyc0oid,ndkvik,My own personal question is do I care? Every one of my family members and friends I care about is vaccinated Almost 50% of the country has at least one dose 10% of the country has documented cases of Covid and its likely higher/around 15-20% We are genuinely almost at herd immunity in the US Im at a point where I just dont know how to care about other people anymore when they obviously dont care about me,hapianman,16211792140,123
gybiekq,ndkvik,As a vaccine clinical trial subject masker and "covid is real" person I would say this 1 Those people are going to lie 2 This policy will incentivizes some people 3 There will be some that wont vaccinate or cant vaccinate That will not change with time The only question was when was dropping mask a good point in terms of balancing it out with number of covid cases out there and early enough to incentivize the potential hold outs to impact vaccine numbers (incentive diminishes and covid numbers approaches zero),questionname,16211694170,29

gyclayg,ndkvik,My take on the new guidelines is this: If youve been vaccinated - and on this sub Im assuming all have - then forget about the anti-vax people Theyre risking their own health not yours You can interact with them and not risk getting covid after fully vaccinating If they choose to not vax - then fuck em Their loss Now that a significant portion of the population is at least partially vaccinated - that group is not at risk and the anti-vax people are not your concern - so why punish yourselves for their stupidity If the anti-vax folk want to pretend theyve been vaccinated - fuck em If they get sick its on them not us,lunch0000,16211885460,2

gybo0ws,ndkvik,IMO people should continue to use masks even when vaccinated because people can still get covid even when vaccinated Sure you wont get hospital but the more people without masks more it will multiply risking a new variant appear that can just ignore immunity Just search for what happened in the city of Manaus in Brazil (tldr over 70% of the city got infected with the first variant authorities thought they were safe since the majority should have antibodies P1 variant appeared and could infect even people that already caught Covid then demand for O2 skyrocketed and people died) edit: gotta love the downvotes LOL So some data for the people "buhu i dont wanna keep using a mask" [https://www1folhauolcombr/equilibrioesaude/2021/05/dois-asilos-no-rio-grande-do-sul-registram-surto-de-covid-mesmo-apos-vacinacaoshtml](https://www1folhauolcombr/equilibrioesaude/2021/05/dois-asilos-no-rio-grande-do-sul-registram-surto-de-covid-mesmo-apos-vacinacaoshtml) Basically two nursing homes in Brazil where everybody were fully vaccinated had covid outbreaks with the following results: Lar do Idoso So Vicente de Paula in So Luiz Gonzaga (RS) day 29 de abril de 2021: 79 supected cases 64 confirmed by testing (48 erderly and 16 workers 81% infection) They were vaccinated January 21 and feburary 18 10 had to be hospitalized (not in the ICU 156%) 2 died (one 77 year old man and one 80 year old woman both had debilitated health) So Vicente de Paula em So Borja (RS) (both nursing homes have similar names) Everyone vaccinated in january 20 and feb 18 first cases appeared in 23 april: 68 suspected cases 56 positive (47 elderly and 9 workers 82% infection) 10 people need hospitalized (2 in the ICU) 2 deaths (90 years old woman and a 78 year old man),7orly7,16211727550,-13

gyc699o,ndkvik,The new rules are based on the fact of how effective the vaccines are An assumption that if you are fully vaxxed and sit next to a person with active Covid there is not risk there For herd immunity it matters how many people get it If you individually are vaccinated you can feel confidant to go live your life and not worry about Covid thats how amazing the Pfizer and moderna vaccines are Yes there are very rare cases of MILD Covid post vaccination but it needs to be talked about more how ridiculously good these vaccines are Less than one in a million die of Covid post vaccine,ben14034,16211818550,1
gyc6glz,ndkvik,We know that people will lie and we know that covid skeptics who dont wear a mask will probably not shy from gathering together outside of mask-requried places like grocery stores and spread it amongst themselves anyway Everyone should get this vaccine asap and now it is so ubiquitous you can just walk into a pharmacy in most places the mad scramble is over There isnt really an excuse At this point if you have a vaccine an unmasked anti-vaxxer is probably not going to give you covid in any form and close to 0% chance they give you a symptomatic case with or without you wearing a mask So do those of us that are fully vaccinated need to wear a mask that really doesnt protect us much to protect those that are too conspiratorial conservative or lazy to walk into a Walgreens and get a shot?,greatnowimannoyed,16211819490,1

If youre concerned about Covid get the vaccine then it doesnt matter if other people are If youre unable to get vaccinated thats unfortunate and you have to mitigate that risk as best you can but its not the rest of the worlds responsibility to mask forevermore We dont ask if people are vaccinated for ***anything*** else (any number of diseases more deadly than COVID) except to registering for school and travel There should absolutely be no circumstance in which you should have to show that you have a COVID vaccine without having to show all others (eg when youre sharing your vaccination record in circumstances where its *already* required),thekeldog,16211857120,1

gyclw1u,ndkvik,Fortunately nearly every person willing and without contraindication has already had their chance (for MONTHS) to get vaccinated for free Furthermore I feel like a return to normalcy would result in more hospitalizations for car wrecks and other activity-related traumas than actual severe COVID cases so wouldnt worry so much about hospitals being overrun again Although its certainly still *possible* (albeit far less likely) to get severe COVID despite vaccination almost all who do get it are most likely either anti-vax or more tragically contraindicated for the vaccines If youre an anti-vax type who ends up hospitalized with severe COVID you shouldnt and *probably* wont receive a lower standard of care but dont be surprised if theres a lack of empathy among healthcare staff We really reallllly appreciate everyone who is getting vaccinated Its been a tough year,dangerface,16211888090,1

Dont worry about it; you can have as much Covid as you want You already know where the vaccine is if you want to live" I cant say I blame them; Id probably do the same I feel bad for those that cant get the Covid shot for allergies or whatever else but I dont feel bad at all if someone gets sick because they refuse to get the vaccine Its now just like every other anti-vaccination talking point,Hot_Firefighter,16211888960,1

gulj5da,mrcrm8,Im very pro-vaccines and I think this vaccine should be used but I dont get this argument People arent choosing between injecting themselves with the vaccine and injecting themselves with COVID Its not an apples to apples comparison; you have to factor in both the risk of COVID causing a blood clot *and* the risk of getting COVID in the first place In this case the risk of catching COVID would have to be more than 1/8; from what I can tell the total infection rate in the USA is only about 1/10 and for someone whos taking precautions like masking and distancing its almost certainly even less Just accept that theres a slightly elevated risk of blood clots with the vaccine but in most peoples cases the *overall* benefits (both to personal health and to reaching herd immunity so that life can go back to normal) outweigh the risk and anyone whos worried should have a conversation with their own doctor about their personal risk level,etgohomeok,16184900830,4857

Would you still take AZ right away? Depending on your age and risk of infection it *might* actually be better if you didt The question of using AZ is not a non-question or hysteria as some here claim it to be Its a matter of risk assessment In most circumstances the asseseemnt will recommned taking AZ But not in all,bond0815,16184903300,254

guneasa,mrcrm8,This is misleading because if you take the shot then its a probability of getting a clot With Covid out in the wild and you out in the wild that 8 times probability becomes infinite If you get a shot or two then you stop getting shots If you get Covid once you can get it again and again so it never stops Plus again the risk of you getting it depends on how normal you go back to,imgprojts,16185203070,1

gunjngl,mrcrm8,What really fucking annoys me in many of the answers here is *only* comparing blood clot (or rather CVT / "brain clots") risk between Covid and AZ/vaccines Instead of mortality / side effects / long term effects (off both) in general Yes AZ might have a higher risk of CVTs than Pfizer/Biontech and yes it might "only be n times less than the risk of those from Covid"  but Covid can cause death / hospitalization / long term lung or neural damage / "Long Covid" / watever IN ADDITION to blood clots / CVTs And yep even in "the young and healthy" (although with lower probability than in the elderly / other groups at risk  but still quite a bit) Sounds really fucking short-sighted thinking to me Yeah it might be best if everyone would get "the good vaccine" but not everyone can (ask Europe or even better ask "poorer countries) and in really the very most cases even "the bad one" sooner is still much better than getting Covid and dying from blood clots or any of the other many ways it can kill you  or suffering from any of the long term effects On top of that: Getting yourself vaccinated sooner does not only protect your individual sorry corpse it also protects others by reducing potential for further spread (and mutations) and of course protecting those who cannot get vaccinated or whose immune system cannot build as effective an immune response with the vaccine ("vaccine non responders" is the term iirc) What Im saying is: no its not just "AZ clots vs Covid clots vs Biontech clots",spurious_signal,16185227240,1
gunkmer,mrcrm8,I have a blood clotting disorder with history of pulmonary embolism and I also have low platelet count aka thrombocytopenia I am not on anticoagulation (blood thinning medication) My doctors say its perfectly safe for me and that the benefits of the shot outweigh any potential side effects That getting covid would be more dangerous for me I rarely if ever leave the house as Im disabled and work from home I wear my mask and wash my hands religiously Im pro vaccine and science but with my medical conditions I am feeling afraid of the vaccine I feel like I should just stay in my house and never leave than get the vaccine My hematologist said if I am concerned I could take baby aspirin for two weeks following vaccination in order to prevent clots but this doesnt seem sufficient in my opinion Thoughts?,Algae-Downtown,16185231710,1

guotxn9,mrcrm8,There was a good article somewhere about how to assess these risks at a more personal level Like the chances of bad outcomes from these things varies with stuff like age and certain pre-existing conditions along with the general community transmission rates of covid So for this headline here you would need to compare also "what are my chances of getting covid *at all*?" against the choice of vaccine If the chances of getting covid are very very low (maybe you live on an island off NZ or something) then it might make sense to avoid AstraZeneca since in your circumstances your chances of having *any* negative outcome from covid are very very very low compared with a very very low chance of negative outcome from AstraZeneca At the public health level different countries have already taken different reactions based on their particular circumstances For instance if you have a fairly dense population and are high income country and have access to something like the BioNTech vaccine then you might take the approach of abandoning AstraZeneca entirely If you are at the other extreme low income poorly developed health infrastructure lots of people long travel times from population centres you probably will press ahead with AstraZeneca and similar vaccines because of its advantages and accept that you will have some small number of complications or deaths because it is far smaller number of deaths from the much slower more expensive difficult roll out of different vaccines,FartHeadTony,16185472640,1

hcbmg0z,pl59ch,Its unfortunate sad almost pathetic that it takes a mandate to get the rest of our country vaccinated In the beginning of the vaccine roll out people were line jumping etc to get that shot; as it rolled out and the oppositional became more vocal we had to incentivize it with millionaire contests and outright paying people to get the vaccine Its pathetic that this idiot pandemic has gone on so longthe reason it is still with us is that not everyone is getting vaccinated so the virus is continuing to spread and its mutating Do we want to still be dealing with this virus next year also???? Im really sick of it Especially the disappointment that my family and I got our two doses of Pfizer shot and because of everything else we cant feel 100% safe from Covid Weve done our part and gotten vaccinatedcan barely wait to get a third doseand still read that vaccinated people die from this stupid virus! Regardless of your personal feelings its a public health crisisthere are way too many news articles about dying unvaccinated people saying they wish theyd gotten vaccinated Even if you think its stupid get it and be a hero for the greater good I think another worry is Bidens mental stateas in is he mentally competent?

hc8f8x0,pl59ch,Pros: More vaccinated = fewer hospitals overloaded Cons: more people quitting jobs to avoid the vaccine While the increased vaccination rate should slow the spread and decrease the number of hospitalizations thereby decreasing the unsustainable load on our failing healthcare system this move may also trigger a wave of resignations from the workforce at a time when labor is already in short supply Diregarding for a moment the arguments around freedom of choice and the role of government in our lives the question is: will this mandate have a net positive effect on our society? Does the anticipated decrease in hospitalizations outweigh the potential decrease in the labor force? Consider also the compounding effects of a labor shortage ( yes I know its actually a wage shortage) on the already fractured supply chain Additionally how much benefit will we actually see from this mandate if (when) a vaccine resistant variant of covid begins to dominate?

hc92k83,pl59ch,This doesnt solve anything it only promotes more propaganda Even if youre fully vaccinated and do all of the right things you can certainly get infected and be transmissible Its definitely not just the unvaccinated who are spreading this And while were at this the single biggest vax demographic thats reluctant to get the jabs are the African American community (just around 40% have been vaxxed White 50% Asiatic 67%) So he basically just told them all that he was going to take their jobs if they dont submit to the orders of an old white man surrounded by whites and if they dont comply theyll even lose their healthcare Meanwhile they are adding thousands of people into the mix from Afghanistan and lets not forget the practically open southern border where MANY of those caught crossing are testing positive for covid This administration is fuckawful I can tell you something With him creating even more of a divisive stance in this country it will only lead to further division Certainly no one who has been anti vax or even vaccine hesitant is going to listen to this "message" and think you know now Im gonna forget my previous stance and get the jab In fact given recent global events and the lies that have been perpetuated of day that trust in our government locally or globally is at an all time low I predict this will be challenged very quickly with the courts,Posthumos1,16312344230,16

hpmkad4,rm4ymn,TIL that care standards vary greatly There are massive discrepancies in standard hospitalization procedures across states and likely internationally It seems that people dont know what they should be asking because COVID isnt respiratory Its a vascular disease caused by antibodies overreacting and attacking a protein in your blood causing clots The virus enters through lung cells so the clots start there At least up until omicron Standard care should almost immediately involve some level of heparin to start and remdesivir In most cases this is enough Worse cases may require dexamethasone to calm the immune system Oxygen should usually be used Most hospitalized should be out of the hospital quickly Monoclonal antibodies worked very well on Delta too But what you dont here is that you shouldnt wait If you have a fever for more than 2 days after testing positive and your chest gets tight look for a monoclonal site If the monitors tell you to go the hospital then you go Keep the hospitals clear dont take medical hooey and understand that time is of the essence,Walternotwalter,16402200280,2

At least with many treatments you can sue for undocumented side effects And secondly I dont really need it I have minimal exposure to people outside I already suffered through covid and have immunity and covid wasnt lethal for me Do I carry it? Probably not no As far as I can tell my immune system removes it within around 24 hours of me getting it I can usually tell by being extremely tired and having heat in my nose as some of the onset covid symptoms Anyways its sad to see people prioritize herd immunity over vaccinating the individuals that need it Immunocompromised individuals are another conversation but they are an extreme minority,obliviron,16223079530,0

h9x4cxf,p9dd93,Good Ive been saying for long before Covid that going into the office for most jobs is stupid especially when youre expected to dress up for roles that arent client-facing I work harder at home than I ever did at the office Its almost like being in comfortable clothes with less interruptions and more chances for short breaks (including healthier ones like nature walks and cat naps) makes for a healthier work environment and only encourages creativity and growth,tinycourageous,16296466940,31

h9x38c3,p9dd93,Ive been managing a remote engineering team for about 15 years- long long before Covid After managing onsite teams for about 15 before that It is IMHO night and day more difficult to manage the remote team And IMHO most of the issues solved by remote work are actually issues with horrible open offices and long commutes- not anything specifically to do with remote vs onsite work Some thoughts from doing this for over a decade: * 25% of people will be productive no matter where they are 25% will be problematic no matter where they are 50% of people work better with some form of office infrastructure Everyone thinks they are in that first 25% * Dealing with HR issues is much much more problematic with remote employees Try dealing with terming someone with a substance abuse problem when you never get to see them in person and dont have an attendance record to support your HR case * Peoples home environments are often horribly full of distractions People put up with this during Covid because there were no other alternatives- but having someones toddler running around screaming during meetings is an issue A good WFH environment will have a dedicated home office and a good WFH employee will have uninterrupted time in that office- but most dont have their home workspaces set up properly * Peoples WFH performance deteriorates over time- especially over many years Especially with employees with kids who only one parent is WFH Suddenly you realize that you are working around an employee who has to pick up the kids from school every day during work hours- folks start building lives/schedules around being able to disappear for a couple hours a day * There are simply no good current tech substitutes for a classic conference room whiteboard session Doing this remotely sucks All of that can be managed with appropriate focus/tools/etc But it adds substantially to the managerial effort required I think it seemed to work during Covid better than it would have because many tech firms paused or slowed down their project work during that period (I know all of my clients basically shelved most of the project deliverables last/this year and we are just now getting back to regular project planning cycles) Well see maybe Ill be wrong and the tech has progressed to the point where this will work I think the norm is going to become hybrid plans where folks are in the office a couple days a week but cant fully live anywhere they want,jakdak,16296461930,43

h9yopvs,p9dd93,I disagree - a little The tide has turned already with companies using double vaccination as their way to get people back into the office - at least for now In short "*if youre double-vaxxed youre as safe as youre ever going to be so for you people there is no longer an excuse to not return to the office*" Those who refuse to get vaxxed and/or return to the office will just have to find new employment Whether this holds will be a company-by-company deal A company which has an exodus of employees may well have to reconsider And of course being double-vaxxed is no guarantee of not catching Covid and falling ill A boss who loses double-vaxxed employees to Covid after implementing a back-to-the-office rule may find themselves in hot water The longer remote work remains the more it becomes the norm and a return to the old ways unlikely However the success - or not - of vaccinations and whether new Delta-like variants emerge (not to mention brand new novel viruses) will be the ultimate guide We are a very long way from knowing what the end state will be,TheFirstMinister,16296713520,2

h9yraaj,p9dd93,Remote work may be working fine now but the danger comes when companies start to turn over completely and reaches the point where almost everyone working there was hired during or after the covid work from home experiment Innovation at that point will start to diminish as working relationships arent as strong as the first cohort of employees who knew each other prior to working from home One of the most insightful quotes I read about WFH is "When you lose connections you stop innovating Its harder for new ideas to get in and groupthink becomes a serious possibility",bloatedkat,16296725750,2
h9ysw34,p9dd93,Ah the unintended upside of COVID It forced the world to try WFH insomuch as jobs supported it For many this means living where they want instead of where the company happens to be usually in some expensive metro area where homeownership is out of reach especially for younger employees early in their career track I sold my LA County townhome made a healthy profit in a sellers market and upgraded to my first-ever single family home with lots of room a 3-car garage solar etc all for about what I was paying in LA Plus Im much happier without a grueling commute every single day no matter how bad I feel in the morning With the old system if you felt sick you might call out and feel better later in the day At home you can just start later or more slowly and ease into work Way less missed days way more productivity and no precious time lost to commuting Commuting doesnt just eat up time it adds stress adds wear and tear to vehicles and consumes precious energy we could normally use for work tasks Thats assume we even make it to where were going without tickets accidents etc And believe me Ive had a few accidents on the way to work all the fault of someone else or interactions with road-debris Sometimes the traffic is so bad that a 1 hour commute is 5 hours Yes there was one night where it took my girlfriend 5 Hours To Get Home Needless to say she called in sick the next day And because employees often lack imagination and make everyone come in around the same time traffic and misery is maximized No such issue with WFH No wonder the real-estate market has been going crazy everywhere even if a lot of agents dont really get whats happening,Wolkenflieger,16296733390,2
h9yuk6n,p9dd93,The old normal is a thing of the past It would be shocking if we had covid under control globally in less than 5-10 years Its worse this year than it was last year the only difference is that we are more confortable with the idea of covid and its boubdaries By the time the old normal is possible again none of us will recognize it as being the same- we all must accept that life business work etc has irrevocably changed and it wont just magically be the same next summer only because a calendar year has passed,Alan_R_Rigby,16296741440,2
h9zjtur,p9dd93,I have lifelong friendships and business references from working with people in an office It sounds great maybe if you are young and still in touch with school/university people for your social life Even having offices move to WFH seems great because all your coworkers are in the same area and you already have closer bonds from knowing them in-person so even over video it seems a bit more fun Well over time workers will come and go and fewer and fewer new hires will be "local" to you Though you will have social "zoom meetings" it just wont have the same impact For the past 6 years Ive worked either remotely or with a large part of the team being remote so COVID wasnt the start of this for me As Ive noticed almost nobody keeps in touch after changing jobs from these remote teams Apart from perhaps a reference for a job application there is little to zero contact No long term friendships no long term anything Sure sometimes when someone would move to a new job you might chat quite a bit talk about things but usually those fizzle to zero rather quickly However I have plenty of friends held for decades gained from working together in person We still go out to hang talk over voice and chat play online and in-person games grab some drinks or see a show Those remote people on the "Chicago Team" of a job from five years ago I struggle to remember their names now Long term this will probably damage cities and urban centers Think the rise of the automobile and massive efficient highways created suburban sprawl? Hold your beer for the new WFH economy The continent will likely become coast to coast suburbs with neighbors with tall fences who hardly know each other Its okay you can watch movies in your home You can watch sports in your home You can see concerts in your home You can have your groceries delivered Fine dining some driving service will bring you food from that local restaurant if it really exists Perhaps Taco Bell now? Welcome to your home your prison I cant wait for the downvotes here I can almost smell them Of course some of what I am saying might not completely come to be but without a doubt its a strong possibility I guarantee this first taste of 100% remote working seems great now but long term the unintended consequences have not been fully considered And by the time those consequences are more strongly realized it would probably be impossible to go back to the office or at least a long uphill battle,RedditRage,16296866320,2

hceayd0,p9dd93,I am one of the people who never want to go back into the office after working about 20 years in corporate America I have embraced working from home since Covid started I love that I have down time in between meetings I can concentrate of work without disruptions grab some food and eat go sit on the deck for 15 minutes and get some sunshine and think I am a better employee and more productive I was having a conversation today with a co-worker and he thinks that things will be back to "normal" in corporate America in 3 years saying that he believes we will all be working back in the office again I said no way if a job can be done remote I believe a hybrid work environment will be embraced in a post-covid world and it will be more widely accepted to be working from home 3 years from now I am curious what others think Will corporate America have all of us working back in the office in 3 years?

h9yy9je,p9dd93,I like working from home and I definitely hope itll continue to be a normal part of work during and "after" Covid-19 However I think people are generally a bit to quick to sing its praises The advantages for those that have work thats suited for it have established relationships with colleagues and dont struggle with work-related psychological challenges are obvious But for some it makes their work a lot harder without extra pay For some its really hard to get to know their colleagues in a new workplace and become a real part of a team And for some they now suffer in isolation and invisibly slip into deeper problems with nobody around to ask "are you OK?" Thats not to say we should move back into the offices like nothing changed - but businesses should be pushed into dealing with these problems before they become big problems The companies youll want to work for are the companies that get working from home right,grismar-net,16296759310,1

ha04grb,p9dd93,This is something I suggested to my company in the UK: Hi folks Ive given some consideration to this and would like to suggest the below rules to satisfy a flexible work offering to the SD: I have based this on: 23 SD staff (8x 24/7 engineers 15x Core shift) Image Image Image Each engineer must come in 40% of their time Each day there must be at least 5 people physically on rotad shift Each day there must be no more than 10 engineer on schedule We split the WFH days in any given week between a choice of Monday+Tuesday or Thursday+Friday This grants opportunity of "extended weekend feeling" to all Q: Why 40% submission to physical occupation? A: TeamLead stated Service Desk requires an obligatory 15% physical office presence on any working day Q: How does this impact skill availability? A: It doesnt this is based purely on resource as we have availability across core teams in the working week On average we will have 8 engineers physically within the office space Q: How this is managed? A: Either by a scheduling app/portal where engineers self-sign up (first come first serve) and commit to fulfilling their weekly hours or assigned by TLs Q: How does this solution address 24/7 flexibility? A: Whilst 24/7 day shift must attend the office space 24/7 night shift fulfil duties from home Any 24/7 day shift falling on a weekend is fulfilled from home This is open to your adjustments or leave as is in the pot for discussion and practical application for the business Thanks" Glad to say this has now been adopted  Before COVID happened my company was on target to turn 200m so they purchased a new HQ for 15m We are an IT Managed Service Provider The company had plans to go global looking for offices in the USA They signed the contract grace period passed and then COVID happened They were unable to back out of the deal and have since been working within regulations of UK lockdowns and government guidance to continue with the new head office plan We have lost only 1 employee during this pandemic and that was after he contracted Covid after major surgery Work load has increased the employment demand at our company due to demand from clients working remotely and other IT projects Due to Covid theyve put the expansion on the back burner for now and are cautiously monitoring markets and of course Covid itself They still want to expand to the US Fingers crossed!  As we have hospitals and government clients for technical support we were actually classed as support workers and got full 80% furlough offered but we didnt need to take it Covid has just sped up the work from home culture and those that do not change their ways are set to lose good employees Mental health has been cited as one of the major drivers with a large majority of workers being effected I personally have been wfh social distancing and wearing a mask in public since 2019 when my wife started chemotherapy after a mastectomy So this has been the norm for us long before Covid came along I do think there is a need for a physical space a lot of clients say the office is a place to separate home and work life Ive never had this as an issue in fact I am blessed that I have seen my son grow up since his birth in 2019 I get to spend time playing with him look after my wife and be home "on time" or work late if I want to An hour here and there longer doesnt kill me in fact I believe I start earlier and finish on time or happy to work later I think sales people need that physical connection and banter with their colleagues its the nature of that beast I know from a lot of clients and other companies I interviewed for that WFH was a massive positive to performance and output but over time people have got complacent or lazy and now efficiency is actually on the back slide WFH is definitely here to stay to what degree and capacity offered is another thing Ps feel free to use my wfh flexible working plan ,PrimarisBA,16296996010,1

hb1o56y,pf4633,Moderna Incs Covid vaccine generated more than double the antibodies of a similar shot made by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE in research directly comparing immune responses to the inoculations A study of almost 2500 workers at a major Belgium hospital system found antibody levels among individuals who hadnt been infected with the coronavirus before getting two doses of the Moderna vaccine averaged 2881 units per milliliter compared with 1108 units/mL in an equivalent group who got two jabs of the Pfizer shot The results published Monday in a letter to the Journal of the American Medical Association suggested the differences might be explained by the: higher amount of active ingredient in the Moderna vaccine -- 100 micrograms versus 30 micrograms in Pfizer-BioNTech longer interval between doses of the Moderna vaccine -- four weeks versus three weeks for Pfizer-BioNTech Modernas vaccine was associated with a two-fold risk reduction against breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to Pfizers in a review of people in the Mayo Clinic Health System in the US from January to July The results were reported in a separate study released ahead of publication and peer review on Aug 9,actualtext,16304105170,2894

Moderna doesnt get as much press as Pfizer but they should I got Moderna at my local supermarket chain here in Florida like everyone around here did Ive been vaccinated since March Ive been near people who had covid and Ive known a few people who had it but I never got covid nor anyone I knew who had the Moderna jab Ive been on flights and some crowded restaurants Never got covid Good job Moderna!

hb2rtz6,pf4633,Discussion This study demonstrated a significantly higher humoral immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) compared with the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) in infected as well as uninfected participants and across age categories The higher mRNA content in mRNA-1273 compared with BNT162b2 and the longer interval between priming and boosting for mRNA-12733 (4 weeks vs 3 weeks for BNT162b2) might explain this difference A relationship between neutralization level after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and protection against COVID-19 has been demonstrated by several studies4 As such the height of the humoral response after vaccination which correlates with neutralizing antibody titers5 might be clinically relevant Limitations of this study include the lack of data on cellular immunity and on neutralizing antibodies as well as the specific focus on health care workers Whether the observed difference in antibody level translates to a difference in the duration of protection4 the protection against variants of concern and the risk of transmission6 needs further investigation Future research should also address the relevance for patients with reduced antibody response after vaccination,MastadonInfantry,16304283470,1

hmsmq4x,r6ejmd,Regardless anyones best bet is to probably take the booster and check out again for another 6 months while obviously practicing common sense around others I take back what I said a few days ago about Omicron potentially being the big one for all but it will probably just be the case for those fully unvaccinated and who have trusted in their bodys natural immunity since March 2020 EDIT: 6 months off Covid news I mean It feels as if were reaching the point where its just a game of keeping up with whatever is the most effective vaccine every 6 months or so unless something comes around and messes things up 6 months of course would be nice but its definitely a dream Just simple Covid news not time off lol,Sn1pe,16383664860,-9

hmtmnrx,r6ejmd,Lmao they know little to nothing about the OG covid 19 virus throw in mutations and it is a constant cycle of trying to catch up Alot of knowledge is coming from past experiences with coronaviruses but thats a very basic understanding that doesnt account for adaptations/mutation If they had an actual knowledge of what truly works with preventing or atleast decreasing symptoms we wouldnt be on shot #4 in a years time And before everyone says Im against vaccinations Im not However I will always be skeptical about any type of meds that are authorized for emergency use Time and results over the longterm will determine true effectiveness (And not saying we will but could just as easily find out that THIS vaccination COULD be doing more harm than good to our bodies) Tiny tidbit: my mother tested positive for Covid now 4-5 times hospitalized 3 of those times all in the past year (She has had all shots and boosters) kind of leads me to believe in a lack of effectiveness or I suppose false diagnosis (She is not only one I know just the closest to me that has tested positive and been hospitalized multiple times,Puzzleheaded-Yard891,16383815520,1

Vaccines are working So honestly the death data leads me to believe there are waaaaay less people in the ICU vs last year Not sure Im buying these drama headlines or why the hospitals are struggling this year vs last And Mass general on their own website stated they have ICU capacity as of 12/24 https://datargjcom/covid-19-hospital-capacity/facility/massachusetts-general-hospital/220071/ Now Im sure the holiday surge probably pushed those numbers up but look at last year the same time frame They had 157 ICU beds last Christmas They now have 147 Theyve lost 9% of their beds (probably due to staff having Covid) But that isnt exactly a crisis and they still appear to have capacity But just saying do the research for yourself and come to your own conclusions Then again its Reddit and no one gives a $&@% A sensationalistic headline gets way more clicks even if the article is offering alternative facts and people have an attention span of an ant So who cares right? Im gonna save this mass general link so I can check the data for next week Not reaching a conclusion yet but based on this data Im leaning towards "yes this is a problem but its not the end of the world crisis the internet makes you believe" EDIT: and honestly the EMT post below was asking who to blame? Look at the Mass General link and how much capacity they had last Nov they over shot offering 210+ beds Operating at half capacity is not profitable for the hospital so it makes sense they would scale down and run at capacity If youre looking for someone to blame clearly this is hospital managements problem Theyve underestimated the demand for ICU beds and werent able to scale up fast enough Granted this is an extremely difficult thing to predict Who knew right?

Youre right you probably wont get sick after vaccinated Youre right youll probably be fine if you do catch COVID-19 after vaccinated Or you wont be This virus is going to keep evolving and changing Id rather not be the person who becomes patient zero for a new strain The opportunity cost for NOT wearing a mask is way too big for me to ignore I will wear a mask and continue to not have to smile around strangers,BlazingCondor,16274840500,-6
h6upe2u,ot7vtq,I mean I kinda dont care I was on board with masks and lockdown when that was the best solution not only for myself but everyone But now Im supposed to wear a mask to protect unvaccinated people? There are only two types of people who are unvaccinated; those who cant and those who wont Those who cant have other medical issues that they need to manage and have always needed to manage and most if not all of them are at risk of dying or serious medical issues from the common cold and Im not going to wear a mask to protect them from the common cold just like before And I cant really care about people who wont get vaccinated Their choice their risk Why should I let their acceptance of that risk cause me to cater to them and protect them? If Im carrying covid while vaccinated Im going to be fine If someone comes into contact with me whos vaccinated theyre going to be fine The only other argument I can possibly see is reducing mutation chance but by that logic we should never stop wearing masks to reduce mutation chance in all other diseases too Unless vaccinations are no longer effective I dont care I protected myself if you choose not to and put yourself in risky situations that patently is not my problem You cant fix stupid,SaucyMacgyver,16274926310,1

h8nk4iu,p2wk4m,Mississippian here to help put this in context: Our governor who is a die hard Trump follower has pulled back from making any mask mandates He wants people to make their own "individual choices" About two weeks ago the leading university Mississippi State University reissued a mask mandate for all classrooms and buildings Then every university followed (Ole Miss Southern etc) Usually the public schools will follow the universities but this point many public schools had already started classes Boom we started seeing outbreaks and the schools couldnt hide it COVID testing is very easy to obtain so parents with sick children started getting tested and contacting the schools Now schools have to alert all of their parents that "Weve had cases" On top of that the MHSAA (state public school athletic commission) decided to step in and announced yesterday that if "Any school goes virtual they can not play fall sports" So this will force many schools to stay face to face just to play football Meanwhile the hospitals are slammed out the ass We have ZERO ICU beds How bad is it? Tupelo Hospital (the largest rural hospital in the state) is using their Emergency Room to house patients Thats right there are people on beds in the Emergency Room waiting for a room on the floors to open up Meanwhile UMMC the states only level 1 trauma hospital (in Jackson) has started putting ER patients in a parking garage that is beside the hospital We are all waiting for a major university to just say "We are going back online for the fall" But it is rumored that wont be done until after the last day to withdraw from a college course passes (so they can make money) Translation: Its a shit show down here folks,mississippiwildman,16287760520,904

gwja6gl,n2hns4,**Michigan is now hospitalizing more people under 40 than those over 80 for COVID-19** Dr Stacey Sensor says her 18-year-old son a high school senior is "one of the healthiest people I know" "He works out every single day at five oclock in the morning" said Sensor a Gaylord physician "He takes all these supplements He only eats healthy And he got COVID at the gym "He was quite sick for about eight days" she said "So Im telling you that it doesnt matter what supplements you take what your age is Even in the healthiest individual they still can get it and they can still become very sick and then the effects can be there for quite some time" Its a cautionary tale she said for people who see COVID-19 as a serious health threat for the elderly but a much more benign illness for younger healthier people In fact Michigans current coronavirus surge has turned that assumption on its head: Last week the state was averaging more hospital admissions for COVID patients under 40 than patients age 80 or older The former was about 78 a day compared to 50 for the latter according to data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services The biggest reason for the demographic shift experts say: The difference in vaccination rates About 74% of Michigan residents age 70 and older have gotten at least one dose of vaccine and two-thirds are fully vaccinated For those 16 to 49 the numbers are 36% who have gotten one dose and 23% fully immunized; there is no vaccine authorized for children under 16 Also contributing to the surge of virus among young people is the spread of variants that are both more contagious and more lethal; the tendency of many younger adults to disregard COVID-19 guidelines and the fact that schools have reopened "Its definitely become more of a young person disease now probably because they havent been vaccinated and theyve been more likely than older folks to go out and about be in close contact with others and go to gatherings" said Dr Mark Hamed a physician who is medical director for Huron Lapeer Sanilac Tuscola Alcona Iosco Ogemaw and Oscoda counties The numbers bear that out In the first year of the pandemic Michigan residents age 60 and older accounted for 23% of cases; its now 13% Conversely those under age 20 accounted for 13% of cases during the first 12 months of the pandemic; its now 25% The chart below shows the April case numbers by age group compared to the monthly average through March 2021 as well as compared to December 2020 during the fall surge [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/WNTiwqVd1gGfPM09p2D0qzVgFZY=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/VQGMMSPTZNGADOVJQPKGAWILMQPNG) In theory thats actually a welcomed shift from the standpoint that old age is easily the biggest risk factor for being hospitalized or dying of COVID-19 But experts have been taken aback by the spike in COVID-19 hospitalizations among younger adults and children Compared to the height of the fall surge in early December Michigans average daily hospitalization admissions for COVID-19 are up 33% for those age 18 to 29 58% for thirty-somethings and 64% for those in their 40s Meanwhile hospitalizations for those age 80 and older are down 60% compared to December [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/86v1e7Apdm4-zWbHd-9Q7X4rAh0=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/RPEUG3IW5JGXTF6HQYL2RBK67Upng) "Its like you take what we were seeing before and shift it down by one or two decades" said Dr Joel Fishbain an infectious disease specialist for Beaumont Hospital in Grosse Pointe "Weve got 20-year-olds who are getting admitted and 30-year-olds requiring oxygen which we never saw before and needing as much treatment as we can give them Weve got 40- and 50-year-olds ending up on ventilators" Pediatric cases also are up Last week the state was averaging almost 10 hospital admissions a day among pediatric patients with COVID-19 triple the number in mid-February Deaths among children and younger adults have spiked too In the first 13 months of the pandemic there were six deaths among children ages 10 to 19 In the past month four deaths were reported Another 65 deaths were reported in April for 20- and 30-somethings quadruple the monthly average The chart below compares April deaths to the monthly average through March 2021 as well as to confirmed COVID deaths in December The numbers show how deaths among seniors plummeted in April compared to December as a result of vaccinations while coronavirus variants spiked deaths among unvaccinated people under age 50 [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/caQyJGE9C2BiswUM2ThU22RJumk=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/ZXCIGC7VWZCN7H65ULFSFE4GPIPNG) Deaths and hospitalizations arent the only concern While most COVID patients under age 50 "dont get severely ill there are a growing number of people who have long-haul COVID symptoms" said Dr Liam Sullivan an infectious disease specialists with Spectrum Health in Grand Rapids "They have problems with smelling with taste with concentration with memory with fatigue with night sweats "So even though they had a mild illness the first time around theyre still dealing with these things month and months later and thats not something you want to deal with when youre 25 or 35" he said "Of course you dont want to deal with it at any age but especially when youre in the prime of your life" And for women the research is growing on the dangers of COVID-19 during pregnancy Dr Kurt Wharton an Oakland County obstetrician currently has four pregnant patients in intensive care units battling COVID-19 All four are "fighting for their lives" said Wharton who works at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak While COVID-19-related deaths among pregnant women remain very rare Wharton and others say the evidence is growing that coronavirus during pregnancy can put a woman at a much higher risk of preterm birth preeclampsia and admission to the ICU and/or intubation especially if the woman has pre-existing conditions such as high blood pressure obesity diabetes or heart disease Evidence growing on COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy: Virus is dangerous; the shots are not Doctors offer several theories on why more younger people are getting significantly ill with COVID-19 in the current surge One is the spread of variants which are both more contagious and more lethal The variants are "stickier" Hamed said which means it takes less exposure to make someone severely ill or even symptomatic Wharton noted the same pattern happened during the 1918 influenza pandemic The initial surge in the spring of 1918 primarily impacted the elderly and babies But the virus mutated and came roaring back in the fall of 1918 and its primary victims during that surge were younger adults "History is repeating itself" Wharton said Another issue suggests Hamed and others: More unvaccinated people are gathering in groups without masks That increases the risk of exposure to a higher viral load which has been associated with more severe disease "The best mask you wear the less viral load you inhale" Wharton said On top that many schools have reopened and children and younger adults in particular are resuming their pre-pandemic social lives "You can see it" Wharton said "Younger people are all out in groups again walking down sidewalks shopping going to restaurants and bars together They just think theyre invulnerable" The good news is that COVID-19 vaccinations have proven "wildly successful" in significantly reducing the chances of getting the virus and spreading to others Sullivan said And just as vaccinations have blunted spread of the virus among senior citizens the spread of COVID among younger adults can be stymied through immunization shots Vaccination programs "really need to target the younger people right now" Sensor said "Theyre the ones who are getting sick Weve done a really good job of vaccinating our older population but to really move forward and get out of this pandemic we really need our younger people to step up to the plate and get the vaccine to protect themselves and protect their families",itsdr00,16198732450,154

hq5ut58,rpprbi,Im skeptical that this would *significantly reduce* transmission or death but it could be worth studying One way to study it would be to impose such a rule on a sample of flights while giving the people prevented from boarding alternative accommodations If you can show a statistically significant difference in *long-term* infections between those passengers against a control group then do it So for example if youre 20% less likely to catch COVID in the next six months because of this change that would be worth it I suspect however that the difference would be statistically insignificant,ExternalUserError,16406229930,57

h9pnz04,p8e6s6,"The Food and Drug Administration is pushing to approve Pfizer-BioNTechs two-dose Covid-19 vaccine on Monday further expediting an earlier timeline for licensing the shot according to people familiar with the agencys planning Regulators were working to finish the process by Friday but were still working through a substantial amount of paperwork and negotiation with the company The people familiar with the planning who were not authorized to speak publicly about it cautioned that the approval might slide beyond Monday if some components of the review need more time An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment The agency had recently set an unofficial deadline for approval of around Labor Day The approval is expected to pave the way for a series of vaccination requirements by public and private organizations who were awaiting firmer regulatory backing before implementing mandates Federal and state health officials are also hoping that an approved vaccine will draw interest from some Americans who have been hesitant to take one that was only authorized for emergency use a phenomenon suggested by recent polling Some universities and hospitals are expected to mandate inoculation once a vaccine is fully approved The Pentagon earlier this month said it plans to make Covid vaccinations mandatory for the countrys 13 million active-duty troops "no later" than the middle of next month or sooner if the FDA acts earlier The timing of the approval could result in an uncomfortable messaging problem for the Biden administration which on Wednesday announced that fully vaccinated people should prepare to get booster shots eight months after they received second doses Approving the vaccine and encouraging boosters at the same time may suggest to some that the vaccine as licensed is inadequate without an extra shot The FDA last week updated its authorizations of Pfizer-BioNTechs and Modernas vaccine to allow third doses for some immunocompromised people a decision backed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Regulators are still reviewing Modernas application for full approval for its coronavirus vaccine and a decision could come at least several weeks after the one for Pfizer-BioNTech",urbanpencil,16294944330,203

hdlacvc,prsbj3,The headlines are skewing this VERY positively This is actually not very reassuring data in terms of likelihood getting the vaccine approved There wasnt enough COVID observed particularly severe illness/hospitalization to determine clinical efficacy which is why they had to use antibody response as a surrogate endpoint Antibody levels are not a very good measure of real world clinical efficacy and its unclear what they mean and how much benefit they actually confer particularly in children The FDA may have a hard time issuing the EUA in the coming weeks with the data we have now and I wouldnt at all be surprised if they ask for more After all EUA stands for **Emergency** Use Authorization and the virus hardly qualifies as an emergency in children based on this data Id love to argue that its an emergency in adults and vaccinating kids would help but in general we have a real tough time approving interventions in kids without evidence of much direct benefit to them particularly under EUA I know Im gonna get downvoted for this but Im a resident pediatrician and I truly wanted this to work more than anyone Disappointed with how the data shook out At the same time I wouldnt want anything to be approved without CLEAR evidence that the benefit outweighs the risk and its hard to say we have enough data to determine that at this time,chocoholicsoxfan,16321461530,50

gucx0l4,mpzwzj,Oy Not great for the US but we will probably be OK Terrible for the world Sounds like its a common issue to the technology of the AZ and J&J vaccines Good summary of the AZ issue here: https://blogssciencemagorg/pipeline/archives/2021/04/12/az-oxford-calculations Edit: Hey folks read the article I posted Its understood this is a very rare event A not-fake adverse event even very rare is still bad when vaccine hesitancy could be a problem Its not as simple as "lightning strikes who cares" and its complicated by the fact that risks vary among various populations both for COVID-19 and vaccines Countries are making changes in public health policy in the case of AZ and are likely to continue to update policy as we get more information Edit2: A positive way of looking at this and vaccine hesitancy is as follows: > Its pretty hard to claim theres a vast conspiracy to suppress secret deaths and side effects when the whole damn system literally stops because it found 6 cases of a thing out of 7 million doses https://twittercom/maggiekb1/status/1381990938281615360,rocketwidget,16183125650,250
gud3uq1,mpzwzj,The problem is that these HIT like clotting reactions at least for the A-Z vaccine happen in a demographic whose morbidity and mortality from COVID isnt as high 1 in a million might be acceptable but 1 in a hundred thousand may start getting close to the chances of becoming really ill with COVID,Doctor_Realist,16183172350,157
gue6p4u,mpzwzj,I think many folks are giving the antivaxxers too much credit Irrational people that seek out false information were always going to make irrational decisions based on false information I doubt a material number of people will change their decision on whether to get vaccinated based on this recent decision by the FDA/CDC We got months to go before we can conclude whether we can vaccinate our way to herd immunity Then policy can be shaped appropriately and cultural norms will sort themselves out Regardless I think the data is pointing to covid being an issue for the forseeable future as there are simply too many global cases with too much mutation going on Hopefully and probably with annual boosters COVID will be something that doesnt impact our daily lives too much unless youre extremely unlucky and/or an antivaxxer,GideonWainright,16183354250,8
guf7zfe,mpzwzj,Honestly this situation makes me MORE confident in the COVID vaccines in general Look at how careful they are being that six complications out of over six million causes them to shut it down Literally less than one in a million chance of developing a blood clot and they are saying thats an unacceptable level of risk? That makes me feel kinda safe Unfortunately a lot of people lack critical thinking skills and wont consider that But I feel like a LOT of those are the ones who think its all Bill Gates 5G mind control tracking implants anyway,Tiny_Project6686,16183526300,7
gufnark,mpzwzj,Even if it did cause these rare blood clots and the evidence doesnt show that at all it would still be worth the risk Acknowledging the risk while still giving the vaccine would be far more reasonable and effective Thats the thing I cant get past COVID has a fatality and complication rate far higher than these blood clots so we should take the vaccine either way,andrewaltogether,16183605400,4
gue62ir,mpzwzj,The vaccines are incredibly safe The odds of having a blood clot or dying for one are miniscule at best And certainly much lower than dying or having LONG covid Even for Young people University of Cambridge did an excellent mathematical treatment here with supporting charts: [https://wintoncentremathscamacuk/news/communicating-potential-benefits-and-harms-astra-zeneca-covid-19-vaccine/](https://wintoncentremathscamacuk/news/communicating-potential-benefits-and-harms-astra-zeneca-covid-19-vaccine/) Even people under 30 are better off taking the vaccine vs the chance of Covid And this is for fatality only One could get Covid and have long term disability as well And this is for the Astra-Zeneca vaccine compared to which the J&J has fewer instances of blood clots,iamjimmy15,16183351510,11

guee151,mpzwzj,I am so done with all of this The vaccination program in the Netherlands is already pretty lackluster Weve stopped giving people under 60 AstraZeneca but even those above 60 are cancelling their appointment because they are scared of bloodclotting Now the delay of this vaccine is going to cost us even more delays and distrust People need to start putting things into perspective It was calculated that getting these bloodclots (in relation to AstraZeneca atleast) is in between getting killed by a dog and getting struck by lightning Even taking birth control has a much higher risk for bloodclots Please do keep looking into these side-effects I dont mean to marginalize them cause they are really severe but stop halting the vaccination process so much More people are going to die of COVID because of these delays than from this extremely rare clotting,Tre-ben,16183386790,1

gudimxm,mpzwzj,Glad I resisted the urge to get the J&J when it was offered to me after I heard it was generally much less effective than the mRNA vaccines and that there was also blood clot risk People were reporting this weeks ago and I guess people werent really listening Who knows how prevalent the risk of clotting is but I can guarantee is going to be much higher than the reported numbers here They didnt pull J&J for reported allergic reactions which are as common as 1 in 10000 of recipients This clotting is way more prevalent than theyre reporting and its okay not to want to take that risk and waiting for a Moderna or Ptzier vaccine The COVID vaccines have become a sacred cow for some people and you risk infuriating them for raising valid safety concerns for some of the less effective and less safe vaccines like the J&J and AstraZeneca,SteamyRocks,16183247720,1

gue5f9l,mpzwzj,https://healthscimcmasterca/news-events/news/news-article/2021/03/22/mcmaster-scientist-resolves-covid-19-clot-question If the clotting is caused by the immune response (antibodies and platelets) wont it stand to reason that the patient could be given blood thinners on a temporary basis? I think the antibodies go away after a period of time (how long?) and then its the remaining T-Cells that help with an immune response during the next exposure? So presumably there would be no need to be on blood thinners permanently? Although what confuses me is this: Once we go back to normal and people have been vaccinated isnt the whole point that their body will ramp up and make a ton of antibodies real quick in response to exposure to the actual virus? Does this mean there is a risk of blood clotting due to viral exposure for those who have been vaccinated regardless of the vaccine? I need someone who understands immunology better than me to explain all this Does it seem like those who are having the severe reaction to the vaccine are the same folks who would have had a crazy immune system overreaction to the virus? What is it about some peoples immune systems? It is kind of scary to think that were trying to vaccinate for a virus where the main cause of virulence is it wrecks havoc on the immune system,Calendar_Girl,16183348630,1

hdap4rv,pq0mfs,If politicians are going to strong arm restaurant workers to do the dirty work of enforcing covid precaution policies then they need to step up and give them more protections from abuse from a partially hostile and dangerous minority of the public There needs to be increased penalties for this type of behavior or restaurants should refuse to cooperate whenever someone puts up any resistance Instead they should just seat them and quietly call the police and report them If anybody tries to ticket them for serving them food then you have it on record that you reported it to the police to be dealt with but the police didnt do anything about it so you felt unsafe refusing service to a potentially hostile person without a police presence for protection to trespass the patron Eventually the police unions will get sick of thousands of calls a day to deal with diners who refuse masks or providing proof of vaccination and they will vet the policy reversed because god forbid we task law enforcement with enforcing pandemic control measures instead of restaurant hostesses,kismetschmizmet,16319405890,1

hsatnno,s11bxi,I live in king county WA largely democratic but the minority of people who refuse to mask up or get vaxxed account for a vast majority of hospitalizations and are also responsible for spreading this disease without any regard for human life I have lost loved ones from this disease as have so many others Hospitals are at capacity Its so frustrating to see people in the grocery store or out in public just refusing to wear a mask at this point what can be done? They have to know we are all in the middle of a global pandemic but they make a conscious decision and concerted effort to harm others and avoid any and all safety measures they refuse to follow guidelines and said guidelines are rarely enforced You ask them politely to be considerate and they swear and insult you its political to them and to everyone else its life and death Its really starting to become so sickening that the next time I see someone In safeway without a mask you can only assume they are also unvaxxed ill politely tell them to be considerate and wear a mask if they call me names or cough in my direction like others have i might just have to beat them over the head with an object I find nearby perhaps a #10 can Ive done everything I possibly can do to avoid catching or spreading this disease Im vaxxed boosted I mask up everytime I am out in public and meanwhile the people who refuse to do so are the ones responsible for covid longevity and the mutations If 100% of the population were to have masked from the beginning & if 100% of the population were vaccinated wed be a lot better off We might have been able to improve the situation for everyone but because a certain percentage of the population refuse to do anything were all worse off AntivXxers are literally the reason this virus is being allowed to mutate and spread so rapidly The only thing these people are doing by refusing to mask up is allowing the disease to spread further Life as we know it is over and I blame anti maskers and anti vaxxers and I am beyond mad Ive lost hope and I honestly dont care at this point but I want these people to know that its not going to be tolerated they cant be allowed to continue to be selfish and knowingly spread a deadly disease If we ever want things to go back to normal or even semi normal the people who refuse to do the right thing or even the bare minimum they might get the message if any time they are seen maskless in public for starters theyll be asked politely to mask up if they refuse or get confrontational they should be severely beaten this needs to be the norm Everytime they go out in public and refuse to wear a mask and refuse at the behest of others to do so they deserve serious physical injuries They do not deserve to be out in public with all the other people who have actually made an effort to reduce the spread of covid19 People who sacrificed so much and who have literally put their lives on hold to prevent this disease their sacrifices are diminished while the antimaskers behave as if nothing is wrong Their ignorance should not be allowed to continue to harm others Antivaxxers and anti maskers who arent already dead from the disease deserve to be harshly ridiculed and possibly assaulted into cooperation or worse if need be I know this may sound absurd to some of you but what other measures can be enacted?

hme469u,r42hz6,>Israels chief of public health services Dr Sharon Alroy-Preis warned Sunday that the potential for infection with the COVID variant omicron is "very high" but stressed that in cases where vaccinated people were infected they became only slightly ill Seems anecdotal still but honestly things are looking more and more promising by the day Hopefully we dont come to eat these words Keep in mind too that this is coming from Israels health department which is by far one of the most cautious and doom-laden in the world They were the first to signal that vaccines wane and they were the first to close borders when this variant came out They dont just say stuff like this,samuelc7161,16381006130,3080
hmekonz,r42hz6,Near the end of the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic (18 million dead as opposed to 5 million dead from covid so far) there emerged several fast-spreading but mild strains that eventually choked off the more potent strains and contributed to the end of the pandemic,md_reddit,16381106440,205
hme6ugu,r42hz6,South African Dr said her patients had very mild symptoms namely headache and fatigue but not the classic covid symptoms Likely a lot of people already have it but its so mild its not a issue The alarm makes sense though it it revealing itself to perhaps be a false one Heres hoping ,lacuuuuuna,16381026280,604
hmetpy9,r42hz6,I find myself having a hard time with some of the good news posts when Im not sure if theyre good news or not Any given group of 30 people who test positive are going to mostly have mild symptoms Its that one in 20 that ends up with serious trouble and typically those people are less healthy or older The problem with Covid has always been that the infectiousness makes that one and 20 a huge number when it hits millions of people So 5 to 30 people that are healthy enough to travel or young enough to travel might not be the best basis for making any conclusions So I guess its good we dont see extreme illness or some big change there it is sounding at a minimum similar to other types of Covid But I guess Im not ready to make any conclusions about whether its milder until we see a few hundred or thousand people with it,thestereo300,16381149010,56
hmefhn8,r42hz6,That is somehow a bit misleading and all media are just copy pasta African doctors said one new symptom of the Omicron seems to be very high blood pressure and even stronger fatigue (compared to delta) This could be a serious issue for older people or for people with already high blood pressure Also if it stays as a long covid condition,mkdr,16381078800,65
hmf78lp,r42hz6,Reuters had an article quoting at least two doctors who had Omicron patients None of them had hospital-worthy symptoms All mild Not even a loss of taste and smell They also noted every patient who had come up positive for this variant were under 40 Seems like the original theory that Covid would just play out as this endemic thing with mild(er) symptoms might be true,peepjynx,16381206360,7
hmeg80l,r42hz6,Dr John Campbell has a new video where he consulted with 2 doctors in SA who have worked with the new Covid variant The doctors said the symptoms of this variant are "mild" [https://wwwyoutubecom/watch?v=cdkCVeWc1pQ](https://wwwyoutubecom/watch?v=cdkCVeWc1pQ),CharlieDarwin2,16381082900,13

hmet172,r42hz6,The one advantage of increased transmissibility but much less virulent is basically getting everyone "vaccinated" without strains on the hospital However if its much more transmissible than there is a much much greater chance of mutations down the line especially if the initial reports that vaccinated patients are still likely to get the disease Either this marks the end of COVID or we get something worse and wipes out a massive portion the population,afoogli,16381145980,3
hmidvk4,r42hz6,Easy now everyone Think logical If Omicron actually turns out to cause milder Covid-19 as indicated here [https://wwwbusinessinsidercom/omicron-coronavirus-variant-cases-mild-south-africa-2021-11?r=US&IR=T](https://wwwbusinessinsidercom/omicron-coronavirus-variant-cases-mild-south-africa-2021-11?r=US&IR=T) we could in fact have a natural vaccine coming our way Just saying in its almost inevitable journey to become another cold (milder vira having an advantage in allowing people to be more mobile) it has to undergo mutations on the way Could be Omicron is an important step in that direction,NotTooSceptic,16381745430,2
hmedm8n,r42hz6,This is very irresponsible to downplay seriousness of new strain because a few cases have not developed any serious symptoms YET Covid19 has been there for about two years now and we should have learned by now that people can get tested positive even before developing symptoms and serious symptoms like pneumonia appear later on It is even said that 10th day of symptoms is make or break Now if they monitor a couple tens ideally hundreds of new strain cases and see that significantly smaller percentage of people develop serious symptoms throughout around two weeks then you can start publishing that new strain does not cause serious symptoms,raimis78,16381068380,18
hmg0lls,r42hz6,Since Omicron is so different from Delta would it be possible to contract both at the same time? Maybe even more than two? Like a covid Royal Flush,BokiGilga,16381323410,1
hme9g7l,r42hz6,Looks like this new variant doesnt cause severe disease like the previous COVID variants It can outcompete the delta variant but that doesnt mean that people will experience severe symptoms The mutations of the spike protein change the shape of the virus It doesnt mean that the virus can easily attach to the cell or that it can escape the immune system This virus can disappear like the previous variants such as alpha or lambda I think that the world is panicking again making the situation much worse than it is The biggest panic can be seen in the financial markets,Chernobyl_Bio_Robot,16381043370,-13

h28g44h,nzm2oo,most of the comments in here make me realize the internet is full of people that just read headlines and never the article The article headline is flimsy at best based on the data as I see no strong correlation between covid numbers rising and getting the jab There are almost equal amounts of low vax rates and low cases as there are high vax rate low cases and further pa for example is almost above the national avg and yet advertises over a 70% vax rate If you consider those that had covid plus those that have been jabbed shouldnt pa be at herd immunity? What this also doesnt take into consideration are variants In certain counties which they curiously picked but I probably would have too in my study there is no differentiator for variants We are already seeing strong real world data showing that many of the vaccines are very ineffective against the D variant originally discovered in India Indias numbers have plummeted but there are widespread reports of falsification of data there so much like Chinas reporting I dont think we can trust that this will just disappear I think the UK is our canary in the coalmine at this point so early into the emergence of this variant There are many folks like myself that just simply dont trust the science behind so much of what has occurred since day 1 of this modern day plague Being allergic to PEG to the point that using shampoo with it causes a mild rash I was told not to take the current offerings and wait for better news to come out for the J/J But all we hear from them is bad news between blood clots and corrupted vials in the millions I feel like the entire globe especially reddit users would like to over simplify vaccines and how to stop this disease Remember the idea of a manufactured disease was laughed at and even censored on these very forums not too long ago Now both sides of the political spectrum are realizing there was an orchestrated cover up by Peter Daszak So what new discoveries will there be about the variants the effectiveness claims of the current vaccines against the new variants and long term effects of the vaccine that lets not forget were originally slated for emergency FDA clearance for older and immune compromised individuals because the potential risk of the vaccine far outweighed the potential risk of covid which for those in that category was a very strong chance of death or at a minimum a painful long possibly perpetual recovery period Harvard and Yale doctors came out together and said there is no reason to vaccinate the young the risks are unknown and the risk of covid for those is also low: [https://wwwmsncom/en-us/health/medical/harvard-stanford-doctors-say-mandating-the-coronavirus-vaccine-unethical/vi-AALbqNq?ocid=entnewsntp&pc=U531](https://wwwmsncom/en-us/health/medical/harvard-stanford-doctors-say-mandating-the-coronavirus-vaccine-unethical/vi-AALbqNq?ocid=entnewsntp&pc=U531) Heres my problem with their statements though As someone pointed out the effectiveness of the vaccines are high and your risk of having a break through case drops dramatically if others are also vaccinated Younger people have been known to be asymptomatic and as such are more likely to spread it as younger people are generally more social in person than older people I dont have the answers but to try and paint this as a black/white conversation is foolish I hope the vaccinated dont have long term health issues but if they did you could bet they wouldnt come back on these forums and apologize to those of us that cant get the current vaccines or are fearful because our scientists and medical community especially our government has shown to be at best a bit inept confused and politically motivated,HyprSl0th,16240387040,0

h0la381,nrqtko,Every year just before the height of flu season we should have a national pandemic preparedness week where we mask up in public work/school from home if we can and get people accustomed to what needs to be done when theres a virus going around Sure COVID is a once-a-century thing but that doesnt mean another similar virus cant happen in 1 5 or 10 years Heck with variants Id say were more likely than ever to have a new pandemic next year Getting kids educated about how to act during a pandemic should be as common as lessons on "stop drop and roll" Additional benefit of having everyone across the country do this is we could put a significant dent in the number of flu cases and flu deaths,trevdak2,16228279610,0

hrp557e,ryb5hr,Vaxxed and boosted person here Everyone I know is also vaxxed and boosted Americas leadership is broken its healthcare system is broken and a significant part of its adult population is also broken eg too stupid to get a shot or make their kids get a shot Locking myself down like I did during the first year doesnt seem like itll do anything except make me miserable The local opera company decided to cancel their shows due to omicron so instead Ill be at the movie theater on Sunday Im done Im going back to normal as much as Im legally allowed and Ill just have to hope the people in positions to fix our systems figure something else out Ethically possibly questionable? Although from a utilitarian perspective Im fairly convinced me locking down would accomplish mostly nothing Im just tired of living in a perpetual state of emergency when my risk is basically a sore throat due to my age and vaccination status If COVID is bad for the US healthcare system I guess the healthcare system will burn down to ash because COVID is never going away My wife who is in grad school for nursing also isnt locking down either,houndoftindalos,16415938150,6
hrpb059,ryb5hr,The hospitalizations are definitely on the rise again and it is hard to predict the peak The healthcare system doesnt have a lot of margin to adjust so this has been a really tough time for every level of the system The good news though is that there are significantly fewer hospitalizations per case so far when compared to all the previous waves In Pennsylvania where one of the doctor interviewed is working the average new cases per day is 22000 and the total number of hospitalized patients is 5600 During the delta wave as the new case levels were nearing their peak in mid September there were only 5800 cases but hospitalizations were already at 2300 4 times as many cases but only twice as many hospitalizations Twice as many hospitalizations terrible for sure but still below the number on the initial wave The article also states that hospitalizations fall 2 weeks behind cases I dont see that trend in the data Total hospitalizations start to go down a week to 10 days after cases start to go down but that is from people being released from the hospital The upward side of the trend seems to be no more than a couple days behind the case count and sometimes not even that All these numbers generally jive in the national numbers as well though with different dates Like I said I feel for hospital workers and their struggle is very real But I think it is helpful to mention the positive trends with the negative ones especially in a time where it can seem like the only news we get is negative Vaccines ARE working Omicron IS less severe than Delta and the mortality rate has been declining consistently There is hope for things to get better (This data is pulled from the CDCs COVID Data Tracker Not posting a link to respect subreddit rules),intrepidpursuit,16415960970,2

"Its not sustainable or affordable to buy every person on the planet a new car each year" Regardless hard to believe that this wouldnt be a solvable problem Especially with variants more likely to come from unvaccinated populations (in poorer countries) theres a huge incentive to build out vaccination infrastructure I wonder how perceptions will change in the future Theres a lot of frustrated "Im done with this" comments in this thread which is fair enough I guess but for me personally if it were a 15 minute errand each year to get a booster / update and mitigate some of the risk of getting covid I cant imagine why I wouldnt do that Ive been getting the flu shot for years Even if it were just a mild reduction in the chances of contracting a mild illness I would still do that,pseudont,16413323950,0

hqripxf,rt54vc,TLDR; If youre using an antigen at-home rapid test wait until 2-3 days after symptom onset (but quarantine before then ofc) Family of 4 (50M 14F 16F 22F (myself)) We were exposed to COVID either on Christmas or the 26th (a close family friend (50Ms girlfriends son 15M with whom he was in the car with for 3+hours on the 26th) had a fever on the 26th confirmed positive PCR test on the 28th) Weve been quarantining since the 26th Day 0: 50M 16F and I took a QuickVue antigen test on the 28th They were all negative At this point 50M had a scratchy throat and was mildly coughing The rest of us had no symptoms I started getting a tickly throat (that feeling of "oh here it comes") late at night Didnt test 14F that night because the tests arent cheap :) and we were quarantining anyways At this point if one of us had it the rest of us did Day 1: The next morning 14F woke up with a fever Myself and 16F woke up with sore throats a headache fatigue and coughing 50M stayed the same I felt pretty rough that night had intense night-sweats and lots more coughing 14F broke her fever half-way through the day Day 2: 14F and 16F are feeling much better! Yay! Hardly any symptoms just mild coughing and runny nose I have worse coughing fatigue scratchy throat runny nose nausea 50M doing pretty much the same as he was--just a scratchy throat and coughing At this point its just been a bad cold for us or akin to a case of bronchitis We all took more at-home tests: 2 QuickVue 2 BinaxNOW All 4 came back positive Day 3 (today): 50M lost his sense of smell dampened sense of taste This didnt happen during his first run with COVID (April 2020) Still has similar symptoms but theyve gotten better Im doing much better still occasionally coughing & headaches/cold symptoms 14F and 16F are practically symptom-free now just a bit of coughing 14F and 16F were 2x Pfizer vaccinated in June 2021 (date of second dose) 50M was 2x Moderna vaccinated in January 2021 but caught COVID early-on from hospital work in April 2020 Was a fairly severe case lasted 15 months but no hospitalization I was vaccinated 2x Pfizer in April 2021 None of us received the booster yet I think we all caught Omicron as the symptoms are relatively mild 14F 16F and I have never had COVID before A bit sad we caught it after 2 years of not catching it 50M isnt as cautious with masking/avoiding crowded areas procedures as we are Some anecdotal evidence if you will We all tested negative the first round of testing and all tested positive the second round of testing So you may want to wait until 2-3 days after the start of symptoms before you do an at-home test Best of luck to everyone!

hqsktkf,rt54vc,I currently have covid very likely omicron (though I dont know for sure Im sharing symptoms with confirmed omicron cases and not with og/delta cases) and I think there must be an issue with detection and early testing I was symptomatic for four days before I tested positive (symptoms started afternoon of 25th and my lateral flow came back positive on 29th - I then took a pcr test on 30th which was also positive) Alarmingly though I tested negative twice with lateral flow tests on 26th and 27th and also had a negative result from a pcr test taken on 26 And Ive heard of long gaps between infection and testing positive increasingly in the last two weeks Technically given the negative pcr test on the 26th I could have gone back to work and my symptoms would have been dismissed as cold symptoms which is what I think is contributing to the spread People arent testing positive negative quickly and especially if they are asymptomatic are going into the community and unknowingly infecting people in the days before they test positive Fortunately someone else in my household (we think the person who became infected first and so was further into it) tested positive so we just decided to ignore the test results and isolate to be cautious,thatstoomuchsauce,16410330480,3

How are you gonna put your faith in other people when half your population either refuses to get vaccinated or buys fake vaccination certificates? How do you trust anyone?

ha7111a,pamuzn,after pumping the message of "get vaxed resume life" nonstop putting a new message like this out there which will be interpreted as: "on an individual level theres an undefined amount of additional work to be done afterwards and then maybe well see" is counterproductive imo we cant get double the vaccines in our arms to make up for the stubborn idiots we cant put twice the amount of masks on to make up for the people that dont wear them and we cant lockdown twice as hard for the idiots that partied on spring break throughout the previous peaks reward good reward and punish bad the work that still needs to be done is with local leaders hospitals setting policy companies setting policy for staff etc pivoting from "get vaccinated resume life" to "get vaccinated require vaccines for those ready to resume life resume life" seems like an easier more actionable pivot to accomplish something (besides just inspiring defeatism) than "get vaccinated hope that the dumbest lowlifes catch on eventually and maybe next year you get to live again but stay tuned" on a community level if we could require vaccines/proof of negative tests to participate in "normal" life sooner i think hammering that message would do more to incentivize individuals than when only looking at things nationally/globally good luck getting the crowd that has already done everything more or less right during quarantines mandates etc to continue paying attention while they watched a bunch of hicks bury their heads in the sand cancel out any progress and continue to stay tuned in after already sacrificing a year of life i know its complicated but seems so counterproductive not to spend time also highlighting the spots in the country that succeeded and have been able to have more normalcy already and to balance the national/international gloom and doom with the stark contrast from the cities and communities that have done it right look at floridas deaths currently surpassing the deaths of their previous peaks LONG AFTER A VACCINE HAS BEEN WIDELY AVAILABLE TO THEIR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS (eg 999% of the people that die from covid) then look at the cities that have reached 60-70%+ fully vaxed having music festivals outdoors with no burden on hospital capacity and (except for those highly at risk to begin with those in nursing homes or in healthcare or education) apart from slapping a mask on in an uber and grocery store already are back to normal it was (supposed to be) a team effort until there was a vaccine available for the most at risk which many never participated in or actively sabotaged while others did their part but now that there is a vaccine for the majority of the population and the majority of older folks have gotten it it isnt going to be a one-size-fits-all approach for each individual: qualifying for a vaccine vax rates in the individuals community co-morbidity occupation contact (or lack of contact) with at-risk or groups that cant yet get vaccinated all realistically play more of a role on how much "normal" you get to have the broader context is necessary but its an increasingly hard sell in healthy vaccinated populations to continue to buckle down seemingly endlessly when life itself is insanely short my community has done what it takes and it makes no sense to send a message to the group that has followed marching orders to now wait for the lowlifes in florida to catch up and then maybe u get your normal well be getting boosters before they get a faction of these morons vaccinated fuck em i think about all my friends that own businesses in chicago that barely stayed afloat before there was a vaccine reading this seeing this new "maybe" date (when it could instead be as simple as letting businesses set a policy to reward folks for getting vaccinated) because of some downstate/out of state hillbillies and it makes me sick,lisaleftsharklopez,16298309000,4

gx826m1,n6gbtd,I was told by my doctor its riskier to get the vaccine than to get COVID at my age I had Guillian-Barre triggered by my college vaccines and never fully recovered Moderna rejected me for the trials because of it There need to be medical exemptions,WantAssPics,16203511590,10
gx84xw9,n6gbtd,I think the biggest issue with rolling the vaccine out is if the government backs it and someone dies from an adverse effect of the vaccine then theyll be held accountable Im in the UK and Ive already heard people talk about if they get a blood clot from the Astrazenica one they will want financial compensation Ive also talked to people who have caught covid and because they havent got it bad have said its just nature trying to lower the population,baconsane,16203525650,2

gx92dz9,n6gbtd,This seems like either a poorly written article or a poorly written law not only does it not mention medical exemptions but it also states that people need to be fully vaccinated or you dont get sick paid leave which means that if youre waiting for your second dose or even first dose and you get sick youre still punnished despite attemping to get vaccinated Also denying paid sick leave to people is a sure fire way to get people to come to work with covid It seems like the law was written as an excuse to not pay people sick leave during a pandemic and not to encurage vaccination,Ferencak,16203757020,1

h66pzxv,opi0xh,I was partying in Nashville last weekend When we booked it it was a "we beat COVID party!" But flash forward to our arrival and stuff has been getting bad again Especially bad in Tennessee I saw some troubling headlines but we decided fuck it Were not gonna not party So we did and we did it harder than in the last 2 years Random girl wants to make out? Done Dancing way too close to people? Check Drinking a Corona from a bartender who totally put her lime in my drink with the same hand she grabbed my cash? Yup! All in baby I came home and when I woke up on Monday I had an awful cold I had read a story about someone saying if youre vaxxed and you have a cold its possibly COVID I was paranoid So I got a rapid test right away Negative But fuck that I want to make sure sure So I got the longer 24-72 test By Tuesday I felt fine It turns out it was just allergies Going from a hyper clean AirBnB to my house which is Im comparison kinda dusty kicked my ass I also forgot to take my nasal spray the day before But I still wanted that negative test And I got it yesterday (47 hours after I got tested) Negative again So I got absurdly lucky Either I interacted with someone with COVID and the vaccine did a kickass job or I got even luckier and in a COVID hot spot I didnt bump into COVID at all I will say that any girls I hooked up and managed to actually talk to (about half) were out of towners from liberal states and all got the vaccine Anyway the vaccine (PFIZER) I got helped me feel like I wasnt in peril I have asthma so Im sure COVID would do a number on my lungs I dont think it will kill me probably especially with the vaccine but any further lung damage would be life changing I just stopped needing an inhaler within the last 5 or so years Is there a point to this way way too long message? Just that I felt like the vaccine would help me And Im pretty sure it did It was a gamble for sure but also a mental thing I think me and all my friends really needed 88% is damn good odds PS Nashville is fucking awesome Its like a 3-1 ratio girls to guys Its like Tinder but in real life and you have such a better shot with every girl out there When everything is cool again (assuming it ever is) check it out Edit: firstly shame a positive vaccine story gets downvoted here but fine Guess I wont be defending this shit anymore Good luck,PeterDarker,16269960890,-3

h82r4de,ozr842,How about we focus on immunity rather than vaccination status? I had COVID 8 months ago and have tested myself multiple times for antibodies and T-cells Most recently as of two days ago I still have plenty of antibodies If you havent had COVID get vaccinated! If you already have it get vaccinated if you want to But there should be an alternative given you can prove youve tested for antibodies and T-cells,holamund0,16283571360,9
h828k8x,ozr842,Im my mind the only reasonable argument to be made for vaccine mandates is to avoid overwhelming hospitals with sick people I dont think its the governments job to protect people from themselves unless that harm also creates a negative externality for others (like not getting treated for other conditions when all the ICU beds are fill with Covid patients) That said I think many who support mandates are operating on the false assumption that these vaccines are sterilizing or offer enough protection to fully prevent the spread of the virus from vaccinated persons If the virus can still spread whats the point? Also how long before mandated vaccines drop further in efficacy (of preventing spread)? And what does am enforcement regime look like when the science is constantly updating and bureaucracy is slow to adjust?,DavenportBlues,16283483930,3
h81wnkn,ozr842,**[Another perspective if anyone wants it](https://twittercom/KimmelmanJ/status/1423696072065552389)** Just had an extended conversation with a worker who has- thus far- refused to get a COVID vaccine 1/ So many of his concerns were ones I share He is worried about doctors and healthcare systems being bought off by companies 2/ He is worried that too few people are running the world- and that these people know how to use guile fear emotion and if need be brute force to consolidate and extend their wealth and power 3/ He sees in COVID a dense and reinforcing network of governments restricting liberties: controlling and tracking travel deciding what people wear what people put in their bodies And he doesnt trust that governments intentions here are entirely beneficent 4/ He thinks a lot of people- especially in the professional class- are too uncritical of what they read hear and are told to do 5/ He thinks everything human beings touch gets destroyed And thinks we should be open to the possibility that COVID is not a natural event [and its not! all infectious diseases have their origins in human incursions of some sort] 6/ He is not anti-vaccine He sometimes performs work at a major hospital and has seen COVID first hand And he doesnt doubt the science behind the COVID vaccine 7/ So far (except for #4 above) he and I are on the same page [but I see his point about governments forming dense networks of policy to favour their private taskmasters] 8/ And he respects that people might chose not to hire him if he is not vaccinated 9/ He is just sick of being shamed for not getting the vaccine And sick of people dismissing the premises that motivate his hesitancy 10/ So my point here is that a) if you foster conditions where points #2-6 are plausible dont be surprised that some people resist vaccines And b) dont be dismissive of hesitants moral outlook or their capacity for reflection END/,tempdaddi,16283420980,-13

hnflckn,r9otza,Ive been teaching in China for 18 years and this is par for the course Ill first say Ive always worked in the private sector and there have been times that Ive been outsourced to public schools on occasion while working with a few schools in the past What a gong show Not criticizing China Just humanity in general So I came **right** after the WHO lifted the SARS travel ban to China Id planned on moving to China earlier and SARS ended up delaying my departure by a few months There are always sick kids coming to school It really broke my heart Id see kids as young as 4 years old coming to class run down and sick It just made me think "if youre going to run your kid into the ground like this at this age what kind of physical condition can you expect them to be in when theyre 30?" When H1N1 was a thing I was working 3 afternoons a week at a high school and DAMN I had classes where students were constantly going to the bathroom to puke their guts out 1/4-1/3 of the students were clearly effected I constantly encouraged them to go home but they didnt see it as an option because their teachers and parents didnt accept the practice of saying home to get better and not risk spreading their illness to others A few years later I had a kid come to school looking kinda sick and before class I asked the girls mother and she upright admitted that she was aware that her child was infected with FMD which can be extremely fatal to humans who are younger/have less developed immune systems I couldnt believe this woman I informed my co-workers of the situation We immediately locked all of the classrooms because we didnt want anyone in the other classrooms to get infected It literally took over an hour to convince the mother to take her child out of the school It was literally impossible to convince her that shed done something wrong by taking her child outside let alone to a school filled with other younglings She attempted to fight the manager when we told her that she wouldnt be able to bring her child back into the school without proof from a local hospital that her daughter was no longer contagious After the insane woman left we spent a few hours sanitizing everything in the school It must have been a weird experience for the kids and teachers in the other classrooms They normally would have finished class a long time ago and would have been let out of the classroom for breaks but they had to just hang out in the classroom while we insured that wed done our best to make sure it was safe for the kids to come out TBH we shouldnt have had anything to do with this process There should have been some division of the government to contact to have them ensure that this is done properly especially given how this disease is famous for coming through areas and taking the lives of children in waves but yeah we didnt have such a luxury at our disposal COVID wasnt nearly as bad The government had clearly learned from SARS and figured out a way to deal with it in their own way After the COVID lockdown had ended it was really nice to see so many kids come to class wearing masks I even had co-workers wearing masks when they had a cold which is something I couldnt have imagined happening ever before COVID COVID really made me question why the hell we havent been wearing masks when under the weather all of these years I think it should be a given You shouldnt be free to spread your germs when youre feeling ill just regardless of whether or not you live in a free country,ThaddCorbett,16387743750,13

hnhdvus,r9otza,This was always going to be true Irresponsible parents have been sending sick children to school everywhere before COVID Parents have knowingly send sick children to school with measles and whooping cough Parents have knowingly send sick children to school during known local outbreaks at that school for all kinds of diseases Parents sometimes dose the kids up on fever reducers and send them to school expecting to get bounced by lunch but just wanting the few hours of free child watching Its always happened and theres nothing about COVID to think it would be any different,oldman712,16388121240,1
hnea4jo,r9otza,I get the whole "look at the statistics! your kid is most likely going to be fine!" argument but at the same time theres a risk of going to school one day and there being a mass shooting Both have the low risk of actually happening but yet they do and both have risk of harming or killing people Why is it parents are getting in trouble for their kid shooting others but yet parents who knowingly send their covid-positive kid to school dont get in trouble?

hngskpl,r9otza,Stuff like this keeps happening and will continue happening It seems like there are rarely any legal repercussions for it and often these people are insulated by their culture of willful ignorance There was an outbreak in my community that landed numerous people in the hospital and directly lead to a death (that we know of) And it was all due to extreme ignorance and negligence The short version: Family did not "believe in" taking covid precautions No masks no social distancing no vaccine etc They went to a large wedding and a short while later came down with symptoms of covid But rather than get tested or isolate they went on vacation during a busy holiday weekend (if memory serves correct) At some point after they got back and only after their symptoms got worse and other people from the wedding started testing positive for covid they got tested No surprise they had covid Despite the test results the father went into to work afterwards And if all that wasnt bad enough one of the family members died They held a large funeral service with at least a hundred and likely many more people than that where covid precautions were not enforced For the sake of argument I can see why folks might give the family the benefit of the doubt in regards to going on vacation while sick but not being 100% certain its covid However going to work after getting back positive test results is malicious and/or negligent and its crazy that there are no repercussions for doing that And having a large funeral in the middle of a local outbreak is reckless and so irresponsible I dont even know how that was allowed to happen,AnnieDickledoo,16388035760,1

h8g1hqm,p1oqh4,I believe its really important for parents to have an idea of the risks of COVID to children so Ive been doing some research recently to assess the risks **I am not an expert -- so I welcome any comments -- but thought this may be helpful as parents navigate this worrisome time** (sorry if youve seen this before -- Ive reposted this on threads that talk about kids and COVID because I think its important to have some idea behind the risks): **Morality Risks:** Obviously theres an extremely fine line to walk here: every death of a child is horrendously tragic and I cannot imagine being the parent of a child who has died or been hospitalized The good news for parents however is that mortality risks still remain low [Out of 74000000 kids in the US 519 have died of COVID since the crisis began (as of July 28)](https://wwwnytimescom/2021/07/29/well/family/back-to-school-covidhtml) This works out to a mortality rate of 00007% or 0015% amongst those who had had confirmed cases of COVID Again this is immensely tragic -- simply put no child should die -- but if I were a parent Id probably be more worried about the prospects for long-term COVID symptoms (discussed below) **Risks of Delta:** Delta is new so there is still much we do not know However data from the UK (where Delta has hit for some time now) gives us some clues Lets start with the good news: [based on data from the UK kids remain the least impacted age group by a long shot](https://wwwonsgovuk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19latestinsights/hospitals#hospital-admissions-by-age)Despite not having access to vaccines kids age 5-14 still have had by far the lowest hospitalization rates of any demographic (this past week its been 108/100000; kids age 0-4 have had noticeably higher rates -- 312/100k -- though still lower than any other age group) Similarly the chance a child would be hospitalized if they had a confirmed case of COVID was similar to prior waves and maybe even a little bit lower The bad news? Well more kids are going to get Delta on account of it being more transmissible particularly in areas where schools arent taking any precautions We all know it and were seeing it now but Delta is insanely more transmissible The fact were already seeing records for hospitalizations amongst kids is extremely bad to say the least The fact this is already occurring with no indications cases nationally are close to peaking is really troubling (An aside: interestingly the UK never break their record for youth hospitalizations with Delta but were breaking it now I really dont know but if anyone has insight itd be interesting to hear) **Risks of Long COVID/The Disease Course More Generally:** We still have lots to learn about long COVID and Delta is new enough that current studies dont really address it For COVID more generally however the earliest studies suggested frighteningly high rates of long-lasting symptoms (one even pegged it at a third!) But these suffered from immense methodological weaknesses such as low sample sizes parental-reported symptoms probable selection bias and no control groups More recent research (which isnt perfect and still includes many of the above weaknesses but is at least somewhat better) has suggested much lower rates than the first studies albeit the risks are real A sampling of some of the more recent work include: * [In a self-reported survey in the UK over 95% of infected kids had no symptoms lasting longer than four weeks and 98% had no symptoms more than 56 days](https://wwwthelancetcom/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext)(and if Im understanding the study correctly it only analyzed kids with symptomatic COVID so there would be lower rates for all infections) * [In a survey from the UK of people who had COVID an estimated 74% of children aged 2-11 reported any symptoms 12 weeks after infection](https://wwwonsgovuk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/prevalenceofongoingsymptomsfollowingcoronaviruscovid19infectionintheuk/1april2021) (this study included a control group) * [In one study with a control group researchers found that kids infected with COVID in Zurich actually were no more likely to report symptoms of long-COVID than kids who were not infected](https://wwwnaturecom/articles/d41586-021-01935-7)To be clear: this study does not imply that long-Covid does not occur However if true it suggests the actual prevalence of long-COVID in kids is likely quite low (This is definitely the most encouraging study I found) So whats the average course of the illness in most children (again with the caveat that most research is pre-Delta)? First off it seems that \~50% of children will be totally asymptomatic ([the Lancet study](https://wwwthelancetcom/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext) cites a source suggesting between 43-68% of cases are asymptomatic) Of those with symptoms the one study found the median symptom duration is 6 days with the most common symptoms being headache and fatigue (see previous link) Three final notes: First we need to be careful when discussing long-COVID and differentiate between symptoms that are bad but manageable (and resolve over time) and symptoms which are debilitating Unfortunately to my understanding current research has not really addressed this adequately In the Lancet study at least (first bullet point) the most common symptoms that lasted in the children who had lasting symptoms were 1) fatigue 2) loss of smell and 3) (to a lesser degree) headaches This doesnt really resolve the question -- depending on the levels of fatigue for example it certainly can be debilitating -- but I think this is something we really shouldnt lose sight of when discussing long-COVID Second: Ive seen concerns on here about organ damage and the like I havent really seen great studies focusing on this on children (I very well may have missed some so do not take this as gospel) Moreover in the studies Ive run across on adults theres lots of jargon and its not always clear what the medical implications of certain findings are Thus I havent really focused on it here -- not because it might not exist but because its above my expertise and I do not want to misinterpret findings Third risks -- even quantified -- are hard to interpret and people will probably have different reactions to the same numbers Lets say [the Lancet study](https://wwwthelancetcom/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext) (showing 18% of children with symptomatic COVID have any symptoms lasting >56 days) is correct On the one hand -- if your child catches COVID -- this means he/she is extremely unlikely to have symptoms that last that long One the other hand -- this still means lots of kids will have symptoms that last a long time **Takeaways:** Building off this last point: people will look at the above data and likely come to different conclusions For me I look at it and feel somewhat reassured -- its not at all that theres zero risk (theres definitely not) and whats currently happening is absolutely tragic but the data speaks to somewhat lower risks than the impression Id likely get if I spent my whole day on this sub But then again Im also not a parent Others may look at the data (particularly the long-COVID studies) and still very reasonably feel worried **In any event -- and I know Im preaching to the choir here -- the most important thing you can do to protect the kids around you is get vaccinated And if you happen to be a parent with a children age 12 or over whos on the fence please get them vaccinated too Itll protect your child from a truly nasty disease and help lower the risk for those around your child too**,Adodie,16286229860,6

h8fv8hj,p1oqh4,There are two factors at play here: * Floridas state ban on school mask mandates * Increased Transmission from Delta There have been some [pretty robust](https://wwwnytimescom/2021/08/10/opinion/covid-schools-maskshtml) [studies](https://abcsciencecollaborativeorg/report-shows-that-n-c-k-12-schools-reopened-safely-paving-the-way-for-schools-nationwide-to-limit-covid-19-spread-in-the-classroom/) that show that at least for last years variants in-person education had very low transmission rates so long as everyone was wearing masks So the question is how much of this transmission is due to students not masking and how much is due to the increased transmission rate of the Delta variant? As the parent of kids who are in a school district thats headed back to in-person-with-masks-required school in a few weeks my hope is that masks are still effective enough to allow for safe in-person learning until under-12s can get vaccinated But we really dont know that yet If my kids were headed back to school tomorrow with the data we have available today in an environment where masks are required Id likely send them with N95 masks But well see what things look like in a few weeks when I have to make that decision for realsies,AtOurGates,16286203390,3

h8g7299,p1oqh4,I think at this point we have to just throw our hands up and accept that this thing has won We cant beat COVID with half the population insisting its a hoax against Donald Trump or "just the flu" or refusing to wear masks or thinking getting vaccinated can connect to my wifi signal or some other bat-sh\*\* crazy conspiracy For those who can still form complete sentences get vaccinated and buy N95 masks and where them everywhere you go especially in Florida where most people are actively pursuing COVID whether they know it or not,47952,16286253670,3

hkzxv30,qw0f3o,Disclosure: I got my booster as soon as I could Im generally in favor of boosters However my family was directly exposed to COVID multiple times after we were "fully vaccinated" as the Delta wave swept our area At one point it was said that getting Delta on top of fully vaccinated (or vice versa) provided a really strong immune boost (Dont intentionally do this in case you do have a bad breakthrough case) Are we to assume this is no longer the case? Also I have an autoimmune disorder I have had flares with this and other vaccines I am a little concerned about the inflammation from multiple vaccines Even though risk analysis is that the virus is riskier than the vaccine at what point does that start to no longer be the case?

Dunno not a doctor Ive had the flu before but this was something else SO got the shot its a matter of time before i need to but Im scared to death of the side effects Not trying to come off as antivax just anxiety I wear my mask everywhere edit: Sooooooo I did the thing for the greater good and took the shot Definitely teetered on the edge of anxiety and panic as I hate needles Had a staph/blood infection in my finger a long time ago and they inserted the needle from the tip of my finger downward about 1/4in so that was the most intense pain didnt feel anything on this covid shot but now im waiting for crappy symptoms,exccord,16184563220,2

hy7uwak,szo1gx,If you take into account the unexplained excessive deaths worldwide over the last 2 years its looking increasingly likely that the true death toll could be almost 40 million worldwide Every country has had a huge spike in the death rate and Covid is only officially responsible for about 25% of it,Rowdycc,16456920700,12
hy8bted,szo1gx,How about we look at some other diseases which we normally view with a collective shrug? Numbers who died in a single year (2015): * Heart disease: 88M * Stroke: 62M * Flu bronchitis pneumonia: 32M * COPD: 31M * Lung cancers: 17M * Diabetes: 16M * Alzheimers: 15M * Cholera and diarrhea diseases: 14M * Tuberculosis: 13M * Cirrhosis: 12M Comparatively speaking COVID is not out of the ordinary for a deadly disease and is fairly mild with the exception of the elderly (who have fewer years to lose unlike say diarrhea diseases that tend to kill infants) The difference with COVID is in the economic disruption due to massively disproportionate efforts to stop the pandemic coupled with an ill-prepared healthcare system,urgentbacklash5,16457042130,5
hy8lsaq,szo1gx,There is nothing normal about a population that wont universally take mitigating vaccines to buffer the health care system for all Thats called the USA 25% are so fucking stupid and selfish that we will see a large percentage of them die Time to get back to normal There are vaccines there are ways to mitigate There are antiviral treatments Now should we be adjusting some of our normal policies to account for the Covid? sure How about more sick days for people How about FMLA? How about making it so that people who die of Covid especially if they were vaccinated have their families cared for? Probably not gonna happen but its time to stop fucking around and get back to normal Take your vaccines get your treatments wear your mask and lets try to get through this It is endemic,Forsaken-Shallots17,16457096670,2

hy5jzle,szo1gx,Its time to start thinking of Covid deaths by year and not over all total its a single point of data that tells us nothing about how were doing Looking at year over year numbers we will be able to start seeing trends and determining what direction were going in No one just looks at the raw total of deaths for other diseases most of them we have no idea anyways If all we ever said about the flu was its killed 20000000000 people or whatever the number would even be then we would constantly just be terrified of it Instead we look at how many cases and deaths it causes per year thats actually useful information the total is only good for people to get freaked out and to cluck their tongues about what a disgrace the response has been,kmo9e,16456521080,34
hy5ve2h,szo1gx,I would say that 1) all of us have suffered through the pandemic in our own way but most of us havent lost someone close so 1M doesnt really hit home 2) most people seem to want to "return to normal" because science and medicine appear to not completely understand the virus and dont have any more answers What are we supposed to do? We are vaccinated we wore masks and we social distanced I have barely left my goddamn house for two years like most of you Seriously what else is there to be done about COVID? Are we supposed to sit and cry all day? Life goes on Its here Its a killer Deal with it,Chad4wick,16456564860,26

hy64xwv,szo1gx,Its definitely not normal its a (hopefully) once in a century tragedy! The question is what else can we do? We locked down and started masking in hopes we drove the virus to extinction That didnt work so we kept that up until we had a vaccine available By this point there is a safe effective vaccine that everyone besides small children can get and theyll hopefully be able to get it in the coming months We even have antivirals to combat the virus Whats the goal now? Lockdowns and masks arent going to stop the virus just buy us time by slowing it down And now we no longer know what were buying time for The flu pandemic never really ended we just stopped treating it as exceptional; covid will be the same as hard as that is to accept,yozaner1324,16456605180,5
hy7g5tb,szo1gx,I dont know what to tell internet people except that for a lot of us COVID changed nearly nothing The jobs didnt let us go home the bills kept coming no checks came in the mail except for those two that everyone mocked for being silly and not even covering one month of rent Unless we wanted to quit and stay home (no unemployment checks for quitters in the US) there was no real choice except to carry on mask up and go to work Its been same crap different day since March 2020 Sometimes you hear about somebodys granny passing away or your coworker goes home with COVID for two weeks while you pick up the slack and then they come back and thats the end of it Theres been a huge mismatch between the online wailing about COVID and the actual experience of living with it and when I say living with it I mean week in and week out in one of the industries where we had higher COVID death rates than the medical people did Line cooks dont take masking very seriously Too high probably think 5G is the virus MOST of the US has been in this boat the entire time The poor Amazon workers didnt get a single day off they got overtime Only on the internet do people seem to live in this weird parallel universe defined by work from home and perpetual COVID measures Its been a hell of a thing to watch people act like thats normal It doesnt matter what I think of any of it I didnt even get to stay home from work for a week while I watched the whole world slam the shutters at once thats how much power I have Call me all the names you want Tell me Im stupid or whatever I have no control over your situation Outside of your bubble its been "normal" this entire time Its been two solid years of everyone carrying on more or less as usual The virus has somehow avoided presenting a face to the public that would make them treat it like a mortal threat the way things like Ebola did and the bosses arent letting anyone off the hook since they can all stay home safe if they wanna Youre the educated middle class not me Youre the ones who should have come up with some sort of way to force whatever it is youre wanting on the world Perpetual work from home? I dont know what you want You had the money resources safety and time to do something about it politically All I know is that everyone has been living in "normal" for a quarter of a decade except for you deaths or no deaths It seems that all your kind can really muster is thinkpieces like this one that tell everyone what they already know and that will fail to convince anyone who doesnt want to know Its just ineffective handwringing except for maybe this writer made a buck from it Maybe Mourn if you want to but theyre obviously going to drag you all back into the offices by your scruffs that or fire you Again its been "normal" since like June 2020 and it looks like its finally your turn at that shit sandwich Whatever the hell this is thats normal now,AttackPug,16456826160,6

hy5y5ch,szo1gx,The problem with this article is the tone it takes and how it tries to use shame to purport its thesis The reality is that the people who need to care a little bit more about COVID death rates are NOT reading Scientific American So who is the audience for this article people who are already vaccinated and boosted and people who probably wear masks to Target but maybe still go out to the movies go to a concert or go out to get a beer with friends theyre the ones responsible for 1000000 COVID deaths? Thats really the narrative we want to go with in 2022 when the Supreme Court struck down Bidens proposal for a national vaccine mandate the GOP refused to pass the Build Back Better bill when it included a ton of social welfare that could have helped bolster long-term changes and the CDC fixed the isolation guidance because a CEO basically said having people stay home while sick was hurting his bottom line? The fact that the author of this article cant even define what he means by "comprehensive pandemic measures" demonstrates that he cares more about sounding smart than actually discussing what factual changes need to be made The fact that the author and people like him do not grasp the fact that preventing more mass death cannot come without higher vaccination rates--which are hardly mentioned in this article at all for some reason--is a sign that many Americans are failing to grasp what is actually helping to prevent deaths both in this country and across the entire world Until more Americans wake up and finally realize what is actually needed were going to continue to see more preventable deaths and shaming people who have already done what they were supposed to do to help other is not going to help anyone,duncan-the-wonderdog,16456576190,5

hy7131i,szo1gx,Not saying this is normal but there will forever be no accurate total death count from Covid reason being no one knows if the death was due to or with Covid-19 My friends dad works for insurance and told me the corrupt system that was going on If paramedics and doctors suspected any Covid-19 related symptoms from their patients or victims in any deathly cause; marking up that the death was Covid related would instantly give them a Covid relief bonus So with that being said nothing is accurate in this country,flashundredyardash,16456749960,1

hy8btrk,szo1gx,COVID is costly in terms of its impact on health and the amount of people it kills but another cost that still rarely finds its way into the public discourse is the psychological cost of lockdowns People are social creatures and social activities are necessary for the proper psychological development of children for the maintenance of mental health for elderly and most importantly to avoid loneliness Dr John Cacioppo who passed in 2018 but was the worlds greatest mind on the topic of loneliness research estimated the cost of loneliness as being equivalent to smoking a pack of cigarettes per day And to clarify he wasnt talking about mere psychological discomfort he was talking about the impact of loneliness on our physiological health and the way loneliness actually causes people to die But when peoples lives are abbreviated by loneliness we dont record loneliness as the cause of death so it never shows up in population health statistics If you talk about COVID and lockdowns but avoid ignore things like compromised mental health addiction depression and loneliness then you are missing the bigger picture,LoudestGuyAtTheParty,16457042200,1
