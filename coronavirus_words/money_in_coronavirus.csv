h7bgqj0,ovpxdj,Uh yeah School starts in 2 weeks and I have no choice but to send my asthmatic kid with scarred lungs from dozens of bouts of bronchitis and pneumonia back into the classroom Because Texas isnt allowing virtual learning and our governor signed an executive order to stop schools from requiring masks So I have no choice but to put him back in a classroom of 25 kids breathing all over each other ( and never washing their hands lets be real) hope his vaccine and his mask are enough because nobody else here is going to have their kids wear them voluntarily So you could use "angry" as an appropriate descriptor You could also say terrified Edit: For all those saying either homeschool or move: I am in the process of rearranging my life (work my own education which can and will obviously be put on hold because it comes way behind my kids wellbeing household expenses etc) to accommodate homeschooling but its not an overnight process Im trying He is too young to stay at home while I go to work every day But I have to work to live and I have to have health insurance to cover my sons meds theyre very expensive As for moving do you have any idea how much that costs? I have picked up and moved out of state before thats how I got here Im not native to Texas It costs thousands of dollars Have you seen the rental/real estate market lately? Its insane If I and my spouse leave our jobs to relocate it would be nearly impossible to find the same income and our rent would increase by as much as double People dont always have the privilege of just picking up and moving somewhere else That costs money and lots of it even to just move to another city and not everyone has that kind of money at their disposal,AncestralFoil247,16278291300,2817

h9yw6au,p9dd93,Heres my take as a member of the Executive team: a huge majority of the staff does not have to come into the office for the company to continue to run smoothly and be successful We announced that "If you want to come back let your direct manager know by X date If not no problem" Were a 500 person company 200 were already remote Of the 300 remaining 70-ish wanted to come back We save money in the long run and have happier staff (as of now) On the flip side there is absolutely less off-the-cuff collaboration That stifles creativity and perhaps innovation but not to the point that its worth mandating Another angle is that remote worker put in much more time since there is no finality to the end I prefer a balance personally I go in Monday - Wednesday EDIT: If youre in Sales and your manager/company is forcing you back in then its time to quit They dont trust you and want to babysit activity,makgeolliandsoju,16296749170,1

Tupelo Hospital (the largest rural hospital in the state) is using their Emergency Room to house patients Thats right there are people on beds in the Emergency Room waiting for a room on the floors to open up Meanwhile UMMC the states only level 1 trauma hospital (in Jackson) has started putting ER patients in a parking garage that is beside the hospital We are all waiting for a major university to just say "We are going back online for the fall" But it is rumored that wont be done until after the last day to withdraw from a college course passes (so they can make money) Translation: Its a shit show down here folks,mississippiwildman,16287760520,904
