h7c31ys,ovpxdj,I had hoped when I got vaccinated it would be the beginning of the end for this virus I was immunized vaccination rates were going up it seemed like things would finally return to normal But its been allowed to stay extant for so long that its had time to mutate Now Im likely going to have to get multiple booster shots just to stay immune because these fuckers are insistent on letting it run rampant Delta is just the beginning Itll mutate again and again as long as antivaxxers deliberately sabotage our herd immunity They are dragging all of us down for their god damned pride Say hello to our new yearly flu everyone,RaynSideways,16278394880,612
h7crnxd,ovpxdj,Ive seen (prob unvaccinated) people complaining that vaccinated people are pissed about needing to wear a mask again when "if I have to wear a mask they should too" the thing is most people who are anti-vaxx are also anti-mask If they didnt wear the mask the first time and they wont get the shot what makes people think theyre going to wear the mask now? Im fully vaccinated and yeah it does piss me off that I might have to wear masks again because of a bunch of idiots that refuse to get the shot so we can all move on from this I went into a store yesterday that had a sign on the door "face masks required for everyone" so I had to go back to my car just to find one as Ive gotten used to not wearing them anymore Well when I went into the store this man and his son were in there not wearing a mask Unless they start really ENFORCING the masks (which I think it would be nice if businesses/whenever else would require proof of vaccination if you have it you dont have to wear a mask if you dont mask on or no entry) we are going to be stuck in this cycle for even longer Lots of people are never going to wear the mask or take the shot willingly Im hoping we eventually get to a vaccine mandate Im just frustrated like lots of people that I did my part wearing a mask for over a year and a half (even after I was fully vaccinated for a while) and then there are people that are just ruining it for us,dirty-little-hearts,16278511820,30

Not wondering why liquor stores and cigarettes are still pushed heavily? Not wondering why mass production of food is slowly poisoning people? Not asking the population to DECENTRALIZE when this would take many mouths out of the system and leave humans to be self sufficient? You are pushing poor people into a system THEY CANNOT SURVIVE IN then shitting on them for taking resources from that system since you think your taxes actually make it to them (which is hilarious) You wanna help people and stop being little drones staring at a screen waiting for the next group of people to shit on?

guldrbp,mrcrm8,>The risk of developing a rare brain clot from Covid-19 is about eight times greater than vaccination with the AstraZeneca - Oxford jab according to a new study This condition where a patient presents abnormally low levels of platelets has been detected alongside CVT in the cases of concern reported to date However Prof Harrison a professor of psychiatry and head of the Translational Neurobiology Group at Oxford University said the research highlight "two important conclusions",Pessimist2020,16184865160,20

gunjngl,mrcrm8,What really fucking annoys me in many of the answers here is *only* comparing blood clot (or rather CVT / "brain clots") risk between Covid and AZ/vaccines Instead of mortality / side effects / long term effects (off both) in general Yes AZ might have a higher risk of CVTs than Pfizer/Biontech and yes it might "only be n times less than the risk of those from Covid"  but Covid can cause death / hospitalization / long term lung or neural damage / "Long Covid" / watever IN ADDITION to blood clots / CVTs And yep even in "the young and healthy" (although with lower probability than in the elderly / other groups at risk  but still quite a bit) Sounds really fucking short-sighted thinking to me Yeah it might be best if everyone would get "the good vaccine" but not everyone can (ask Europe or even better ask "poorer countries) and in really the very most cases even "the bad one" sooner is still much better than getting Covid and dying from blood clots or any of the other many ways it can kill you  or suffering from any of the long term effects On top of that: Getting yourself vaccinated sooner does not only protect your individual sorry corpse it also protects others by reducing potential for further spread (and mutations) and of course protecting those who cannot get vaccinated or whose immune system cannot build as effective an immune response with the vaccine ("vaccine non responders" is the term iirc) What Im saying is: no its not just "AZ clots vs Covid clots vs Biontech clots",spurious_signal,16185227240,1
gunnmtr,mrcrm8,The risk assessment problem you run into is whether youre also eight times more likely to get COVID if you wait for the vaccine Unfortunately theres plenty of people who think theyre just going to sit on the sideline and not get COVID while everyone else gets vaccinated and the case count drops or perhaps a middle path where they wait for the MRNA vaccine Though SUPER anecdotal I was literally taking care of a male patient who received the Pfizer vaccine 2 days ago and had the sinus thrombus I highly suspect that these are much more common and much more benign than we had previously known absent more data to prove a stronger case,hiricinee,16185245950,1

guotxn9,mrcrm8,There was a good article somewhere about how to assess these risks at a more personal level Like the chances of bad outcomes from these things varies with stuff like age and certain pre-existing conditions along with the general community transmission rates of covid So for this headline here you would need to compare also "what are my chances of getting covid *at all*?" against the choice of vaccine If the chances of getting covid are very very low (maybe you live on an island off NZ or something) then it might make sense to avoid AstraZeneca since in your circumstances your chances of having *any* negative outcome from covid are very very very low compared with a very very low chance of negative outcome from AstraZeneca At the public health level different countries have already taken different reactions based on their particular circumstances For instance if you have a fairly dense population and are high income country and have access to something like the BioNTech vaccine then you might take the approach of abandoning AstraZeneca entirely If you are at the other extreme low income poorly developed health infrastructure lots of people long travel times from population centres you probably will press ahead with AstraZeneca and similar vaccines because of its advantages and accept that you will have some small number of complications or deaths because it is far smaller number of deaths from the much slower more expensive difficult roll out of different vaccines,FartHeadTony,16185472640,1
gulu7l0,mrcrm8,Only eight times? Thats worrying because that sorta implies that the AZ vaccine isnt safe due to the fact that the rate of covid causing these clots was extremely high and dangerous 1/8th of really fucking bad is still pretty fucking bad,scwizard,16184958830,-1

The intricacies of the vaccine dangers and complex statistics deserve more credit than just "vaccine sideffects are negligible and therefore should be ignored" When you consider that: - the vaccine does not fully prevent infection and transmission and its in question still just how often it breaks through - the % of the population that cant have the vaccine is very small - the % of them who actually catch the virus is small when the R rate is suppressed and cases are driven down - the % of them who get the virus who couldnt have the vaccine who later are hospitalised or die is also very small (though immune suppressive comorbidities do bring this up a little) - variants are likely to be imported from other countries with higher case rates as opposed to arising domestically - in the case of a vaccine-dodging variant youre back to square one anyway You realise thats its a complex issue with many factors and the balance of probability is not clear or indeed not yet known And yes the vaccine does have rare but relevant and potentially lethal side effects https://amptheguardiancom/world/2021/sep/10/boys-more-at-risk-from-pfizer-jab-side-effect-than-covid-suggests-study For the courts to enforce such a mandate with so many factors and limited and disputed evidence in relation to them it seems a little problematic for them to make a judgement call at the cost of peoples bodily autonomy,meluvyouelontime,16324441090,-3

hc91q7b,pl59ch,Ive been vaccinated but Im absolutely baffled how so many people on Reddit seem to think this is a good idea This is an unprecedented infringement on personal freedom and sets a dangerous limit for what well allow the government to impose on the people Everybody thats eligible should get vaccinated but not because the government has your livelihood at gunpoint Its not far after that they could impose jail time on people who are unvaccinated Just a scary road to go down,DrBoswell,16312340460,8
hc8f8x0,pl59ch,Pros: More vaccinated = fewer hospitals overloaded Cons: more people quitting jobs to avoid the vaccine While the increased vaccination rate should slow the spread and decrease the number of hospitalizations thereby decreasing the unsustainable load on our failing healthcare system this move may also trigger a wave of resignations from the workforce at a time when labor is already in short supply Diregarding for a moment the arguments around freedom of choice and the role of government in our lives the question is: will this mandate have a net positive effect on our society? Does the anticipated decrease in hospitalizations outweigh the potential decrease in the labor force? Consider also the compounding effects of a labor shortage ( yes I know its actually a wage shortage) on the already fractured supply chain Additionally how much benefit will we actually see from this mandate if (when) a vaccine resistant variant of covid begins to dominate? Im asking because I dont know the answer not because Im hinting or suggesting one way or the other I would appreciate thoughts and insights on the subject,SirNicksAlong,16312238980,8
hc92k83,pl59ch,This doesnt solve anything it only promotes more propaganda Even if youre fully vaccinated and do all of the right things you can certainly get infected and be transmissible Its definitely not just the unvaccinated who are spreading this And while were at this the single biggest vax demographic thats reluctant to get the jabs are the African American community (just around 40% have been vaxxed White 50% Asiatic 67%) So he basically just told them all that he was going to take their jobs if they dont submit to the orders of an old white man surrounded by whites and if they dont comply theyll even lose their healthcare Meanwhile they are adding thousands of people into the mix from Afghanistan and lets not forget the practically open southern border where MANY of those caught crossing are testing positive for covid This administration is fuckawful I can tell you something With him creating even more of a divisive stance in this country it will only lead to further division Certainly no one who has been anti vax or even vaccine hesitant is going to listen to this "message" and think you know now Im gonna forget my previous stance and get the jab In fact given recent global events and the lies that have been perpetuated of day that trust in our government locally or globally is at an all time low I predict this will be challenged very quickly with the courts,Posthumos1,16312344230,16

Shooting babies???" bs this is a slippery slope Next youll have government mandated trackers that prevent crime in the name of "the good of the public" And youll have the same people pushing for it that said "vaccine mandates Yeah The good of the public Safety Of course" Where is the line in the name of safety?

The answer is yes The scientific community has spoken and weve had a general consensus about the validity and effectiveness of vaccines for decades Yes with anything medically related there are always risks involved but anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers are being completely disingenuous about those risks Millions and millions of people for decades have taken all sorts of vaccinations and lived side-effect free Vaccines have been mandatory for things like public schools for **decades** Censoring this type of bullshit content isnt an indicator that were living in this liberal dystopian future that a good amount of these anti-vaxxers seem to think were living in Its basically tantamount to removing those videos where idiots were dying from eating those detergent pods Weve 100% reached a point were we know that anti-vaccine beliefs are wrong Enabling people to continue to put out factually misleading content about vaccines is basically like promoting that drinking bleach is good for you This type of censorship whether you believe it or not is 100% for the greater good Anti-vaxxers are wrong If you believe that vaccines are some sort of liberal conspiracy perpetrated by the deep state lizard people you should be in a mental institution I ultimately feel bad for everyone who has fallen pray to bullshit conspiracy theories and are the victims of a poor public education system but now the health and wellbeing of my family and myself are at risk and its time to put an end to these dangerous beliefs Take away their ability to communicate with the masses and allow them to find some niche piece of the internet where they can be in their echo chamber in peace without risking spreading their misinformation to the rest of us,chadstark89,16329392940,-1

hpmkad4,rm4ymn,TIL that care standards vary greatly There are massive discrepancies in standard hospitalization procedures across states and likely internationally It seems that people dont know what they should be asking because COVID isnt respiratory Its a vascular disease caused by antibodies overreacting and attacking a protein in your blood causing clots The virus enters through lung cells so the clots start there At least up until omicron Standard care should almost immediately involve some level of heparin to start and remdesivir In most cases this is enough Worse cases may require dexamethasone to calm the immune system Oxygen should usually be used Most hospitalized should be out of the hospital quickly Monoclonal antibodies worked very well on Delta too But what you dont here is that you shouldnt wait If you have a fever for more than 2 days after testing positive and your chest gets tight look for a monoclonal site If the monitors tell you to go the hospital then you go Keep the hospitals clear dont take medical hooey and understand that time is of the essence,Walternotwalter,16402200280,2

hpnsgrm,rm4ymn,It is far more contagious so if it infects more than 5 times as many people then its more deadly Until we know more banking on the fact it is not as deadly is the same logical fallacy that people were making at the start of the pandemic when they were saying "its only a 2% chance of dying from it" The only certainty from this pandemic is that people seemed destined to learn nothing,Alienturnedhuman,16402469450,2
hpofslc,rm4ymn,Whereas Imperial College London suggests far higher risk Know which one I trust Transmission is also far higher and the virus somewhat immune to vaccines because of its Massively higher infection rates in upper respiratory tracts (lower rates than delta on lower tract - hence lower hospitalization and death) Too many studies underpaying the effects of Omicron if I am twenty times more likely to catch it than delta but only ten times less likely to die if I do my overall odds of dying far worse,Historical_Job_8609,16402647890,2

hplb0ls,rm4ymn,I wanna take a moment to remind everybody that if 1 in 5 of the original number of infected go to the hospital but 10 times as many people get infected that thats WORSE 1/5th times 10 is 2 2 is a bigger number than 1 Omicron is **70** times more infectious than Delta Good fucking luck,Remi_Autor,16402006700,-1
hpl3thq,rm4ymn,This is good But until we know about the postacute effects Ill pass on risking exposure That mild symptom cases are still showing long term effects neurological cardiac pulmonary this is a bigger concern and has been for me even with the relatively low mortality of the virus (still way too high) prior to omicron variants https://wwwnytimescom/2021/03/23/health/long-covid-symptomshtml https://wwwcdcgov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/indexhtml While the omicron may result in fewer deaths it may also placate people into more risky behaviors concerning the virus I just dont want to see a decade pass and then we find we have a large segment of the population incapacitated,robeph,16401977700,0
hpm2cwu,rm4ymn,My personal Logic chain: 1 Delta infections are largely constrained to unvaccinated and non-seroconversion survivors 2 Omicron bypassing both forms of infection immunity but not severe disease immunity Neutralising antibodies vs adaptive immunity 3 Therefore the infected cohort with Omicron is unique in that it contains a high percentage of people with prior exposure and active adaptive immune response Also skewed in that previous infection waves have already removed the more vulnerable from the potential patient pool 4 That cohort needs to be differentiated when looking at Omicron disease severity Even if hospitalisations are lower than other variants were (absent lockdown) potentially going to see a lot of people sick in a very short period of time,GuvnzNZ,16402118750,0
hpkilbg,rm4ymn,Id like to point out that its not clear if this is a property of the variant or a result of having a population seroprevalence of ~80% It may be a bit of both The only way to find out would be to look at unvaccinated people who have never been infected with any variant and examine their hospitalization risk This is a small population at this point But while Ive raised a biologically interesting question the reality is that this wave isnt generating the hospitalization surge that we saw before The hospitalizations need to drive the policies not purple lines on test cards not PCR results with a Ct value of 39 Now I would like everyone to be aware that prior to 2020 hospitals would get overwhelmed with respiratory virus patients *every winter* A lot of these were flu but also RSV metapneumovirus parainfluenzavirus rhinovirus and even endemic coronaviruses So we are going to need to start seriously re-examining our response to this virus We need policy that makes sense for the vaccinated and it may be time to start doing some serious triaging for those who refuse to be vaccinated,MikeGinnyMD,16401891890,1

hpkk2zy,rm4ymn,One interesting caveat - according to the abstract of the pre-print article those hospitalized had roughly the same severity between delta and omicron comparing cases in the same time period whereas comparing delta in an earlier time period hospitalized patients had less severe disease more recently https://wwwmedrxivorg/content/101101/2021122121268116v1 One possible explanation is that unvaccinated/unexposed individuals are still getting really sick but there are less of them now,jpk195,16401898050,1

gzvqvfo,nniy3y,Ima set aside the stupidity of this and simply remind everyone that any mandate your employer wants to implement must be applied to uniformly to everyone for it to be legal &#x200B; For example if your company threatens to fire you for being unvaccinated; they must also fire every unvaccinated full time employee that has been working there for years (**employees whom the company has already invested allot of time and money in training**) If they cherry pick just you then that is discrimination &#x200B; In typical media fashion allot of articles try to place shift the blame onto the individual as if claiming "If YOU dont get the vaccine YOU will face the consequences of not being allowed to work"; when in really the language of these laws is tailored to the employers choice not the employee and should instead be reported as "If WE want to hinder our hiring pool to only vaccinated people we will" **You (the individual employee) are not choosing to be unemployed for not being vaccinated your boss is choosing to fire you** So no need to worry about whether they can or cant mandate this They wont do it because it will for certain cause a labor shortage to them and potentially a discrimination lawsuit if they use it as a reason to fire only the employees they dont like &#x200B; ps: if youre going to post the dumbass response of "many employers already mandate it hurr hurr hurr"; please enlighten us and list specifically which ones Yea Yea Yea you read some article saying that companies are going to do it Name then tell us specifically which companies are right now mandating the vaccine and have fired or are otherwise threatening to fire unvaccinated employees,AbortedBaconFetus,16223037430,3

gzvm272,nniy3y,I work for a hospital system and we have been discussing this from the very beginning This guidance from the EEOC makes mandates possible for employers to require the vaccine It removes the legal challenge hurdles that employees could bring if an employer mandates a vaccine with an emergency approval from the FDA (which isnt full drug authorization and not fully tested) However because of the number of vaccinations in the US Pfizer is in process of requesting full FDA authorization By the EEOC making this action it ramps up the timeline making it possible for employers to take action now instead of 3-4 months later this summer/fall when we may see increases I infection rates TLDR - this moves up the timeline for employers to make vaccinations mandatory improving vaccination rates and protecting more people especially those who cannot get the vaccine (immuno-compromised and those under 12),tumbleweedcowboy,16223012420,1
gzw0xq0,nniy3y,Not necessarily employers but heres a fun read about this type of stuff Real Life Example: Massachusetts Mandates A Vaccine In Jacobson v Massachusetts (1905) Mr Jacobsen refused to obey a law requiring that everyone in Cambridge receive a smallpox vaccination At the time a smallpox epidemic was raging Jacobson faced a fine or imprisonment if he failed to take the vaccine Jacobsen argued that forcing him to get the vaccine violated his fundamental liberty which included freedom to control his own body The State argued that the health risk was urgent that widespread vaccination was needed to protect everyone against smallpox and that any harm to individual liberty was a price worth paying given the severe threat of smallpox The Supreme Court acknowledged that both sides had a point On one hand the Court noted that "when faced with a society-threatening epidemic a state may implement emergency measures that curtail constitutional rights so long as the measures have at least some "real or substantial relation" to the public health crisis "On the other hand the Court recognized Jacobsens argument and agreed that the vaccine order did impact liberty and personal freedom The court cautioned that "a law purporting to protect public health may nevertheless be invalid if it "has no real or substantial relation to those objects or is beyond all question a plain palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law" In short while the court balanced the two competing concernsliberty and public safetythe court came down squarely in favor of public safety holding the vaccine order was valid given the seriousness of the threat The Court said that "the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States does not import an absolute right in each person to be at all times and in all circumstances wholly freed from restraint" But the Court also warned that any if a law goes too far in restricting liberty if the law is in place for too long or reaches too far or if the goal of the law can be achieved by less invasive measures then the court may well strike down the law,LazyKidd420,16223088990,1

Cant you still transmit and contract Covid even if you are vaccinated? You might just not see any symptoms or very little But you are still infected and can infect The virus is still replicating if you are vaccinated which means evolution is still happening Maybe there is some argument to be made that unvaccinated infected people are causing more evolution and if that is the case then why not make that argument instead Saying things like this just completely ruins your credibility,indiez,16311245910,1

If actually walking behind people is your way to know they are productive--Id say its time to work on your business processes and get better at project management The ONLY thing Ill miss is a good whiteboard session in person I hate Zoom video its uncanny valley x4 I minimize the thing unless someone is screen sharing Thankfully 95% of our Zoom meetings are audio only,ZenZulu,16296457000,602
h9x77s3,p9dd93,Im managing a small team and most of us like WFH No problem there But there are some older upper-level management guys who just dont like the whole thing Feels like loss of control and so on So theyre bandying around percentages like post corona you have to be in the office 60% of your time and so on So I asked why 60? In an earlier proposal it was 40 why now 60? No one can explain - its all just emotion So my manager and I kept some pressure on it and now silently its gone to 50% in the newest proposal Still no explanation as to where that percentage comes from My guess is that over time the market will sort it out Organizations that request too many office hours might have difficulty attracting or retaining talent as other organizations might offer better WFH arrangments In due time therefore it is my guess that most organizations will align to a similar WFH structure,SeredW,16296479230,26

h9x060u,p9dd93,Well I started going back to the office about six weeks ago and have been there basically full time for the past three weeks due to a critical staff member being let go As soon as I get her replacement up and running I am going to go back to nearly full time WFH I will be informing my employer of this not asking And yeah Im willing to back it up with a two-week notice Theres so many reasons Delta being the first one of course and also although it may seem contradictory the imposition of an indoor mask mandate in my state (rather just stay home alone than walk around with giant piece of cloth plastered over my face) Theres the fact that our downtown area is almost entirely deserted except for the homeless addicts and mentally ill and I dont feel safe even walking to and from the bus stop And then theres this - that all of the peace Id gained working from home for 16 months all of the bad habits Id shed (among other things I hadnt had a drink in months before I started back at the office and now I"m regularly consuming at least a couple of bottles of wine a week) all of the reliably good sleep all of the feeling of being centered and present in my life - every bit of that is gone and after only a few weeks back Im so burned out I fear it would take a three month vacation just to get me back where I was at the start of summer Employers are absolutely clueless about the toll office life takes on every other aspect of our existence They should not be surprised that people dont want to go back to the way things were because they way things were was something we never should have tolerated in the first place,kat2211,16296448020,106

h9yjt68,p9dd93,I dont want to go into the office full-time but theres definitely aspects of fully working from home that I struggle with: * For whatever reason my workplace is hyper-connected Managers are now comfortable booking meetings at 6-7am or 6-7pm and have little respect for a lunch hour like they used to When you complain about it nobody cares "Just wake up earlier" they say or "just stay on for an extra two hours" they say "Its a priority so it has to get done" they say although if it really was a priority wouldnt it be worth addressing in core business hours? We used to limit meeting times to 9:30am to 3:30pm to respect everyones start and end times but now thats all out the window * People know you cant travel anywhere and are probably nearby if you have vacation time This has led to what I consider a toxic expectation that youre always around unless you explicitly tell people youre truly unavailable between these certain hours on your damn vacation Two of the managers who took vacations this summer still came online for meetings I guess maybe its admirable in the eyes of some but IMO is there nothing better to do? Read a book or go cook a meal for your kids Thats what Id be doing * I talk with my hands a lot Being confined to a tiny Zoom meeting box that filters out my arms feels stifling to me * Im not as fast on the unmute button as some people and it feels like I can never get a word in because of it Not everyone has cameras on or is paying attention to the cameras so they dont really pick up on social cues that someone is about to speak Using the "raise hand" function is nice in theory but few respect it One of my best skills in meetings was not only doing that but also respecting the quieter people and creating venues for them to speak Now its just an unmute race and Im always losing * I struggle to stay focused in Zoom meetings Its not that Im playing games or checking e-mails Even if I turn on my camera full-screen my monitor for the meeting to block out all distractions and try my best to stay focused I completely zone out hearing voices of people in various volumes and quality blasted directly into my ear via headphones * I cant stand to be in my home office after work I used to love gaming here but now I just want nothing to do with it The whole room is associated with work and I dont want to step foot in it after I log off As a programmer I used to like coming in here putting on some movies and experimenting with new tech but now it seems like a chore Its like my company now owns part of my house I still consider myself lucky that I dont have to work out of my bedroom though Is this just my company or are other people experiencing this too? I dont even know if all of these are related to working from home or not but they definitely werent problems at my company before we moved to a fully WFH environment Its strange too because we were a hybrid setup before with a mix of full remote people and people across multiple offices who wouldnt come in every day and things *seemed* fine,bluetista1988,16296690980,14

h9x38c3,p9dd93,Ive been managing a remote engineering team for about 15 years- long long before Covid After managing onsite teams for about 15 before that It is IMHO night and day more difficult to manage the remote team And IMHO most of the issues solved by remote work are actually issues with horrible open offices and long commutes- not anything specifically to do with remote vs onsite work Some thoughts from doing this for over a decade: * 25% of people will be productive no matter where they are 25% will be problematic no matter where they are 50% of people work better with some form of office infrastructure Everyone thinks they are in that first 25% * Dealing with HR issues is much much more problematic with remote employees Try dealing with terming someone with a substance abuse problem when you never get to see them in person and dont have an attendance record to support your HR case * Peoples home environments are often horribly full of distractions People put up with this during Covid because there were no other alternatives- but having someones toddler running around screaming during meetings is an issue A good WFH environment will have a dedicated home office and a good WFH employee will have uninterrupted time in that office- but most dont have their home workspaces set up properly * Peoples WFH performance deteriorates over time- especially over many years Especially with employees with kids who only one parent is WFH Suddenly you realize that you are working around an employee who has to pick up the kids from school every day during work hours- folks start building lives/schedules around being able to disappear for a couple hours a day * There are simply no good current tech substitutes for a classic conference room whiteboard session Doing this remotely sucks All of that can be managed with appropriate focus/tools/etc But it adds substantially to the managerial effort required I think it seemed to work during Covid better than it would have because many tech firms paused or slowed down their project work during that period (I know all of my clients basically shelved most of the project deliverables last/this year and we are just now getting back to regular project planning cycles) Well see maybe Ill be wrong and the tech has progressed to the point where this will work I think the norm is going to become hybrid plans where folks are in the office a couple days a week but cant fully live anywhere they want,jakdak,16296461930,43

h9zjtur,p9dd93,I have lifelong friendships and business references from working with people in an office It sounds great maybe if you are young and still in touch with school/university people for your social life Even having offices move to WFH seems great because all your coworkers are in the same area and you already have closer bonds from knowing them in-person so even over video it seems a bit more fun Well over time workers will come and go and fewer and fewer new hires will be "local" to you Though you will have social "zoom meetings" it just wont have the same impact For the past 6 years Ive worked either remotely or with a large part of the team being remote so COVID wasnt the start of this for me As Ive noticed almost nobody keeps in touch after changing jobs from these remote teams Apart from perhaps a reference for a job application there is little to zero contact No long term friendships no long term anything Sure sometimes when someone would move to a new job you might chat quite a bit talk about things but usually those fizzle to zero rather quickly However I have plenty of friends held for decades gained from working together in person We still go out to hang talk over voice and chat play online and in-person games grab some drinks or see a show Those remote people on the "Chicago Team" of a job from five years ago I struggle to remember their names now Long term this will probably damage cities and urban centers Think the rise of the automobile and massive efficient highways created suburban sprawl?

Welcome to your home your prison I cant wait for the downvotes here I can almost smell them Of course some of what I am saying might not completely come to be but without a doubt its a strong possibility I guarantee this first taste of 100% remote working seems great now but long term the unintended consequences have not been fully considered And by the time those consequences are more strongly realized it would probably be impossible to go back to the office or at least a long uphill battle,RedditRage,16296866320,2

h9yw6au,p9dd93,Heres my take as a member of the Executive team: a huge majority of the staff does not have to come into the office for the company to continue to run smoothly and be successful We announced that "If you want to come back let your direct manager know by X date If not no problem" Were a 500 person company 200 were already remote Of the 300 remaining 70-ish wanted to come back We save money in the long run and have happier staff (as of now) On the flip side there is absolutely less off-the-cuff collaboration That stifles creativity and perhaps innovation but not to the point that its worth mandating Another angle is that remote worker put in much more time since there is no finality to the end I prefer a balance personally I go in Monday - Wednesday EDIT: If youre in Sales and your manager/company is forcing you back in then its time to quit They dont trust you and want to babysit activity,makgeolliandsoju,16296749170,1

ha04grb,p9dd93,This is something I suggested to my company in the UK: Hi folks Ive given some consideration to this and would like to suggest the below rules to satisfy a flexible work offering to the SD: I have based this on: 23 SD staff (8x 24/7 engineers 15x Core shift) Image Image Image Each engineer must come in 40% of their time Each day there must be at least 5 people physically on rotad shift Each day there must be no more than 10 engineer on schedule We split the WFH days in any given week between a choice of Monday+Tuesday or Thursday+Friday This grants opportunity of "extended weekend feeling" to all Q: Why 40% submission to physical occupation? A: TeamLead stated Service Desk requires an obligatory 15% physical office presence on any working day Q: How does this impact skill availability? A: It doesnt this is based purely on resource as we have availability across core teams in the working week On average we will have 8 engineers physically within the office space Q: How this is managed? A: Either by a scheduling app/portal where engineers self-sign up (first come first serve) and commit to fulfilling their weekly hours or assigned by TLs Q: How does this solution address 24/7 flexibility? A: Whilst 24/7 day shift must attend the office space 24/7 night shift fulfil duties from home Any 24/7 day shift falling on a weekend is fulfilled from home This is open to your adjustments or leave as is in the pot for discussion and practical application for the business Thanks" Glad to say this has now been adopted  Before COVID happened my company was on target to turn 200m so they purchased a new HQ for 15m We are an IT Managed Service Provider The company had plans to go global looking for offices in the USA They signed the contract grace period passed and then COVID happened They were unable to back out of the deal and have since been working within regulations of UK lockdowns and government guidance to continue with the new head office plan We have lost only 1 employee during this pandemic and that was after he contracted Covid after major surgery Work load has increased the employment demand at our company due to demand from clients working remotely and other IT projects Due to Covid theyve put the expansion on the back burner for now and are cautiously monitoring markets and of course Covid itself They still want to expand to the US Fingers crossed!  As we have hospitals and government clients for technical support we were actually classed as support workers and got full 80% furlough offered but we didnt need to take it Covid has just sped up the work from home culture and those that do not change their ways are set to lose good employees Mental health has been cited as one of the major drivers with a large majority of workers being effected I personally have been wfh social distancing and wearing a mask in public since 2019 when my wife started chemotherapy after a mastectomy So this has been the norm for us long before Covid came along I do think there is a need for a physical space a lot of clients say the office is a place to separate home and work life Ive never had this as an issue in fact I am blessed that I have seen my son grow up since his birth in 2019 I get to spend time playing with him look after my wife and be home "on time" or work late if I want to An hour here and there longer doesnt kill me in fact I believe I start earlier and finish on time or happy to work later I think sales people need that physical connection and banter with their colleagues its the nature of that beast I know from a lot of clients and other companies I interviewed for that WFH was a massive positive to performance and output but over time people have got complacent or lazy and now efficiency is actually on the back slide WFH is definitely here to stay to what degree and capacity offered is another thing Ps feel free to use my wfh flexible working plan ,PrimarisBA,16296996010,1

ha2d7eg,p9dd93,Im in IT and everything I do can be done remotely On those ultra-rare occasions a server doesnt come back up or theres something that requires a brief on-site I have coworkers in the Austin area who gladly volunteer to go to the office I live 86 miles from the office in San Antonio You gain so much from working from home and it enriches your life and finances Financially I reallocated my previous vehicle expenses towards building a maintenance account for the car and now am placing small amounts away for whenever the car needs replacement which wont be soon as its a 7 year-old car with only 40k on the odometer What frightens me is that so many retirement accounts and other investments are using REITs and if holding companies start to go under due to unleased office space that may drive companies to migrate back into offices again That movement and how rapidly it is migrated to would depend on the market overall REITs are not always the safe haven theyve been portrayed as from some insiders Ive spoken to There is also much anxiety with middle-management over not being able to manage what you dont see While remote monitoring software adoption is increasing these middle managers arent the least bit tech-savvy and such applications intimidate the hell out of them Thus middle managers are paranoid their jobs are next on the chopping block something I am happy to see as theyve often been excluded from previous workforce culls At the end of the day the companys bottom line is all that counts If theyre saving tons of cash from not having to lease so much office space and middle management is suddenly redundant theres even more opportunity for profit by cutting them They were never essential to begin with and always an albatross in my opinion With work from home I never have to worry about leaving by x time to avoid traffic which in Austin is impossible If I have to work overtime or do something after hours its super-easy For those in the medical field I empathize with you greatly not mention deeply respect your daily efforts even when the public behaves like an ass My wife is a CRNA and doesnt have the luxury I do My fervent hope is that work from home doesnt come to an end and that weve seen the birth of a new form of work become permanent,pguschin,16297447470,1

h3yaqxw,ocwhp4,Im glad this is here because I didnt want to post and I cant So here is the thing before the pandemic I had asthma an issue I had struggled with all my life and more I constantly got sick starting usually with colds then respiratory infections walking neumona chronic sinus infections all of this before ultimately getting better and slowly starting the same cycle all over again from year to year with varying degrees of severity fluctuating throughout my life After 2020 specifically January or maybe December year previous I had come back home to Oregon because I was chronically ill and unable to eat food I had gone from 220lb to just 147 in two months That issue is still on going I only mention it to make known that I had previously been in a failed physical state as well prior to the outbreak When the outbreak occurred it did so in Hillsboro Oregon the city we lived in at the time and we had already been sick all of us with respiratory issues Something were all well familiar with and more and equipped to deal with it since it runs in the family It passed like nothing for my family but I as per usual began my long cycle starting with the initial cold step; however when it came to the respiratory infection step everything changed In the past my mucus at this point would be thick heavy and brown and it would make it extremely difficult and painful for me to remove it by force namely deliberately coughing it all up over and over again until all of it for that day was gone and then sleep rinse repeat until fully recovered people I am poor as SHIT! When its your whole Life! You find a way Anyways I got to that step but this time my mucus had changed It was now white like histamine light stringy and sticky This made it near impossible to cough out The only reason my method had worked in the past was because it was near solid when brown and I could use the muscles around my lungs to forcefully eject the solid mass once it had built to a certain level Now as right now it just stays as a light presence in my lungs but at that time I tried wildly to eject it to the point that I may have either dislocated my collar bone documented as having been dislocated as a child or my shoulder I dont know for sure I tried and failed but its ok I was for reasons I wont get into examined against my will at a hospital some time after these events and they cleared me as never having had the corona virus subsequently released from unmentioned hospital Since that time my mucus has not gone back to the way it was and Ive not gotten any colds sinus infections none of it I started gaining my weight back more my muscle is rebuilding with very little effort and I have not changed my diet I eat virtually nothing and I mean that I am daily on a starvation diet My wife currently is trying to follow me she is at 114lb meanwhile eating less than she does I currently am just under 180lb I ate steak two days ago I virtually only eat meat these days Here is what I know Prior to the outbreak I was withering and I had been fighting respiratory issues my whole life despite making more than the usual effort to maintain my health through rigorous diet and exercise which had wained in the last three years leading up due to family a child full time work and marital stress Currently I am demonstrably better No changes to my diet since 2019 which consist of regular daily fasting only drinking milk sometimes mixed with peanut butter and a banana once or twice daily and occasionally red meat and sea life No changes to my family whom I still continue to struggle with daily weighting heavily on my psyche Ive been out of work since 2019 so that has not changed but things overall in my family and my living situation has improved Nevertheless the bigger factory being diet has not changed but my mucus has Im writing this while caring for my eight month old son one of two so spare me some consideration here if youre still reading lol in conclusion I got better after the pandemic and although I was told I had not been infected I believe that I was and I also believe that Ive overall as a life form become stronger as a result Im changing physically and physiologically for my betterment and that makes me genuinely wonder if vaccinating myself against these possible natural dangers is not the wrong way to go? Are we not looking for that key to open the door to the next phase of biological evolution? Or are we just waiting for Elon and machines to make things easy for us?

hmu7m57,r6ejmd,It makes a lot if sense that a virus with time will mutate in something that doesnt kill Its host But I dont wanna to keep my hopes up Thing is we cant get more data without getting people infected and we dont want too many people to get infected because we dont wanna take the risk (also more spread means more potential mutations anyway) Big conundrum,Majukun,16383896300,2
hmwqn6a,r6ejmd,Woop woop woop! Hoping for a more transmissible less lethal form of the virus! Upside anti-vaxxers stop being breeding houses for more lethal variants AND get immunity! Downside anti-vaxxers get COVID and say "See I TOLD YOU it was all media lies!!!" Obviously not everyone who transmits Omicron would have only flu-like symptoms (which are expected this time of year) and there is still concern for hospital overwhelm but if we can ensure carriers are stable and discharge them home to quarantine we just got (partial) immunity into the anti-vaxxers! The opportunity for more lethal mutations in a body that doesnt already have anti-bodies decreases BAM!

hmsmq4x,r6ejmd,Regardless anyones best bet is to probably take the booster and check out again for another 6 months while obviously practicing common sense around others I take back what I said a few days ago about Omicron potentially being the big one for all but it will probably just be the case for those fully unvaccinated and who have trusted in their bodys natural immunity since March 2020 EDIT: 6 months off Covid news I mean It feels as if were reaching the point where its just a game of keeping up with whatever is the most effective vaccine every 6 months or so unless something comes around and messes things up 6 months of course would be nice but its definitely a dream Just simple Covid news not time off lol,Sn1pe,16383664860,-9
hmtmnrx,r6ejmd,Lmao they know little to nothing about the OG covid 19 virus throw in mutations and it is a constant cycle of trying to catch up Alot of knowledge is coming from past experiences with coronaviruses but thats a very basic understanding that doesnt account for adaptations/mutation If they had an actual knowledge of what truly works with preventing or atleast decreasing symptoms we wouldnt be on shot #4 in a years time And before everyone says Im against vaccinations Im not However I will always be skeptical about any type of meds that are authorized for emergency use Time and results over the longterm will determine true effectiveness (And not saying we will but could just as easily find out that THIS vaccination COULD be doing more harm than good to our bodies) Tiny tidbit: my mother tested positive for Covid now 4-5 times hospitalized 3 of those times all in the past year (She has had all shots and boosters) kind of leads me to believe in a lack of effectiveness or I suppose false diagnosis (She is not only one I know just the closest to me that has tested positive and been hospitalized multiple times,Puzzleheaded-Yard891,16383815520,1

Hospitals are full no ICU beds Here in upstate NY we sometimes wait 3 to 4 HOURS outside the hospital with the patient in the ambulance because there are no beds in the ER And while we are waiting we cannot respond to other calls that come in People will die in this scenario from injuries or medical issues that were treatable And that makes me angry Not sure who to blame Government anti-vaxxers anti-maskers businesses that dont enforce rules the list seems endless But watching a patient die in the back of an ambulance 100 feet from the ER doors because there is no capacity to provide care is something I dont wish on anyone,IronScaggs,16413923930,8260

That I believe were performing WORSE right now than we were a year ago I currently have congestion and a cough Ive had it for over a week now; thought it was a cold but its not going away I decided "I should probably get tested" I found a take-home test for $15 at the grocery store - used it and it came up negative I figured "maybe I should get a professional consult just to make sure" Guess what? minimal 1 week wait time for any place within 50 miles of me Drive-through tests? "Oh no thats for asymptomatic only you have to go to the regular places" All appointments full Get an at-home test? Sold out everywhere Order one online?

I shouldnt be this stunned but yet I cant believe how mismanaged all of this was even with a seemingly "competent" Government back in command Did they all collectively get-together and just say "fuck it business as usual" and forgot to announce that? **EDIT**: Just an FYI I live in Central New York around the Syracuse area and things are generally managed well (we get a LOT of snow and its usually plowed within a reasonable amount of time so they know how to handle these types of issues) The fact that its this bad here makes me feel bad for the States/Counties that REALLY didnt lift a finger and try to help Our local Government officials are doing what they can but its nowhere near enough to stem the tide of Omicron Nobody was prepared and nobody TRIED to get prepared Complete failures all-around,VheloGrace,16413960850,560

hrdbk3d,rwn229,Im not sure what to make of these numbers Deaths are less than half the last wave Check the data for yourself HALF https://wwwnytimescom/interactive/2021/us/massachusetts-covid-caseshtml Now Im sure ICUs are preventing more deaths than they did last year but cases are double their peak yet half the deaths? Vaccines are working So honestly the death data leads me to believe there are waaaaay less people in the ICU vs last year Not sure Im buying these drama headlines or why the hospitals are struggling this year vs last And Mass general on their own website stated they have ICU capacity as of 12/24 https://datargjcom/covid-19-hospital-capacity/facility/massachusetts-general-hospital/220071/ Now Im sure the holiday surge probably pushed those numbers up but look at last year the same time frame They had 157 ICU beds last Christmas They now have 147 Theyve lost 9% of their beds (probably due to staff having Covid) But that isnt exactly a crisis and they still appear to have capacity But just saying do the research for yourself and come to your own conclusions Then again its Reddit and no one gives a $&@% A sensationalistic headline gets way more clicks even if the article is offering alternative facts and people have an attention span of an ant So who cares right? Im gonna save this mass general link so I can check the data for next week Not reaching a conclusion yet but based on this data Im leaning towards "yes this is a problem but its not the end of the world crisis the internet makes you believe" EDIT: and honestly the EMT post below was asking who to blame? Look at the Mass General link and how much capacity they had last Nov they over shot offering 210+ beds Operating at half capacity is not profitable for the hospital so it makes sense they would scale down and run at capacity If youre looking for someone to blame clearly this is hospital managements problem Theyve underestimated the demand for ICU beds and werent able to scale up fast enough Granted this is an extremely difficult thing to predict Who knew right? But this in essence is where the problem lies The inability of hospitals to accurately predict the demand for ICU beds 2 months ahead and scale capacity accordingly,888Kraken888,16413995890,27

gwja6gl,n2hns4,**Michigan is now hospitalizing more people under 40 than those over 80 for COVID-19** Dr Stacey Sensor says her 18-year-old son a high school senior is "one of the healthiest people I know" "He works out every single day at five oclock in the morning" said Sensor a Gaylord physician "He takes all these supplements He only eats healthy And he got COVID at the gym "He was quite sick for about eight days" she said "So Im telling you that it doesnt matter what supplements you take what your age is Even in the healthiest individual they still can get it and they can still become very sick and then the effects can be there for quite some time" Its a cautionary tale she said for people who see COVID-19 as a serious health threat for the elderly but a much more benign illness for younger healthier people In fact Michigans current coronavirus surge has turned that assumption on its head: Last week the state was averaging more hospital admissions for COVID patients under 40 than patients age 80 or older The former was about 78 a day compared to 50 for the latter according to data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services The biggest reason for the demographic shift experts say: The difference in vaccination rates About 74% of Michigan residents age 70 and older have gotten at least one dose of vaccine and two-thirds are fully vaccinated For those 16 to 49 the numbers are 36% who have gotten one dose and 23% fully immunized; there is no vaccine authorized for children under 16 Also contributing to the surge of virus among young people is the spread of variants that are both more contagious and more lethal; the tendency of many younger adults to disregard COVID-19 guidelines and the fact that schools have reopened "Its definitely become more of a young person disease now probably because they havent been vaccinated and theyve been more likely than older folks to go out and about be in close contact with others and go to gatherings" said Dr Mark Hamed a physician who is medical director for Huron Lapeer Sanilac Tuscola Alcona Iosco Ogemaw and Oscoda counties The numbers bear that out In the first year of the pandemic Michigan residents age 60 and older accounted for 23% of cases; its now 13% Conversely those under age 20 accounted for 13% of cases during the first 12 months of the pandemic; its now 25% The chart below shows the April case numbers by age group compared to the monthly average through March 2021 as well as compared to December 2020 during the fall surge [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/WNTiwqVd1gGfPM09p2D0qzVgFZY=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/VQGMMSPTZNGADOVJQPKGAWILMQPNG) In theory thats actually a welcomed shift from the standpoint that old age is easily the biggest risk factor for being hospitalized or dying of COVID-19 But experts have been taken aback by the spike in COVID-19 hospitalizations among younger adults and children Compared to the height of the fall surge in early December Michigans average daily hospitalization admissions for COVID-19 are up 33% for those age 18 to 29 58% for thirty-somethings and 64% for those in their 40s Meanwhile hospitalizations for those age 80 and older are down 60% compared to December [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/86v1e7Apdm4-zWbHd-9Q7X4rAh0=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/RPEUG3IW5JGXTF6HQYL2RBK67Upng) "Its like you take what we were seeing before and shift it down by one or two decades" said Dr Joel Fishbain an infectious disease specialist for Beaumont Hospital in Grosse Pointe "Weve got 20-year-olds who are getting admitted and 30-year-olds requiring oxygen which we never saw before and needing as much treatment as we can give them Weve got 40- and 50-year-olds ending up on ventilators" Pediatric cases also are up Last week the state was averaging almost 10 hospital admissions a day among pediatric patients with COVID-19 triple the number in mid-February Deaths among children and younger adults have spiked too In the first 13 months of the pandemic there were six deaths among children ages 10 to 19 In the past month four deaths were reported Another 65 deaths were reported in April for 20- and 30-somethings quadruple the monthly average The chart below compares April deaths to the monthly average through March 2021 as well as to confirmed COVID deaths in December The numbers show how deaths among seniors plummeted in April compared to December as a result of vaccinations while coronavirus variants spiked deaths among unvaccinated people under age 50 [Image](https://wwwmlivecom/resizer/caQyJGE9C2BiswUM2ThU22RJumk=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1imagesarcpublishingcom/advancelocal/ZXCIGC7VWZCN7H65ULFSFE4GPIPNG) Deaths and hospitalizations arent the only concern While most COVID patients under age 50 "dont get severely ill there are a growing number of people who have long-haul COVID symptoms" said Dr Liam Sullivan an infectious disease specialists with Spectrum Health in Grand Rapids "They have problems with smelling with taste with concentration with memory with fatigue with night sweats "So even though they had a mild illness the first time around theyre still dealing with these things month and months later and thats not something you want to deal with when youre 25 or 35" he said "Of course you dont want to deal with it at any age but especially when youre in the prime of your life" And for women the research is growing on the dangers of COVID-19 during pregnancy Dr Kurt Wharton an Oakland County obstetrician currently has four pregnant patients in intensive care units battling COVID-19 All four are "fighting for their lives" said Wharton who works at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak While COVID-19-related deaths among pregnant women remain very rare Wharton and others say the evidence is growing that coronavirus during pregnancy can put a woman at a much higher risk of preterm birth preeclampsia and admission to the ICU and/or intubation especially if the woman has pre-existing conditions such as high blood pressure obesity diabetes or heart disease Evidence growing on COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy: Virus is dangerous; the shots are not Doctors offer several theories on why more younger people are getting significantly ill with COVID-19 in the current surge One is the spread of variants which are both more contagious and more lethal The variants are "stickier" Hamed said which means it takes less exposure to make someone severely ill or even symptomatic Wharton noted the same pattern happened during the 1918 influenza pandemic The initial surge in the spring of 1918 primarily impacted the elderly and babies But the virus mutated and came roaring back in the fall of 1918 and its primary victims during that surge were younger adults "History is repeating itself" Wharton said Another issue suggests Hamed and others: More unvaccinated people are gathering in groups without masks That increases the risk of exposure to a higher viral load which has been associated with more severe disease "The best mask you wear the less viral load you inhale" Wharton said On top that many schools have reopened and children and younger adults in particular are resuming their pre-pandemic social lives "You can see it" Wharton said "Younger people are all out in groups again walking down sidewalks shopping going to restaurants and bars together They just think theyre invulnerable" The good news is that COVID-19 vaccinations have proven "wildly successful" in significantly reducing the chances of getting the virus and spreading to others Sullivan said And just as vaccinations have blunted spread of the virus among senior citizens the spread of COVID among younger adults can be stymied through immunization shots Vaccination programs "really need to target the younger people right now" Sensor said "Theyre the ones who are getting sick Weve done a really good job of vaccinating our older population but to really move forward and get out of this pandemic we really need our younger people to step up to the plate and get the vaccine to protect themselves and protect their families",itsdr00,16198732450,154

h9pnz04,p8e6s6,"The Food and Drug Administration is pushing to approve Pfizer-BioNTechs two-dose Covid-19 vaccine on Monday further expediting an earlier timeline for licensing the shot according to people familiar with the agencys planning Regulators were working to finish the process by Friday but were still working through a substantial amount of paperwork and negotiation with the company The people familiar with the planning who were not authorized to speak publicly about it cautioned that the approval might slide beyond Monday if some components of the review need more time An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment The agency had recently set an unofficial deadline for approval of around Labor Day The approval is expected to pave the way for a series of vaccination requirements by public and private organizations who were awaiting firmer regulatory backing before implementing mandates Federal and state health officials are also hoping that an approved vaccine will draw interest from some Americans who have been hesitant to take one that was only authorized for emergency use a phenomenon suggested by recent polling Some universities and hospitals are expected to mandate inoculation once a vaccine is fully approved The Pentagon earlier this month said it plans to make Covid vaccinations mandatory for the countrys 13 million active-duty troops "no later" than the middle of next month or sooner if the FDA acts earlier The timing of the approval could result in an uncomfortable messaging problem for the Biden administration which on Wednesday announced that fully vaccinated people should prepare to get booster shots eight months after they received second doses Approving the vaccine and encouraging boosters at the same time may suggest to some that the vaccine as licensed is inadequate without an extra shot The FDA last week updated its authorizations of Pfizer-BioNTechs and Modernas vaccine to allow third doses for some immunocompromised people a decision backed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Regulators are still reviewing Modernas application for full approval for its coronavirus vaccine and a decision could come at least several weeks after the one for Pfizer-BioNTech",urbanpencil,16294944330,203

gwysdn4,n4uoij,Probably going to be downvoted for saying this but here are my reasons for being in the "unlikely" camp I want to get it the vaccine so Im curious if anyone can actually refute some of these points: Restrictions have become a moral question with easing restrictions being seen as evil and more restrictions good Seeing peoples reactions to people in this thread saying they want restrictions eased is proof of that Theres no point to getting vaccinated if well have to wear masks attend online school and have businesses shut down/otherwise crippled indefinitely The side effects and no Im not talking about the fringe cases of people dying etc I trust it enough that Im not worried about them Theres just no time in my world to feel like I got hit by an electric streetcar for upwards of a week Im a college student and accommodations made to people down for the count from the immediate side effects highly depend on the professor There will be no accommodations for me Reduced availability from the J&J freeze I had originally intended to take the J&J vaccine to minimize the effect of the previous point but after the freeze it became and continues to be incredibly difficult in my area to get Cost This is a simple one but there are likely to be negative financial repercussions for getting it ie having to pay for it Lack of a positive incentive As a college student I didnt receive any stimulus checks that went out earlier this and last year There might be a reason to get it if there was an incentive to doing so in a similar manner I would actually receive but I see no movement on that The effectiveness time per vaccine Ive heard estimates putting the time of effectiveness as low as 3-6 months depending on the variant Given all these other factors the fact that I would have to take this 4x a year in perpetuity makes this sound about as futile as it gets Those are the big ones and I dont really see any of them changing any time soon at least in my area Open to new information/having my mind changed I really do see the positives in getting it but until these roadblocks are gone it remains unlikely I will,BTSInDarkness,16201726700,4

hdlacvc,prsbj3,The headlines are skewing this VERY positively This is actually not very reassuring data in terms of likelihood getting the vaccine approved There wasnt enough COVID observed particularly severe illness/hospitalization to determine clinical efficacy which is why they had to use antibody response as a surrogate endpoint Antibody levels are not a very good measure of real world clinical efficacy and its unclear what they mean and how much benefit they actually confer particularly in children The FDA may have a hard time issuing the EUA in the coming weeks with the data we have now and I wouldnt at all be surprised if they ask for more After all EUA stands for **Emergency** Use Authorization and the virus hardly qualifies as an emergency in children based on this data Id love to argue that its an emergency in adults and vaccinating kids would help but in general we have a real tough time approving interventions in kids without evidence of much direct benefit to them particularly under EUA I know Im gonna get downvoted for this but Im a resident pediatrician and I truly wanted this to work more than anyone Disappointed with how the data shook out At the same time I wouldnt want anything to be approved without CLEAR evidence that the benefit outweighs the risk and its hard to say we have enough data to determine that at this time,chocoholicsoxfan,16321461530,50

gufn854,mpzwzj,US still seeing over 20-30 times the daily deaths and cases compared to the UK is a bit weird (all schools reopened in UK for three weeks before Easter) UK did start with Pfizer for the eldest patients in early December but then early January had a huge rollout of AZ vaccine with a change of strategy to 1-shot prioritisation (so delaying second shot to 12 weeks) And so far it seems to have worked amazingly well There are the 1 in a million fatal blood clot reports in UK from AZ too but the early hysteria about anaphylactic reactions to the Pfizer doses has disappeared for some reason (its much more common than blood clots) (They let you leave the vaccination room straight away after AZ jab with Pfizer you have to wait at 15-30 mins before you are allowed to leave because of this issue),escherbach,16183605030,3

gufb9d0,mpzwzj,Although I understand the concern its very possible this is a statistically normal phenomenon Heres some math to consider: The incidence of clots in women on oral contraceptives is 03%-1% over 10 years There are about 65 million women age 18-50 in the US About 14% are on the pill That means at the high end of the range you could expect 24 women per day could get a clot (ie 9000000\*001/3650 = 24) If we assume the distribution of the JnJ vaccine wasnt demographically biased (which may not be the case but the data on it should be available) then 7000000\*65000000/330000000\*014 = 193000 were women age 18-48 on oral contraceptives This is about 214% of all women in that demographic So over the course of a month you would expect those women to be responsible for 00214\*24\*30 = 154 clots at the high end of the normal risk range and 46 at the low end of the range The actual reported number was 6 Even assuming 50% reporting this is well within the normal range And that doesnt even account for pregnant women who also have an increased risk of clots Running the numbers for 54 million pregnant women (at any given time) each with a 01% chance of developing a clot Therefore on any given day you could expect 5400000\*0001/280 = 193 pregnant women to experience a clot or 580 in the course of a month Now granted pregnant women may have been less likely to get the vaccine (although its reportedly safe during pregnancy) BUT lets ignore that potential bias for a minute and assume that 5400000/330000000\*7000000 = 115000 pregnant women got the vaccine in the last month Those women would be responsible for 115000/5400000\*580 = 124 additional clots over the course of that month So under totally regular circumstances it wouldnt be abnormal for 27 out of the 3500000 women in question to get a clot in a given month This leaves a lot of room for the potential effect of biases in these stats Its obviously critical to verify all this though so I understand why the CDC would want to shut things down while they delve into the data Hindsight is 20/20 but I would say its really not surprising this was the main adverse event that was reported Women age 18-48 have a very very low rate of sudden unexpected mortality due to an adverse clinical event Even though the survival rate for a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is 95% that 5% is a significant number for individuals who are otherwise totally healthy Id be willing to bet its one of the top sudden physiological causes of mortality in the demographic in question Glancing at the data for the AstraZeneca vaccine it seems very similar Im curious -- have no patients who got the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines experienced clots?

I would assume I have little or nothing to worry about although I guess I should be more mindful of any symptoms just in case It does not hurt to be diligent and keep an eye out for myself I really dont know what to make of all this I "guess" being vaccinated was still the right choice I would argue the alternative could have been worse I made an informed choice with the information I had which is really all anyone could do right?! ,Linux-Is-Best,16183299540,2

gue5f9l,mpzwzj,https://healthscimcmasterca/news-events/news/news-article/2021/03/22/mcmaster-scientist-resolves-covid-19-clot-question If the clotting is caused by the immune response (antibodies and platelets) wont it stand to reason that the patient could be given blood thinners on a temporary basis? I think the antibodies go away after a period of time (how long?) and then its the remaining T-Cells that help with an immune response during the next exposure? So presumably there would be no need to be on blood thinners permanently? Although what confuses me is this: Once we go back to normal and people have been vaccinated isnt the whole point that their body will ramp up and make a ton of antibodies real quick in response to exposure to the actual virus? Does this mean there is a risk of blood clotting due to viral exposure for those who have been vaccinated regardless of the vaccine? I need someone who understands immunology better than me to explain all this Does it seem like those who are having the severe reaction to the vaccine are the same folks who would have had a crazy immune system overreaction to the virus? What is it about some peoples immune systems? It is kind of scary to think that were trying to vaccinate for a virus where the main cause of virulence is it wrecks havoc on the immune system,Calendar_Girl,16183348630,1

Edit Update: I am sorry to hear that you are sick for those who have revealed that Im interested in learning if your bosses are okay with giving you the time you need to heal Have any bosses asserted the 5 days to get you back?,ebgill411,16407930150,473

hqheep5,rr7div,As someone who works in healthcare I understand covid is real I see it all the time But at the same time even those who are triple vaxxed etc are tired of constantly being told to feel like they cant see any of their loved ones and cant get together with any of their friends but by God theyre going to work And theyre taking even less time off work now with a shorter quarantine People are ready to start living again even if it means having a small risk And at this point as far as Im concerned everybody can make their choice If you want a vaccine its there for you If you dont want it you make your choice Those under 5 years old are such an incredibly low risk anyways that its silly to refute that sentiment by saying "oh but 3 year olds cant get the shot!!" Its time to stop moving goal posts Its time to stop telling people that the only risk theyre allowed to take is going to work but theyre not allowed to take any risks seeing family Covid is real and you should get vaccinated but I can easily understand and agree with why this messaging is absolutely infuriating to so many,SaltySpitoonReg,16408247210,60

We went in the space of a couple weeks from firing unvaccinated healthcare workers because they MIGHT get covid and MIGHT go to work with it before they realize theyre contagious to directly telling sick workers to report to work after testing positive and still being contagious Im not sure whats guiding us right now but it sure as crap isnt science Id say I cant believe how quickly the CDC bowed to corporate pressure but theyve been a complete disaster since the very beginning of this pandemic TWO YEARS AGO and have learned nothing so maybe I can believe it The idea that "most of the transmission occurs in these 5 days so its not a big deal" may or may not be true but just to put it into perspective the numbers I saw indicated that you are about 30 times more likely to spread covid outside this window than you are to die of covid if you catch it Would we say "Most of the people who catch covid wont die so its not a big deal"? Absolutely not! Weve been saying things like "Wear masks they arent perfect but every little bit helps" "Skip christmas every little bit helps" "get vaccinated every little bit helps"and then we turn around say "You know what nevermind everyone come on back to work even though we KNOW some of you will STILL be contagious" Funny how only individuals are asked to sacrifice to make every little bit help,Krytan,16416687040,9

hrs4mut,ryb5hr,I passed a kidney stone a few days ago this is my fourth one and the second one in the last year It was very small I have some naproxen here for other issues I took my naproxen for the pain and did not go to the hospital I called my doctor and made an appointment for next week to get a scan to make sure that theres no more stones and a test for a UTI The wait time to get seen in the hospital is 10 to 20 hours here even though I live near a big city and there are dozens of hospitals that I could choose from What would be the point of me going to sit in an ER to wait for pain medication for 20 hours and get scanned? This is normally something that you would go to the ER for and get intravenous pain medicine even if its just toradol and let them go ahead and do a scan on you to see if you have any more kidney stones But right now its not life-threatening so you dont go to the ER And I could have went to the urgent Care the next day but theyre also backed up and you could be in there all day And if Im waiting 24 hours anyway for care why not just go to my primary in a few days? Thats also the reality of this not only are people dying because of this but youre not going to be able to get the regular care for situations that are extremely painful And if this was not like my fourth kidney stone and if I didnt have other chronic health issues where I had decent at home pain medication (even if not opiates which I dont take) I wouldnt know what was going on and I would have been in a lot of pain So Im very angry about the situation and folks are going to have to get their crap together,morbidbutwhoisnt,16416528020,4

hrpiprf,ryb5hr,If Omicron hospitalizations are a third of previous variants but more than three times the number of people get it then you have the same issue as previous waves Worse if its 4x or 5x I feel for healthcare workers right now,MrBubbles226,16415992030,2
hrqp83o,ryb5hr,I have covid I went to urgent care on Wednesday to get tested because I thought it was strep and Id need antibiotics Nope its most likely the omicron variant Anyway the line was out the door By the time I saw the doctor he looked so exhausted I feel bad for our healthcare workers and Im double vaccinated,Similar_Gold,16416183550,2

hrrujw9,ryb5hr,From the article: "Medicine runs on an unspoken social contract in which medical professionals expect themselves to sacrifice their own well-being for their patients" This has always been my problem with the "healthcare is a human right" arguments If health care requires the sacrifice of someone else in order to be provided how can it be a human right? I feel like this is becoming more and more apparent as healthcare workers quit How are they obligated to provide health care to ungrateful and non-compliant individuals risking their own health? In my experience healthcare is a risky and oftentimes brutal struggle against death It can be painful humiliating and traumatizing Which is why sometimes patients refuse treatment Describing it as a human right is just ridiculous When there is no one left to provide this "right" then what happens? Does it stop being a right? If no one is around to intubate you do you still have your right to health care?,chromatic-tonality,16416474760,3
hrpb059,ryb5hr,The hospitalizations are definitely on the rise again and it is hard to predict the peak The healthcare system doesnt have a lot of margin to adjust so this has been a really tough time for every level of the system The good news though is that there are significantly fewer hospitalizations per case so far when compared to all the previous waves In Pennsylvania where one of the doctor interviewed is working the average new cases per day is 22000 and the total number of hospitalized patients is 5600 During the delta wave as the new case levels were nearing their peak in mid September there were only 5800 cases but hospitalizations were already at 2300 4 times as many cases but only twice as many hospitalizations Twice as many hospitalizations terrible for sure but still below the number on the initial wave The article also states that hospitalizations fall 2 weeks behind cases I dont see that trend in the data Total hospitalizations start to go down a week to 10 days after cases start to go down but that is from people being released from the hospital The upward side of the trend seems to be no more than a couple days behind the case count and sometimes not even that All these numbers generally jive in the national numbers as well though with different dates Like I said I feel for hospital workers and their struggle is very real But I think it is helpful to mention the positive trends with the negative ones especially in a time where it can seem like the only news we get is negative Vaccines ARE working Omicron IS less severe than Delta and the mortality rate has been declining consistently There is hope for things to get better (This data is pulled from the CDCs COVID Data Tracker Not posting a link to respect subreddit rules),intrepidpursuit,16415960970,2
hro1z8d,ryb5hr,True our hospital is getting hammered with admissions Top virologists have said its not "mild" compared to previous strains the HK study lacks time zero and measures the wrong quantifier Maybe "less severe" but not mild The good news is it can be mild like any COVID-19 infection for anyone whos vaccinated including health care workers who are well past 6 months 2nd shot to demonstrate long memory B and T cells We only admit people that need hospital intervention,JoshuaAncaster,16415792930,-3

Am I fine with the first two shots? If someone is just now getting vaccinated should they take all three in the shortest window of time thats recommended?

hspm73t,rw0223,Another though to consider is that the continuous vaccine-rollout doesnt synergize with people who were sick and recovered naturally With Omicron there is a much larger part of the population who already have the equivalence of a vaccine shot from being recently infected but since they never got tested they dont realize it For the old Covid strains this portion of the population was negligible but with this many infected in a short time it could become a factor,Metaplayer,16422120420,1

hra568s,rw0223,I dont know why this booster or continued boosters is a shock to anyone?

How are you gonna put your faith in other people when half your population either refuses to get vaccinated or buys fake vaccination certificates? How do you trust anyone?

ha7111a,pamuzn,after pumping the message of "get vaxed resume life" nonstop putting a new message like this out there which will be interpreted as: "on an individual level theres an undefined amount of additional work to be done afterwards and then maybe well see" is counterproductive imo we cant get double the vaccines in our arms to make up for the stubborn idiots we cant put twice the amount of masks on to make up for the people that dont wear them and we cant lockdown twice as hard for the idiots that partied on spring break throughout the previous peaks reward good reward and punish bad the work that still needs to be done is with local leaders hospitals setting policy companies setting policy for staff etc pivoting from "get vaccinated resume life" to "get vaccinated require vaccines for those ready to resume life resume life" seems like an easier more actionable pivot to accomplish something (besides just inspiring defeatism) than "get vaccinated hope that the dumbest lowlifes catch on eventually and maybe next year you get to live again but stay tuned" on a community level if we could require vaccines/proof of negative tests to participate in "normal" life sooner i think hammering that message would do more to incentivize individuals than when only looking at things nationally/globally good luck getting the crowd that has already done everything more or less right during quarantines mandates etc to continue paying attention while they watched a bunch of hicks bury their heads in the sand cancel out any progress and continue to stay tuned in after already sacrificing a year of life i know its complicated but seems so counterproductive not to spend time also highlighting the spots in the country that succeeded and have been able to have more normalcy already and to balance the national/international gloom and doom with the stark contrast from the cities and communities that have done it right look at floridas deaths currently surpassing the deaths of their previous peaks LONG AFTER A VACCINE HAS BEEN WIDELY AVAILABLE TO THEIR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS (eg 999% of the people that die from covid) then look at the cities that have reached 60-70%+ fully vaxed having music festivals outdoors with no burden on hospital capacity and (except for those highly at risk to begin with those in nursing homes or in healthcare or education) apart from slapping a mask on in an uber and grocery store already are back to normal it was (supposed to be) a team effort until there was a vaccine available for the most at risk which many never participated in or actively sabotaged while others did their part but now that there is a vaccine for the majority of the population and the majority of older folks have gotten it it isnt going to be a one-size-fits-all approach for each individual: qualifying for a vaccine vax rates in the individuals community co-morbidity occupation contact (or lack of contact) with at-risk or groups that cant yet get vaccinated all realistically play more of a role on how much "normal" you get to have the broader context is necessary but its an increasingly hard sell in healthy vaccinated populations to continue to buckle down seemingly endlessly when life itself is insanely short my community has done what it takes and it makes no sense to send a message to the group that has followed marching orders to now wait for the lowlifes in florida to catch up and then maybe u get your normal well be getting boosters before they get a faction of these morons vaccinated fuck em i think about all my friends that own businesses in chicago that barely stayed afloat before there was a vaccine reading this seeing this new "maybe" date (when it could instead be as simple as letting businesses set a policy to reward folks for getting vaccinated) because of some downstate/out of state hillbillies and it makes me sick,lisaleftsharklopez,16298309000,4

Yes I was still there You wouldnt believe how sick I would be at school Id get home and pass out and wake up the next morning and be rushed out the door even if I was fevered sore throat unable to talk not coherent coughing vomiting running nose diarrhea the whole 9 yards And I dont believe it should be this way because I know for a fact I probably made dozens of others sick by doing that and they would show up at school sick too with the same symptoms It was hell and I wish families didnt send their kids to school sick I probably wouldnt have never gotten sick if no one had come to school sick in the first place,0MidnightSolv,16387533150,14
hnflckn,r9otza,Ive been teaching in China for 18 years and this is par for the course Ill first say Ive always worked in the private sector and there have been times that Ive been outsourced to public schools on occasion while working with a few schools in the past What a gong show Not criticizing China Just humanity in general So I came **right** after the WHO lifted the SARS travel ban to China Id planned on moving to China earlier and SARS ended up delaying my departure by a few months There are always sick kids coming to school It really broke my heart Id see kids as young as 4 years old coming to class run down and sick It just made me think "if youre going to run your kid into the ground like this at this age what kind of physical condition can you expect them to be in when theyre 30?" When H1N1 was a thing I was working 3 afternoons a week at a high school and DAMN I had classes where students were constantly going to the bathroom to puke their guts out 1/4-1/3 of the students were clearly effected I constantly encouraged them to go home but they didnt see it as an option because their teachers and parents didnt accept the practice of saying home to get better and not risk spreading their illness to others A few years later I had a kid come to school looking kinda sick and before class I asked the girls mother and she upright admitted that she was aware that her child was infected with FMD which can be extremely fatal to humans who are younger/have less developed immune systems I couldnt believe this woman I informed my co-workers of the situation We immediately locked all of the classrooms because we didnt want anyone in the other classrooms to get infected It literally took over an hour to convince the mother to take her child out of the school It was literally impossible to convince her that shed done something wrong by taking her child outside let alone to a school filled with other younglings She attempted to fight the manager when we told her that she wouldnt be able to bring her child back into the school without proof from a local hospital that her daughter was no longer contagious After the insane woman left we spent a few hours sanitizing everything in the school It must have been a weird experience for the kids and teachers in the other classrooms They normally would have finished class a long time ago and would have been let out of the classroom for breaks but they had to just hang out in the classroom while we insured that wed done our best to make sure it was safe for the kids to come out TBH we shouldnt have had anything to do with this process There should have been some division of the government to contact to have them ensure that this is done properly especially given how this disease is famous for coming through areas and taking the lives of children in waves but yeah we didnt have such a luxury at our disposal COVID wasnt nearly as bad The government had clearly learned from SARS and figured out a way to deal with it in their own way After the COVID lockdown had ended it was really nice to see so many kids come to class wearing masks I even had co-workers wearing masks when they had a cold which is something I couldnt have imagined happening ever before COVID COVID really made me question why the hell we havent been wearing masks when under the weather all of these years I think it should be a given You shouldnt be free to spread your germs when youre feeling ill just regardless of whether or not you live in a free country,ThaddCorbett,16387743750,13

Of course But how else do we do this?

h8f0php,p1oqh4,Its no shocker to me A lot of my family and friends live in Florida Back in late June i went down to surprise my father for his 69th birthday I thought since I was fully vaccinated and cases were at their lowest since the start of the pandemic there was never going to be a better time to go I hadnt seen him in 10 years I wasnt sure I would see him again so I took the risk and drove down This trip was highly unusual Normally I would get in contact with everyone and try to spend time with as many people as I could This was more a top secret mission Ive been paying attention to everyones social media posts I knew since i had a high risk son at home there were many folks I did not want to see (He has heart failure one kidney and immuno-compromised from a cancer diagnosis as a toddler)The need to know list was minimal Even though neither of my parents are vaccinated I knew it was ok to visit my father He is living off the system and had most things delivered at his home He only left to buy cigarettes and beer and got them at a window I asked my mom to get tested because she hasnt changed her way of living since all this started Anti masker bible thumping Christian who goes to church and Costco twice a week This church sets aside a half hour after service for fellowship community dining and affection(hugging and spreading love) I visited a handful of friends One group knew i was coming down before anyone else They all were fully vaccinated and quarantined themselves before I arrived Chatting with them made me realize that most Floridians just dont care about following the rules Its always been business as usual down there Theres been major events like concerts live DJ performances and parties weekly Ive seen tons of posts from packed venues Nobody wearing masks all crammed tightly in a building One night I visited my best friend since high school We got to chat while smoking a fat bowl (she bought a new piece just for me for my visit) and she said it perfectly "Florida just dont give a fuck about Covid" Its that frame of mind why Florida will be hit mega hard by this variant Theres a huge number of unvaccinated people down there You have the younger crowd partying like its 1999 mixing with a massive older retired population A recipe for disaster Even with this new variant and numbers skyrocketing they still just dont care With Summer coming to a close soon all of the snowbirds will start arriving again Just in time as the Delta is getting in gear I probably shouldnt have taken the drive down or seen as many people as I did But like I said cases were at their lowest and most of the small number of people I visited were vaccinated I caught a lot of flak once everyone found out I was down and never stopped in Those that knew I was coming also knew the situation with my son and took precaution Most of the time spent together was outdoors and distanced at a persons home The only home I went in was my Fathers I knew it was only a matter of time before a new variant swept through the Sunshine State Im glad I went when I did My dad is a chain smoker and ex hardcore drug addict I never once seen him eat when i was there Beer and cigarettes thats it Didnt matter if it was 8 in the morning or midnight Alcohol and nicotine If you heard him cough you would know he doesnt have much time left on Earth I had to go down to see him when the opportunity was there,ac1dre1gn77,16286075150,97

h8g1hqm,p1oqh4,I believe its really important for parents to have an idea of the risks of COVID to children so Ive been doing some research recently to assess the risks **I am not an expert -- so I welcome any comments -- but thought this may be helpful as parents navigate this worrisome time** (sorry if youve seen this before -- Ive reposted this on threads that talk about kids and COVID because I think its important to have some idea behind the risks): **Morality Risks:** Obviously theres an extremely fine line to walk here: every death of a child is horrendously tragic and I cannot imagine being the parent of a child who has died or been hospitalized The good news for parents however is that mortality risks still remain low [Out of 74000000 kids in the US 519 have died of COVID since the crisis began (as of July 28)](https://wwwnytimescom/2021/07/29/well/family/back-to-school-covidhtml) This works out to a mortality rate of 00007% or 0015% amongst those who had had confirmed cases of COVID Again this is immensely tragic -- simply put no child should die -- but if I were a parent Id probably be more worried about the prospects for long-term COVID symptoms (discussed below) **Risks of Delta:** Delta is new so there is still much we do not know However data from the UK (where Delta has hit for some time now) gives us some clues Lets start with the good news: [based on data from the UK kids remain the least impacted age group by a long shot](https://wwwonsgovuk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19latestinsights/hospitals#hospital-admissions-by-age)Despite not having access to vaccines kids age 5-14 still have had by far the lowest hospitalization rates of any demographic (this past week its been 108/100000; kids age 0-4 have had noticeably higher rates -- 312/100k -- though still lower than any other age group) Similarly the chance a child would be hospitalized if they had a confirmed case of COVID was similar to prior waves and maybe even a little bit lower The bad news? Well more kids are going to get Delta on account of it being more transmissible particularly in areas where schools arent taking any precautions We all know it and were seeing it now but Delta is insanely more transmissible The fact were already seeing records for hospitalizations amongst kids is extremely bad to say the least The fact this is already occurring with no indications cases nationally are close to peaking is really troubling (An aside: interestingly the UK never break their record for youth hospitalizations with Delta but were breaking it now I really dont know but if anyone has insight itd be interesting to hear) **Risks of Long COVID/The Disease Course More Generally:** We still have lots to learn about long COVID and Delta is new enough that current studies dont really address it For COVID more generally however the earliest studies suggested frighteningly high rates of long-lasting symptoms (one even pegged it at a third!) But these suffered from immense methodological weaknesses such as low sample sizes parental-reported symptoms probable selection bias and no control groups More recent research (which isnt perfect and still includes many of the above weaknesses but is at least somewhat better) has suggested much lower rates than the first studies albeit the risks are real A sampling of some of the more recent work include: * [In a self-reported survey in the UK over 95% of infected kids had no symptoms lasting longer than four weeks and 98% had no symptoms more than 56 days](https://wwwthelancetcom/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext)(and if Im understanding the study correctly it only analyzed kids with symptomatic COVID so there would be lower rates for all infections) * [In a survey from the UK of people who had COVID an estimated 74% of children aged 2-11 reported any symptoms 12 weeks after infection](https://wwwonsgovuk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/prevalenceofongoingsymptomsfollowingcoronaviruscovid19infectionintheuk/1april2021) (this study included a control group) * [In one study with a control group researchers found that kids infected with COVID in Zurich actually were no more likely to report symptoms of long-COVID than kids who were not infected](https://wwwnaturecom/articles/d41586-021-01935-7)To be clear: this study does not imply that long-Covid does not occur However if true it suggests the actual prevalence of long-COVID in kids is likely quite low (This is definitely the most encouraging study I found) So whats the average course of the illness in most children (again with the caveat that most research is pre-Delta)? First off it seems that \~50% of children will be totally asymptomatic ([the Lancet study](https://wwwthelancetcom/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext) cites a source suggesting between 43-68% of cases are asymptomatic) Of those with symptoms the one study found the median symptom duration is 6 days with the most common symptoms being headache and fatigue (see previous link) Three final notes: First we need to be careful when discussing long-COVID and differentiate between symptoms that are bad but manageable (and resolve over time) and symptoms which are debilitating Unfortunately to my understanding current research has not really addressed this adequately In the Lancet study at least (first bullet point) the most common symptoms that lasted in the children who had lasting symptoms were 1) fatigue 2) loss of smell and 3) (to a lesser degree) headaches This doesnt really resolve the question -- depending on the levels of fatigue for example it certainly can be debilitating -- but I think this is something we really shouldnt lose sight of when discussing long-COVID Second: Ive seen concerns on here about organ damage and the like I havent really seen great studies focusing on this on children (I very well may have missed some so do not take this as gospel) Moreover in the studies Ive run across on adults theres lots of jargon and its not always clear what the medical implications of certain findings are Thus I havent really focused on it here -- not because it might not exist but because its above my expertise and I do not want to misinterpret findings Third risks -- even quantified -- are hard to interpret and people will probably have different reactions to the same numbers Lets say [the Lancet study](https://wwwthelancetcom/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext) (showing 18% of children with symptomatic COVID have any symptoms lasting >56 days) is correct On the one hand -- if your child catches COVID -- this means he/she is extremely unlikely to have symptoms that last that long One the other hand -- this still means lots of kids will have symptoms that last a long time **Takeaways:** Building off this last point: people will look at the above data and likely come to different conclusions For me I look at it and feel somewhat reassured -- its not at all that theres zero risk (theres definitely not) and whats currently happening is absolutely tragic but the data speaks to somewhat lower risks than the impression Id likely get if I spent my whole day on this sub But then again Im also not a parent Others may look at the data (particularly the long-COVID studies) and still very reasonably feel worried **In any event -- and I know Im preaching to the choir here -- the most important thing you can do to protect the kids around you is get vaccinated And if you happen to be a parent with a children age 12 or over whos on the fence please get them vaccinated too Itll protect your child from a truly nasty disease and help lower the risk for those around your child too**,Adodie,16286229860,6

h8fkmbw,p1oqh4,I really appreciate https://covid19healthdataorg unlike other sites they are trying to predict how the virus behave it is not live I think they update it once a week (I would guess the computations are too expensive to run it in real time) Anyway in order to make good predictions they also need to have more accurate estimate about real infections https://covid19healthdataorg/united-states-of-america/florida?view=infections-testing&tab=trend&test=positive_tests If you adjust the graph to show the entire pandemic from the beginning and switch to "confirmed infections" you will see that the spike is getting there to the same numbers as in the winter It still havent hit the peak though Now switch to "estimated infections" It is almost three times as high as the highest peak during winter Estimating 90K/day infections,CSI_Tech_Dept,16286159150,4
h8fv8hj,p1oqh4,There are two factors at play here: * Floridas state ban on school mask mandates * Increased Transmission from Delta There have been some [pretty robust](https://wwwnytimescom/2021/08/10/opinion/covid-schools-maskshtml) [studies](https://abcsciencecollaborativeorg/report-shows-that-n-c-k-12-schools-reopened-safely-paving-the-way-for-schools-nationwide-to-limit-covid-19-spread-in-the-classroom/) that show that at least for last years variants in-person education had very low transmission rates so long as everyone was wearing masks So the question is how much of this transmission is due to students not masking and how much is due to the increased transmission rate of the Delta variant? As the parent of kids who are in a school district thats headed back to in-person-with-masks-required school in a few weeks my hope is that masks are still effective enough to allow for safe in-person learning until under-12s can get vaccinated But we really dont know that yet If my kids were headed back to school tomorrow with the data we have available today in an environment where masks are required Id likely send them with N95 masks But well see what things look like in a few weeks when I have to make that decision for realsies,AtOurGates,16286203390,3

hkzxv30,qw0f3o,Disclosure: I got my booster as soon as I could Im generally in favor of boosters However my family was directly exposed to COVID multiple times after we were "fully vaccinated" as the Delta wave swept our area At one point it was said that getting Delta on top of fully vaccinated (or vice versa) provided a really strong immune boost (Dont intentionally do this in case you do have a bad breakthrough case) Are we to assume this is no longer the case? Also I have an autoimmune disorder I have had flares with this and other vaccines I am a little concerned about the inflammation from multiple vaccines Even though risk analysis is that the virus is riskier than the vaccine at what point does that start to no longer be the case?

hl054ad,qw0f3o,Some vaccines require multiple doses and others dont The annual flu vaccine is because the flu variants change yearly The vaccine is actually different every year The Covid booster is currently because efficiency wanes over time Since Covid mutates much like the flu it seems unlikely that 3 doses of the same vaccine will be the standard in the long run My guess is that we switch to 6-12 month vaccine shots for life where the manufactures adjust the vaccine to match newer variants I would also love a science break through so that we can increase the speed at which vaccines are approved while also upping the safety,ILoveSherri,16371663510,-9

guklcqu,mqz31i,This was hidden in that earlier AP/NORC poll from mid-February that a lot of people cited to generalize about "vaccine hesitancy": https://apnorcorg/projects/safety-concerns-remain-main-driver-of-vaccine-hesitancy/ Some have noted 15% of all adults said they were certain they would not get vaccinated Alternatively and contrasting the overall adult hesitancy 7% of people 60+ yrs old said they were certain they would not get it 507% of all adults had not committed to getting a vaccine (86% unvaccinated of which 59% combined would (only) probably get a vaccine probably not get a vaccine or definitely not get a vaccine) 13% had been vaccinated already including 9% (72% of those 13%) having just one shot and 1% of those 9% = 01% not planning to receive all required doses So ~51% of adults had not committed (yet) to being vaccinated Of those 51% uncommitted 35% thought other people needed it more than them at that time 10% were concerned about cost and 7% had not been recommended by their doctor (all together 52% about cost doctor and priority of those 51% uncommitted) So the fraction of all adults who hadnt committed to vaccination included ~265% of adults who were waiting for their doctor their turn or the cost,mandy009,16184610710,2
gul7s88,mqz31i,How about the statistics for how many Americans are working too many hours and cant take the time off of work to get one? Or who have 3 weeks of travel back to back? Yeah Im not planning on getting one until towards the end of May hopefullyAt least itll be like a video game releasethe vaccines will have a patch or two on em by then? Lol jk,TomCei,16184813250,2
gujxn3i,mqz31i,I had the first shot at CVS and even though I stated I had not insurance when I scheduled the appointment online they still asked me for proof of insurance three times while checking in despite the day before I stopped by to ask and they told me that if I had not insurance then itd be covered by some federal program But honestly Im expecting that some sort of bill will show up by mail at some point in the near future,sigmmakappa,16184477610,2
gukdqab,mqz31i,I wonder how many people are like me in that Im seriously concerned about side effects of the shot I was a premie and was stabbed with so many needles that it took me a long time to get a flu shot I got so friggin sick in December 2019 that I fear feeling the same thing from the vaccine Dry cough for 2 weeks took so many decongestive medicines and nothing Fever chills lack of taste/smell but not sure how noticeable as Covid wasnt a known thing The cough was so bad that i was scared to cough and while waiting at the hospital lobby for my physical for my job i coughed and my body locked up At the time I was in the process of getting my job in another state and had to drive the 10+ hours one way That was pure hell Was it Covid? Dunno not a doctor Ive had the flu before but this was something else SO got the shot its a matter of time before i need to but Im scared to death of the side effects Not trying to come off as antivax just anxiety I wear my mask everywhere edit: Sooooooo I did the thing for the greater good and took the shot Definitely teetered on the edge of anxiety and panic as I hate needles Had a staph/blood infection in my finger a long time ago and they inserted the needle from the tip of my finger downward about 1/4in so that was the most intense pain didnt feel anything on this covid shot but now im waiting for crappy symptoms,exccord,16184563220,2
gujcfyn,mqz31i,It is NOT free It is either covered by your insurance or the government is covering the cost with more borrowed money You may not have to pay for it at time of service but I can assure you the vaccine maker/distributor/administrator is getting money for their product and/or services I am not saying we should be doing it any other way but free is not a word I would use to describe the vaccine,sskj2016,16184368980,-13

gukslvo,mqz31i,Since day one it was very clear that vaccinations would be free we cant beat it without herd immunity People not educating themselves and others on this pandemic is probably what I hate most about it apart from the 500k+ deaths Being informed by keeping up with weekly updates is extremely easy to do and available to anyone with a television or radio even easier with a computer All the extra time people have it baffles the mind how ignorant even the most well meaning people are Im beginning to doubt well ever live without covid restrictions again in our life time folks just arent seeing this situation for what it really is were never going back to "normal" I mean people can pretend do their best to ignore what they want to covid will keep mutating among the non-vaccinated and well continue to play cat and mouse with vaccines forever probably Edit: Cant for the life of me figure out why the down votes its reality folks do your research before "feeling" your reaction to unsavory facts,Garbanxo,16184666420,-1

hemif18,pxc6hb,So many people have been blaming Lebron for the anti-vaxx sentiment in the NBA Turns out hes already vaccinated Take that haters The Lakers are fully vaccinated EDIT: Also his endorsement on getting vaccinated carries sway in both the NBA and to the public,PepeBabinski,16328532770,43

heps9us,pxc6hb,Seriously people who were skeptical by this "medicine" while getting all kind of medicine from their teams doctor all the time without questioning are just dumb Like literally dumb How can you start questioning something suddenly that you never questioned before?

The idea that you wouldnt be taking care of your sick parent is disgusting to me Thats whats wrong with society Humans used to live in strong unbreakable tribes where the elders were respected and protected Now we put our elders in old people homes or leave them in hospitals Not me I have a 3 story house and multiple acres of land and I have all of my siblings including cousins and niece/nephews living with me! When one of us gets sick we ALL pitch in to take care of them! My great aunt died of cancer just like you said but we didnt have to pay anything after she died We actually got paid Yall make the US look bad but really youre just living wrong Families shouldnt separate they should live under one roof or in the same community within speaking distance,LeviThaKat,16380198270,1

hy5b95h,szo1gx,And no one cares I live in Louisiana and no one ever really took the virus seriously it was all a joke to a very very high percentage of the population here They will say that its not 1 million people that if you died of a car wreck the hospital marked you down as a covid death driving the numbers up Ive heard countless times from people say "well its just natural selection" and other BS like this To say I am ashamed is an understatement I am working on getting my family out of here to move somewhere more like minded I just cannot deal with the ignorance anymore,ESB1812,16456489110,170
hy8lsaq,szo1gx,There is nothing normal about a population that wont universally take mitigating vaccines to buffer the health care system for all Thats called the USA 25% are so fucking stupid and selfish that we will see a large percentage of them die Time to get back to normal There are vaccines there are ways to mitigate There are antiviral treatments Now should we be adjusting some of our normal policies to account for the Covid? sure How about more sick days for people How about FMLA? How about making it so that people who die of Covid especially if they were vaccinated have their families cared for? Probably not gonna happen but its time to stop fucking around and get back to normal Take your vaccines get your treatments wear your mask and lets try to get through this It is endemic,Forsaken-Shallots17,16457096670,2
hy5jzle,szo1gx,Its time to start thinking of Covid deaths by year and not over all total its a single point of data that tells us nothing about how were doing Looking at year over year numbers we will be able to start seeing trends and determining what direction were going in No one just looks at the raw total of deaths for other diseases most of them we have no idea anyways If all we ever said about the flu was its killed 20000000000 people or whatever the number would even be then we would constantly just be terrified of it Instead we look at how many cases and deaths it causes per year thats actually useful information the total is only good for people to get freaked out and to cluck their tongues about what a disgrace the response has been,kmo9e,16456521080,34
hy64xwv,szo1gx,Its definitely not normal its a (hopefully) once in a century tragedy! The question is what else can we do? We locked down and started masking in hopes we drove the virus to extinction That didnt work so we kept that up until we had a vaccine available By this point there is a safe effective vaccine that everyone besides small children can get and theyll hopefully be able to get it in the coming months We even have antivirals to combat the virus Whats the goal now? Lockdowns and masks arent going to stop the virus just buy us time by slowing it down And now we no longer know what were buying time for The flu pandemic never really ended we just stopped treating it as exceptional; covid will be the same as hard as that is to accept,yozaner1324,16456605180,5
hy7g5tb,szo1gx,I dont know what to tell internet people except that for a lot of us COVID changed nearly nothing The jobs didnt let us go home the bills kept coming no checks came in the mail except for those two that everyone mocked for being silly and not even covering one month of rent Unless we wanted to quit and stay home (no unemployment checks for quitters in the US) there was no real choice except to carry on mask up and go to work Its been same crap different day since March 2020 Sometimes you hear about somebodys granny passing away or your coworker goes home with COVID for two weeks while you pick up the slack and then they come back and thats the end of it Theres been a huge mismatch between the online wailing about COVID and the actual experience of living with it and when I say living with it I mean week in and week out in one of the industries where we had higher COVID death rates than the medical people did Line cooks dont take masking very seriously Too high probably think 5G is the virus MOST of the US has been in this boat the entire time The poor Amazon workers didnt get a single day off they got overtime Only on the internet do people seem to live in this weird parallel universe defined by work from home and perpetual COVID measures Its been a hell of a thing to watch people act like thats normal It doesnt matter what I think of any of it I didnt even get to stay home from work for a week while I watched the whole world slam the shutters at once thats how much power I have Call me all the names you want Tell me Im stupid or whatever I have no control over your situation Outside of your bubble its been "normal" this entire time Its been two solid years of everyone carrying on more or less as usual The virus has somehow avoided presenting a face to the public that would make them treat it like a mortal threat the way things like Ebola did and the bosses arent letting anyone off the hook since they can all stay home safe if they wanna Youre the educated middle class not me Youre the ones who should have come up with some sort of way to force whatever it is youre wanting on the world Perpetual work from home? I dont know what you want You had the money resources safety and time to do something about it politically All I know is that everyone has been living in "normal" for a quarter of a decade except for you deaths or no deaths It seems that all your kind can really muster is thinkpieces like this one that tell everyone what they already know and that will fail to convince anyone who doesnt want to know Its just ineffective handwringing except for maybe this writer made a buck from it Maybe Mourn if you want to but theyre obviously going to drag you all back into the offices by your scruffs that or fire you Again its been "normal" since like June 2020 and it looks like its finally your turn at that shit sandwich Whatever the hell this is thats normal now,AttackPug,16456826160,6
